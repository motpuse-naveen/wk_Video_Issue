<h4 class="h4" id="s1141">Neutropenia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count less than 2,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. It is the result of decreased production of neutrophils or increased destruction of cells (see <a href="#ct29-5">Chart 29-5</a>). Neutrophils are essential in preventing and limiting bacterial infection. A patient with neutropenia is at increased risk for infection from both exogenous and endogenous sources (the GI tract and skin are common endogenous sources). The risk for infection is based not only on the severity of the neutropenia but also on its duration. The actual number of neutrophils, known as the <strong>absolute neutrophil count (ANC)</strong>, is determined by a simple mathematical calculation using information from the CBC and differential (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of the ANC). The risk for infection increases proportionately with a decrease in the neutrophil count. The risk is low when the ANC is greater than 1000/mm<sup>3</sup>, and high when less than 500/mm<sup>3</sup> and greatest when less than 100/mm<sup>3</sup> (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Dale &#x0026; Welte, 2016</a>). The duration of neutropenia is another risk factor for developing infection as is the underlying etiology (see <a href="#ct29-6">Chart 29-6</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients with neutropenia do not always exhibit classic signs of infection. Fever is the most common indicator of infection, but is not always present, particularly if the patient is taking corticosteroids or is an older adult.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1143">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of neutropenia varies depending on its etiology. If the neutropenia is medication induced, the offending agent should be discontinued immediately whenever possible. Treatment of an underlying neoplasm can temporarily make the neutropenia worse, but after bone marrow recovery, treatment may improve it. Corticosteroids may be used if the neutropenia is caused by an immunologic disorder. The use of growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor can be effective in increasing neutrophil production when the cause is reduced cell production. Withholding or reducing the dose of chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary when the neutropenia is caused by these cancer treatments; however, when treatment is potentially curative, administration of growth factors is preferable so that the maximum antitumor effect of the cancer treatment can be achieved (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Lyman, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the neutropenia is associated with fever, it is assumed that the patient has an infection. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum, as well as a chest x-ray are obtained. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated immediately after cultures are obtained to ensure adequate treatment of infectious organisms. After culture and sensitivity results are obtained, the antibiotic regimen may be changed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1144">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses in all settings can play a crucial role in assessing the severity of neutropenia and in preventing and managing complications, which most often include infections. Knowledge of risk factors for developing infection is an integral part of nursing care, particularly for those who work with patients who have cancer. Patient education is equally important, particularly at the time of discharge from the hospital or in the outpatient setting so that the patient can put an appropriate self-care plan into effect, including knowing when to seek medical attention (see <a href="c29-sec09.xhtml#ct29-7">Chart 29-7</a>). Patients at risk for neutropenia should have blood drawn for a CBC with differential; the frequency is based on the suspected duration and severity of the neutropenia. To assess the severity of neutropenia and risk for infection, nurses must assess the ANC (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for formula). Nursing interventions related to neutropenia are delineated in Chapters 12 and 30.</p>
