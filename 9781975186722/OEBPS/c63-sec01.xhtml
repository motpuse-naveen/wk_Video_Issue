<h4 class="h4" id="s2997">Head Injuries</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Head injury is a broad classification that encompasses any damage to the head as a result of trauma. A head injury does not necessarily mean a brain injury is present. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;traumatic brain injury:&lt;/b&gt; an injury to the skull or brain that is severe enough to interfere with normal functioning (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; craniocerebral trauma)">Traumatic brain injury</button></strong> (TBI) or craniocerebral trauma describes an injury that is the result of an external force and is of sufficient magnitude to interfere with daily life and prompts the seeking of treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 2.9 million emergency department (ED) visits in the United States each year, the majority of which are for a mild TBI (CDC, 2019). As a result of TBI, approximately 56,800 people die (contributing to about 30% of all injury-related deaths), 288,000 are hospitalized, and 80,000 to 90,000 will have long-term disability (CDC, 2019; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Approximately 78% of patients are treated in the ED and released (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Williamson &#x0026; Rajajee, 2018</a>). The most common causes of TBIs are falls (48%), motor vehicle crashes (14%), being struck by objects (15%), and assaults (10%). Children up to 4 years of age, adolescents 15 to 19 years, and adults 65 years and older are most likely to sustain a TBI. In every age group, TBI rates are higher for males than for females (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). An estimated 5.3 million people are living with a TBI-related disability, producing an annual economic impact of approximately $76.5 billion due to medical expenses and the cost of lost productivity (CDC, 2019). The best approach to head injury is prevention (see <a href="#ct63-1">Chart 63-1</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2998">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Damage to the brain from traumatic injury takes two forms: primary injury and secondary injury. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;primary injury:&lt;/b&gt; initial damage to the brain that results from the traumatic event">Primary injury</button></strong> is defined as the consequence of direct contact to the head/brain during the instant of initial injury, causing extracranial focal injuries (e.g., contusions, lacerations, external hematomas, and skull fractures), as well as possible focal brain injuries from sudden movement of the brain within the cranial vault (e.g., subdural hematomas [SDHs], concussion, diffuse axonal injury [DAI]). The greatest opportunity for decreasing TBI is the implementation of prevention strategies (see <a href="#ct63-1">Chart 63-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;secondary injury:&lt;/b&gt; an insult to the brain subsequent to the original traumatic event">Secondary injury</button></strong> evolves over the ensuing hours and days after the initial injury and results from inadequate delivery of glucose and oxygen to the cells. Identification, prevention, and treatment of secondary injury are the main foci of early management of severe TBI. Contributors to this process include intracranial pathologic processes such as intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, intracranial hypertension, hyperemia, seizures, and vasospasm (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Kaur &#x0026; Sharma, 2018</a>). Systemic effects from hypotension, hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, infection, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia can also be factors which add to the complex biochemical, metabolic, and inflammatory changes that further compromise an injured brain (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Monro&#x2013;Kellie hypothesis, also known as the Monro&#x2013;Kellie doctrine, explains the dynamic equilibrium of cranial contents. The cranial vault contains three main components: brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). According to the Monro&#x2013;Kellie hypothesis, the cranial vault is a closed system, and if one of the three components increases in volume, at least one of the other two must decrease in volume or the pressure will increase. Any bleeding or swelling within the skull increases the volume of contents within the skull and therefore causes increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>). If the pressure increases enough, it can cause displacement of the brain through or against the rigid structures of the skull. This causes restriction of blood flow to the brain, decreasing oxygen delivery and waste removal. Cells within the brain become anoxic and cannot metabolize properly, producing ischemia, infarction, irreversible brain damage, and eventually brain death (see <a href="#ff63-1">Fig. 63-1</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Scalp Injury</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Isolated scalp trauma is generally classified as a minor injury. Because its many blood vessels constrict poorly, the scalp bleeds profusely when injured. Trauma may result in an abrasion (brush wound), contusion, laceration, or subgaleal hematoma (hematoma beneath the layers of tissue of the scalp) (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A large avulsion (tearing away) of the scalp may be potentially life-threatening and is a true emergency. Diagnosis of a scalp injury is based on physical examination, inspection, and palpation. Scalp wounds are potential portals of entry for organisms that cause intracranial infections. Therefore, the area is irrigated before the laceration is sutured to remove foreign material and to reduce the risk for infection (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hollander, 2019</a>). Subgaleal hematomas usually reabsorb and do not require any specific treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Skull Fractures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A skull fracture is a break in the continuity of the skull caused by forceful trauma. It may occur with or without damage to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2057" title="2057"></span>the brain. Skull fractures are classified by type and location. Types include linear, comminuted, and depressed skull fractures, whereas location fractures include frontal, temporal, and basal skull fractures. A simple (linear) fracture is a break in the continuity of the bone. A comminuted skull fracture refers to a splintered or multiple fracture line. Depressed skull fractures occur when the bones of the skull are forcefully displaced downward and can vary from a slight depression to bones of the skull being splintered and embedded within brain tissue. A fracture of the base of the skull is referred to as a basal skull fracture (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A fracture may be open, indicating a scalp laceration or tear in the dura (e.g., from a bullet or an ice pick), or closed, in which case the dura is intact.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2999">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms, apart from those of the local injury, depend on the severity and the anatomic location of the underlying brain injury. Persistent, localized pain usually suggests that a fracture is present. Fractures of the cranial vault may or may not produce swelling in the region of the fracture. Fractures of the base of the skull tend to traverse the paranasal sinus of the frontal bone or the middle ear located in the temporal bone. Therefore, they frequently produce hemorrhage from the nose, pharynx, or ears, and blood may appear under the conjunctiva. An area of ecchymosis (bruising) may be seen over the mastoid (Battle sign). Basal skull fractures are suspected when CSF escapes from the ears (CSF otorrhea) and the nose (CSF rhinorrhea). Drainage of CSF is a serious problem, because meningeal infection can occur if organisms gain access to the cranial contents via the nose, ear, or sinus through a tear in the dura.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3000"> <img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Military personnel in combat roles are at increased risk for TBI, with a prevalence rate ranging from 15% to 23% (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Turgoose &#x0026; Murphy, 2018</a>). A common cause of TBI in a veteran is a combat-related blast injury from various forms of improvised explosive devices. Unlike TBI in the civilian population, which causes a primary and secondary injury, TBI in the military population causes four levels of injury (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Chapman &#x0026; Diaz-Arrastia, 2014</a>). The primary injury is due to the atmospheric overpressure followed by underpressure or vacuum. The secondary injury occurs when objects are placed in motion (shrapnel) by the blast, hitting the service member. Tertiary injury occurs when the service member is thrown by the blast and hits their head against the ground, a wall, or other solid surface. Quaternary injury involves other injuries from the blast, such as burns and crush injuries. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest significant differences between a blast injury and a blunt brain injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies do not indicate any microstructural differences. It appears there are no cognitive differences either. Treatment options for a veteran with TBI are the same as those for a civilian with TBI; however, veterans can have complex needs, especially those with multiple injuries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3001">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A computed tomography (CT) scan can be used to diagnose a skull fracture. The ease with which a diagnosis of skull fracture is made depends on the site of the fracture. If a fracture is found on CT scan, there is always the question of associated brain injury, and an MRI scan provides better resolution and clearer pictures of the injured area (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3002"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older patients with head injuries differ from those who are younger in terms of etiology of injury, higher mortality rates, longer lengths of hospital stay, and worse functional outcomes (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4428">Thompson, Rivara, &#x0026; Wang, 2020</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct63-2">Chart 63-2</a>). Neurologic assessment can be challenging, as the older adult patient with a TBI can have hearing or visual deficits or preexisting dementia or cognitive issues, making establishment of a neurologic baseline difficult. The most common causes of injury in older adult patients are falls and motor vehicle crashes. Approximately 81% of all TBIs among adults aged 65 years and older result from falls (CDC, 2019). Physiologic changes related to aging may place the older adult at increased risk for injury, alter the type and severity of injury that occurs, or lead to complications.</p>
<p class="indent">Several factors place older adults at increased risk for hematomas. Brain weight decreases, the dura becomes more adherent to the skull, and reaction times slow with increasing age (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4394">Battaglini, Gentile, Luchetti, et al., 2019</a>). Also, many older adults take aspirin and anticoagulant agents as part of routine management of chronic conditions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3003">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nondepressed skull fractures generally do not require surgical treatment; however, close observation of the patient is essential. Nursing personnel may observe the patient in the hospital, but if no underlying brain injury is present, the patient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2058" title="2058"></span>may be allowed to return home. If the patient is discharged home, specific instructions must be given to the family (see later discussion of concussion).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Head Injury in Older Adults</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Thompson, H. J., Rivara, F. P., &#x0026; Wang, J. (2020). Symptoms, function, and outcomes in the first year after mild-moderate traumatic brain injury. <em>Journal of Neuroscience Nursing</em>, <em>52</em>(2), 46&#x2013;52.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Older adults have higher rates of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and death for traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to younger adults. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the injury trajectory at 1 year for older and younger adults who had a TBI.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 33 adults who had a mild to moderate TBI. Participants were recruited in the ED and followed for 1 year. Data were collected on symptoms, function using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Functional Status Examination, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for 1 week, then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the injury.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The total number of symptoms did not differ when younger and older adults were compared, but the symptoms clusters were different. Older adults reported more physical symptoms such as fatigue, balance and coordination problems, and being bothered by noise. Younger adults reported more psychological symptoms such as anxiety. Function measured on the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Functional Status Examination was lower in older adults at 1 year post injury compared to younger adults. Physical HRQOL was lower in older adults consistently over the year compared to younger adults. In contrast, mental HRQOL was higher in older adults.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses working with older adults, who have had a TBI should know that they report different symptoms clusters compared to younger adults. Nursing interventions with older adults who have had a TBI should focus on balance, coordination, as well as energy conservation measures to minimize fatigue and other measures to reduce environmental noises.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Depressed skull fractures usually require surgery with elevation of the skull and d&#x00E9;bridement, usually within 24 hours of injury. Skull fractures can be a combination of open, compound, closed, or simple. Associated injuries include concurrent scalp laceration, dural tears, and brain injury directly below the fracture from compression of the tissue below the bony injury and from lacerations produced by the bony fragments (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
