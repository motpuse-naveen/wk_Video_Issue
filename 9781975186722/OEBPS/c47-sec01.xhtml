<h4 class="h4" id="s2082">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A focused assessment of kidney and urinary tract function requires an understanding of the anatomy and physiology of these systems.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2083">Anatomy of the Kidney and Urinary Systems</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The kidney and urinary systems include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Urine is formed by the kidney and flows through the other structures to be eliminated from the body.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Kidneys</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped, brownish-red structures located retroperitoneally (behind and outside the peritoneal cavity) on the posterior wall of the abdomen&#x2014;from the 12th thoracic vertebra to the 3rd lumbar vertebra in the adult (see <a href="#ff47-1">Fig.&#x00A0;47-1</a>A). The rounded outer convex surface of each kidney is called the hilum. Each hilum is penetrated with blood vessels, nerves, and the ureter. The average adult kidney weighs approximately 113 to 170 g (about 4.5 oz) and is 10 to 12 cm long, 6 cm wide, and 2.5 cm thick (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Russell, 2017</a>). The right kidney is slightly lower than the left due to the location of the liver.</p>
<p class="indent">Externally, the kidneys are well protected by the ribs and by the muscles of the abdomen and back. Internally, fat deposits surround each kidney, providing protection against jarring. The kidneys and surrounding fat are suspended from the abdominal wall by renal fascia made of connective tissue which holds the kidney in place (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The fibrous connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatics surrounding each kidney are known as the renal capsule. An adrenal gland lies on top of each kidney. The kidneys and adrenals are independent in function, blood supply, and innervation.</p>

<p class="indent">The renal parenchyma is divided into two parts: the cortex and the medulla (see <a href="#ff47-1">Fig.&#x00A0;47-1</a>B). The medulla, which is approximately 5 cm wide, is the inner portion of the kidney. It contains the loops of Henle, the vasa recta, and the collecting ducts of the juxtamedullary nephrons. The collecting ducts from both the juxtamedullary and the cortical nephrons connect to the renal pyramids, which are triangular and are situated with the base facing the concave surface of the kidney and the point (papilla) facing the hilum, or pelvis. Each kidney contains approximately 8 to 18 pyramids. The pyramids drain into minor calyces, which drain into major calyces that open directly into the renal pelvis. The tip of each pyramid is called a papilla and projects into the minor calyx. The renal pelvis is the beginning of the collecting system and is composed of structures that are designed to collect and transport urine. Once the urine leaves the renal pelvis, the composition or amount of urine does not change.</p>
<p class="indent">The cortex, which is approximately 1 cm wide, is located farthest from the center of the kidney and around the outermost edges (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). It contains the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nephrons:&lt;/b&gt; structural and functional units of the kidney responsible for urine formation">nephrons</button></strong> (the structural and functional units of the kidney responsible for urine formation), which are discussed later.</p>
<p class="h7">Blood Supply to the Kidneys</p>
<p class="nonindent">The hilum is the concave portion of the kidney through which the renal artery enters and the ureters and renal vein exit. The kidneys receive 20% to 25% of the total cardiac output, which means that all of the body&#x2019;s blood circulates through the kidneys approximately 12 times per hour (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The renal artery (arising from the abdominal aorta) divides into smaller and smaller vessels, eventually forming the afferent arterioles. Each afferent arteriole branches to form a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;glomerulus:&lt;/b&gt; tuft of capillaries forming part of the nephron through which filtration occurs">glomerulus</button></strong>, which is the tuft of capillaries forming part of the nephron through which filtration occurs. Blood leaves the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and flows back to the inferior vena cava through a network of capillaries and veins.</p>
<p class="h7">Nephrons</p>
<p class="nonindent">Each kidney has one million nephrons that are located within the renal parenchyma and are responsible for the formation of filtrate that will become urine (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The large number of nephrons allows for adequate renal function even if the opposite kidney is damaged or becomes nonfunctional. If the total number of functioning nephrons is less than 20% of normal, kidney replacement therapy needs to be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of nephrons. The cortical nephrons (80% to 85%) are located in the outermost part of the cortex, and the juxtamedullary nephrons (15% to 20%) are located deeper in the cortex (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The juxtamedullary nephrons are distinguished by long loops of Henle and are surrounded by long capillary loops called vasa recta that dip into the medulla of the kidney. The length of the tubular component of the nephron is directly related to its ability to concentrate urine.</p>
<p class="indent">Nephrons are made up of two basic components: a filtering element composed of an enclosed capillary network (the glomerulus) and the attached tubule (see <a href="#ff47-2">Fig.&#x00A0;47-2</a>). The glomerulus is a unique network of capillaries suspended between the afferent and efferent blood vessels, which are enclosed in an epithelial structure called the Bowman capsule<em>.</em> The glomerular membrane is composed of three filtering layers: the capillary endothelium, the basement membrane, and the epithelium. This membrane normally allows filtration of fluid and small molecules yet limits passage of larger molecules, such as blood cells and albumin. Pressure changes and the permeability of the glomerular membrane of the Bowman capsule facilitate the passage of fluids and various substances from the blood vessels, filling the space within the Bowman capsule with this filtered solution.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff47-2">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff47-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff47-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;47-2 &#x2022;</span> Representation of a nephron. Each kidney has about one million nephrons of two types: cortical and juxtamedullary. Cortical nephrons are located in the cortex of the kidney; juxtamedullary nephrons are adjacent to the medulla.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The tubular component of the nephron begins in the Bowman capsule. The filtrate created in the Bowman capsule travels first into the proximal tubule, which is made up of epithelial cells resting on the basement membrane, then the loop of Henle, the distal tubule, and either the cortical or medullary collecting ducts. The structural arrangement of the tubule allows the distal tubule to lie in close proximity to where the afferent and efferent arterioles, respectively, enter and leave the glomerulus. The distal tubular cells located in this area, known as the macula densa, function with the adjacent afferent arteriole and create what is known as the juxtaglomerular apparatus. This is the site of renin production. Renin is a hormone directly involved in the control of arterial blood pressure; it is essential for proper functioning of the glomerulus (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">The tubular component consists of the Bowman capsule, the proximal tubule, the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle, and the cortical and medullary collecting ducts. This portion of the nephron is responsible for making adjustments in the filtrate based on the body&#x2019;s needs. Changes are continually made as the filtrate travels through the tubules until it enters the collecting system and is expelled from the body (see <a href="#ff47-2">Fig.&#x00A0;47-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ureters, Bladder, and Urethra</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The urine formed in the nephrons flows through the renal calyces and then into the ureters, which are long fibromuscular tubes that connect each kidney to the bladder (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Verlander &#x0026; Clapp, 2019</a>). These narrow tubes, each 24 to 30 cm long, originate at the lower portion of the renal pelvis and terminate in the trigone (tissue between the opening of the ureters and urethra) of the bladder wall.</p>
<p class="indent">The lining of the ureters is made up of transitional cell epithelium called urothelium<em>.</em> The urothelium prevents reabsorption of urine. The movement of urine from each renal pelvis through the ureter into the bladder is facilitated by peristaltic contraction of the smooth muscles in the ureter wall. Each ureter has three narrow areas that are prone to obstruction by renal calculi (kidney stones) or stricture. These three areas include the ureteropelvic junction, the ureteral segment near the sacroiliac junction, and the ureterovesical junction. Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction is the most serious because of its close proximity to the kidney and the risk of associated kidney dysfunction.</p>
<p class="indent">The urinary bladder is a distensible muscular sac located just behind the pubic bone (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The usual capacity of the adult bladder is 400 to 500 mL, but it can distend to hold a larger volume. The bladder is characterized by its central, hollow area, called the vesicle, which has two inlets (the ureters) and one outlet (the urethra). The area surrounding the bladder neck is called the ureterovesical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1537" title="1537"></span>junction<em>.</em> The angling of the ureterovesical junction is the primary means of providing antegrade, or downward, movement of urine, also referred to as efflux of urine. This angling prevents vesicoureteral reflux (retrograde, or backward, movement of urine) from the bladder, up the ureter, toward the kidney.</p>
<p class="indent">The wall of the bladder contains four layers. The outermost layer is the adventitia, which is made up of connective tissue. Immediately beneath the adventitia is a smooth muscle layer known as the detrusor. Beneath the detrusor is a submucosal layer of loose connective tissue that serves as an interface between the detrusor and the innermost layer, a mucosal lining. The inner layer contains specialized transitional cell epithelium, a membrane that is impermeable to water and prevents reabsorption of urine stored in the bladder. The bladder neck contains bundles of involuntary smooth muscle that form a portion of the urethral sphincter known as the internal sphincter. An important portion of the sphincter mechanism that helps maintain continence is the external urinary sphincter at the anterior urethra, which is the segment most distal from the bladder (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). During <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;micturition:&lt;/b&gt; urination or voiding">micturition</button></strong> (voiding or urination), increased intravesical pressure keeps the ureterovesical junction closed and urine within the ureters. As soon as micturition is completed, intravesical pressure returns to its normal low baseline value, allowing efflux of urine to resume. Therefore, the only time that the bladder is completely empty is in the last seconds of micturition, before efflux of urine resumes.</p>
<p class="indent">The urethra arises from the base of the bladder: In the male, it passes through the penis; in the female, it opens just anterior to the vagina. In the male, the prostate gland, which lies just below the bladder neck, surrounds the urethra posteriorly and laterally.</p>

<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be8744db7710" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Renal Function</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Understanding the physiology of the kidney and urinary systems includes comprehending urine formation, antidiuretic hormone, osmolarity and osmolality; the regulation of water excretion, electrolyte excretion, and acid&#x2013;base balance; autoregulation of blood pressure, renal clearance, regulation of red blood cell (RBC) production, vitamin D synthesis, secretion of prostaglandins and other substances, excretion of waste products, urine storage as well as bladder emptying.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Urine Formation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The healthy human body is composed of approximately 60% water. Water balance is regulated by the kidneys and results in the formation of urine. Urine is formed in the nephrons through a complex three-step process: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion (see <a href="#ff47-3">Fig.&#x00A0;47-3</a>). Each nephron functions independently from other nephrons because each has its own blood supply (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The various substances normally filtered by the glomerulus, reabsorbed by the tubules, and excreted in the urine include sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, potassium, glucose, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Within the tubule, some of these substances are selectively reabsorbed into the blood. Others are secreted from the blood into the filtrate as it travels down the tubule.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff47-3">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff47-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff47-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;47-3 &#x2022;</span> Urine is formed in the nephrons in a three-step process: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. Water, electrolytes, and other substances, such as glucose and creatinine, are filtered by the glomerulus; varying amounts of these substances are reabsorbed in the renal tubule or excreted in the urine. Approximate normal volumes of these substances during the steps of urine formation are shown at the top. Wide variations may occur in these values depending on diet.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Amino acids and glucose are usually filtered at the level of the glomerulus and reabsorbed so that neither is excreted in the urine. Normally, glucose does not appear in the urine. However, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;glycosuria:&lt;/b&gt; excretion of glucose in the urine">glycosuria</button></strong> (excretion of glucose in the urine) occurs if the amount of glucose in the blood and glomerular filtrate exceeds the amount that the tubules are able to reabsorb. Renal glycosuria can occur on its own as a benign condition. It also occurs in poorly controlled diabetes&#x2014;the most common condition that causes the blood glucose level to exceed the kidney&#x2019;s reabsorption capacity.</p>
<p class="indent">Protein molecules also are not usually found in the urine; however, low-molecular-weight proteins (globulins and albumin) may periodically be excreted in small amounts. Protein in the urine is referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;proteinuria:&lt;/b&gt; protein in the urine">proteinuria</button></strong> (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Glomerular Filtration</p>
<p class="nonindent">The normal blood flow through the kidneys is between 1000 and 1300 mL/min (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). As blood flows into the glomerulus from an afferent arteriole, filtration occurs. The filtered fluid, also known as filtrate or ultrafiltrate, then enters the renal tubules. Under normal conditions, about 20% of the blood passing through the glomeruli is filtered into the nephron, amounting to about 180 L/day of filtrate (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The filtrate normally consists of water, electrolytes, and other small molecules, because water and small molecules are allowed to pass, whereas larger molecules stay in the bloodstream. As blood enters the glomerulus from the afferent arteriole, filtration depends on adequate blood flow that maintains a consistent pressure through the glomerulus called hydrostatic pressure. Many factors can alter this blood flow and pressure, including hypotension, decreased oncotic pressure in the blood, and increased pressure in the renal tubules from an obstruction (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1537</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1538" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1538">p. 1538</span></div>
<p class="h7">Tubular Reabsorption and Tubular Secretion</p>
<p class="nonindent">The second and third steps of urine formation occur in the renal tubules. In tubular reabsorption, a substance moves from the filtrate back into the peritubular capillaries or vasa recta. In tubular secretion, a substance moves from the peritubular capillaries or vasa recta into tubular filtrate. Of the 180 L (45 gallons) of filtrate that the kidneys produce each day, 99% is reabsorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in the formation of 1 to 2 L of urine each day. Although most reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule, reabsorption occurs along the entire tubule. Reabsorption and secretion in the tubule frequently involve passive and active transport and may require the use of energy. Tubular secretion occurs when substances move from the peritubular capillary blood plasma (blood) into the tubular lumen (filtrate). Tubular secretion helps with the elimination of potassium, hydrogen ions, ammonia, uric acid, some drugs, and other waste products (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Filtrate becomes concentrated in the distal tubule and collecting ducts under hormonal influence and becomes urine, which then enters the renal pelvis. In the absence of tubular reabsorption, volume depletion would rapidly occur.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antidiuretic Hormone</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</strong>, also known as vasopressin, is a hormone that is secreted by the posterior portion of the pituitary gland in response to changes in osmolality of the blood. With decreased water intake, blood osmolality tends to increase, stimulating ADH release. ADH then acts on the kidney, increasing reabsorption of water and thereby returning the osmolality of the blood to normal. With excess water intake, the secretion of ADH by the pituitary is suppressed; therefore, less water is reabsorbed by the kidney tubule, leading to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diuresis:&lt;/b&gt; increased urine volume">diuresis</button></strong> (increased urine volume).</p>
<p class="indent">A dilute urine with a fixed <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;specific gravity:&lt;/b&gt; expression of the degree of concentration of the urine">specific gravity</button></strong> (about 1.010) or fixed osmolality (about 300 mOsm/L) indicates an inability to concentrate and dilute the urine, which is a common early sign of kidney disease (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Osmolarity and Osmolality</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Osmolarity refers to the ratio of solute to water. The regulation of salt and water is paramount for control of the extracellular volume and both serum and urine osmolarity. Controlling either the amount of water or the amount of solute can change osmolarity. Osmolarity and ionic composition are maintained by the body within very narrow limits. As little as a 1% to 2% change in the serum osmolarity can cause a conscious desire to drink and conservation of water by the kidneys (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The degree of dilution or concentration of the urine is also measured in terms of osmolality (the number of osmoles [the standard unit of osmotic pressure] dissolved per kilogram of solution). The filtrate in the glomerular capillary normally has the same osmolality as the blood&#x2014;280 to 300 mOsm/kg. Serum and urine osmolality and osmolarity are discussed in more detail in <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regulation of Water Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Regulation of the amount of water excreted is an important function of the kidney. With high fluid intake, a large volume of dilute urine is excreted. Conversely, with a low fluid intake, a small volume of concentrated urine is excreted. A person normally ingests about 1300 mL of oral liquids and 1000 mL of water in food per day. Of the fluid ingested, approximately 800 mL is lost through the skin and lungs and 200 mL through feces (called insensible loss). It is important to consider all fluid gained and lost when evaluating total fluid status. Daily weight measurements are a reliable means of determining overall fluid status. One pound (1 lb) equals approximately 500 mL, so a weight change of as little as 1 lb could suggest an overall fluid gain or loss of 500 mL (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regulation of Electrolyte Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the kidneys are functioning normally, the volume of electrolytes excreted per day is equal to the amount ingested. For example, the average American daily diet contains 6 to 15 g each of sodium chloride (salt) and 8 g potassium chloride, and approximately the same amounts are excreted in the urine.</p>
<p class="indent">The regulation of sodium volume excreted depends on <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aldosterone:&lt;/b&gt; hormone synthesized and released by the adrenal cortex; causes the kidneys to reabsorb sodium">aldosterone</button></strong>, a hormone synthesized and released by the adrenal cortex. With increased aldosterone in the blood, less sodium is excreted in the urine, because aldosterone fosters renal reabsorption of sodium. Release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex is largely under the control of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II levels are in turn controlled by renin, an enzyme that is released from specialized cells in the kidneys (see <a href="#ff47-4">Fig.&#x00A0;47-4</a>). This complex system is activated when pressure in the renal arterioles falls below normal levels, as occurs with shock, dehydration, or decreased sodium chloride delivery to the tubules. Activation of this system increases the retention of water and expansion of the intravascular fluid volume, thereby maintaining enough pressure within the glomerulus to ensure adequate filtration.</p>
<p class="indent">The regulation of serum sodium and potassium is discussed in detail in <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Regulation of Acid&#x2013;Base Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The normal serum pH is about 7.35 to 7.45 and must be maintained within this narrow range for optimal physiologic function (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The kidney performs major functions to assist in this balance. One function is to reabsorb and return to the body&#x2019;s circulation any bicarbonate from the urinary filtrate; other functions are to excrete or reabsorb acid, synthesize ammonia, and excrete ammonium chloride (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Because bicarbonate is a small ion, it is freely filtered at the glomerulus. The renal tubules actively reabsorb most of the bicarbonate in the urinary filtrate. To replace any lost bicarbonate, the renal tubular cells generate new bicarbonate through a variety of chemical reactions. This newly generated bicarbonate is then reabsorbed by the tubules and returned to the body.</p>
<p class="indent">The body&#x2019;s acid production is the result of catabolism, or breakdown, of proteins, which produces acid compounds, particularly phosphoric and sulfuric acids. The normal daily diet also includes a certain amount of acid materials. Unlike carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), phosphoric and sulfuric acids cannot be eliminated by the lungs. Because accumulation of these acids in the blood lowers pH (making the blood more acidic) and inhibits cell function, they must be excreted in the urine. However, if the hydrogen ions are low, they will be reabsorbed. A person with normal kidney function excretes about 70 mEq of acid each day. The kidney is able to excrete some of this acid directly into the urine until the urine pH reaches 4.5, which is 1000 times more acidic than blood (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">However, more acid usually needs to be eliminated from the body than can be secreted directly as free acid in the urine. These excess acids are bound to chemical buffers so that they can be excreted in the urine. Two important chemical buffers are phosphate ions and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). When buffered with acid, ammonia becomes ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>). Phosphate is present in the glomerular filtrate, and ammonia is produced by the cells of the renal tubules and secreted into the tubular fluid. Through the buffering process, the kidney is able to excrete large quantities of acid in a bound form without further lowering the pH of the urine.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Autoregulation of Blood Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Regulation of blood pressure is an important function of the kidney. Specialized vessels of the kidney, called the vasa recta<em>,</em> constantly monitor blood pressure as blood begins its passage into the kidney. When the vasa recta detect a decrease in blood pressure, specialized juxtaglomerular cells near the afferent arteriole, distal tubule, and efferent arteriole secrete the hormone renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II&#x2014;the most powerful vasoconstrictor known; angiotensin II causes the blood pressure to increase (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). The adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone in response to stimulation by the pituitary gland, which occurs in response to poor perfusion or increasing serum osmolality. The result is an increase in blood pressure. When the vasa recta recognize the increase in blood pressure, renin secretion stops. Failure of this feedback mechanism is one of the primary causes of hypertension (see <a href="#ff47-4">Fig.&#x00A0;47-4</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Renal Clearance</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;renal clearance:&lt;/b&gt; ability of the kidneys to clear solutes from the plasma">Renal clearance</button></strong> refers to the ability of the kidneys to clear solutes from the plasma. A 24-hour collection of urine is the primary test of renal clearance used to evaluate how well the kidney performs this important excretory function. Renal clearance depends on several factors: how quickly the substance is filtered across the glomerulus, how much of the substance is reabsorbed along the tubules, and how much of the substance is secreted into the tubules. It is possible to measure the renal clearance of any substance, but the one measure that is particularly useful is the creatinine clearance.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;creatinine:&lt;/b&gt; endogenous waste product of muscle energy metabolism">Creatinine</button></strong> is an endogenous waste product of skeletal muscle that is filtered at the glomerulus, passed through the tubules with minimal change, and excreted in the urine. Hence, creatinine clearance is a good measure of the <strong>glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</strong>, the amount of plasma filtered through the glomeruli per unit of time. To calculate creatinine clearance, a 24-hour urine specimen is collected. Midway through the collection, the serum creatinine level is measured. The following formula is then used to calculate the creatinine clearance:</p>

<p class="indent">The adult glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can vary from a normal of approximately 125 mL/min (1.67 to 2 mL/s) to a high of 200 mL/min (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). Creatinine clearance is the best approximation of renal function. As renal function declines, both creatinine clearance and renal clearance (the ability to excrete solutes) decrease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regulation of Red Blood Cell Production</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the kidneys detect a decrease in the oxygen tension in renal blood flow, because of anemia, arterial hypoxia, or inadequate blood flow, they release erythropoietin. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythropoietin:&lt;/b&gt; hormone produced primarily by the kidney; necessary for erythropoiesis">Erythropoietin</button></strong> is a glycoprotein from the kidney that stimulates the bone marrow to produce RBCs, which carry oxygen throughout the body (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vitamin D Synthesis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys are also responsible for the final conversion of inactive vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Vitamin D is necessary for maintaining normal calcium balance in the body.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Secretion of Prostaglandins and Other Substances</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys also produce prostaglandin E and prostacyclin, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, which have vasoactive effects. These substances help the afferent and efferent arterioles maintain renal blood flow by causing selective vasodilation or vasoconstriction (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Excretion of Waste Products</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys eliminate the body&#x2019;s metabolic waste products. The major waste product of protein metabolism is urea, of which about 25 to 30 g are produced and excreted daily (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). All of this urea must be excreted in the urine; otherwise, it accumulates in body tissues. Other waste products of metabolism that must be excreted are creatinine, phosphates, and sulfates. Uric acid, formed as a waste product of purine metabolism, is also eliminated in the urine. The kidneys serve as the primary mechanism for excreting drug metabolites.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Urine Storage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The bladder is the reservoir for urine. Both filling and emptying of the bladder are mediated by coordinated sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system control mechanisms involving the detrusor muscle and the bladder outlet. Conscious awareness of bladder filling occurs as a result of sympathetic neuronal pathways that travel via the spinal cord to the level of T10 through T12, where peripheral, hypogastric nerve innervation allows for continued bladder filling. As bladder filling continues, stretch receptors in the bladder wall are activated, coupled with the desire to void. This information from the detrusor muscle is relayed back to the cerebral cortex via the parasympathetic pelvic nerves at the levels of S1 through S4 (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). Overall bladder pressure remains low due to the bladder&#x2019;s compliance (ability to expand or collapse) as urine volume changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Bladder compliance is due in part to the smooth muscle lining of the bladder and collagen deposits within the wall of the bladder, as well as to neuronal mechanisms that inhibit the detrusor muscle from contracting (specifically, adrenergic receptors that mediate relaxation). To maintain adequate kidney filtration rates, bladder pressure during filling must remain lower than 40 cm water (H<sub>2</sub>O). This low pressure allows the urine to freely leave the renal pelvis and enter the ureters. The sensation of bladder fullness is transmitted to the central nervous system when the bladder has reached about 150 to 200 mL in adults, and an initial desire to void occurs (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). A marked sense of fullness and discomfort with a strong desire to void usually occurs when the bladder reaches its functional capacity of 400 to 500 mL of urine. Neurologic changes to the bladder at the level of the supraspinal nerves, the spinal nerves, or the bladder wall itself can cause abnormally high volumes (up to 2000 mL) of urine to be stored due to a decreased or absent urge to void.</p>
<p class="indent">Under normal circumstances with average fluid intake of approximately 1 to 2 L/day, the bladder should be able to store urine for periods of 2 to 4 hours at a time during the day (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>). At night, the release of vasopressin in response to decreased fluid intake causes a decrease in the production of urine and makes it more concentrated. This phenomenon usually allows the bladder to continue filling for periods of 6 to 8&#x00A0;hours in adolescents and adults, making them able to sleep for longer periods before needing to void. In older adults, decreasing bladder compliance and decreased vasopressin levels often cause <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nocturia:&lt;/b&gt; awakening at night to urinate">nocturia</button></strong> (awakening during the night to urinate).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bladder Emptying</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Micturition normally occurs approximately eight times in a 24-hour period. It is activated via the micturition reflex arc within the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which causes a coordinated sequence of events. Initiation of voiding occurs when the efferent pelvic nerve, which originates in the S1 to S4 area, stimulates the bladder to contract, resulting in complete relaxation of the striated urethral sphincter. This is followed by a decrease in urethral pressure, contraction of the detrusor muscle, opening of the vesical neck and proximal urethra, and flow of urine. This coordinated effort by the parasympathetic system is mediated by muscarinic and, to a lesser extent, cholinergic receptors within the detrusor muscle. The pressure generated in the bladder during micturition is about 20 to 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in females. It is somewhat higher and more variable in males 45 years and older due to the normal hyperplasia of the cells of the middle lobes of the prostate gland, which surround the proximal urethra. Any obstruction of the bladder outlet, such as in advanced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), results in a high voiding pressure. High voiding pressures make it more difficult to start urine flow and maintain it.</p>
<p class="indent">If the spinal pathways from the brain to the urinary system are destroyed (e.g., after a spinal cord injury), reflex contraction of the bladder is maintained, but voluntary control over the process is lost. In both situations, the detrusor muscle can contract and expel urine, but the contractions are generally insufficient to empty the bladder completely, so residual urine (urine left in the bladder after voiding) remains. Normally, residual urine amounts to no more than 50 mL in the middle-age adult and less than 50 to 100 mL in the older adult (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2085"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Upper and lower urinary tract function changes with age. The GFR decreases, starting between 35 and 40 years of age, and a yearly decline of about 1 mL/min continues thereafter. Older adults are more susceptible to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease due to the structural and functional changes in the kidney. Examples include sclerosis of the glomerulus and renal vasculature, decreased blood flow, decreased GFR, altered tubular function, and acid&#x2013;base imbalance. Although renal function usually remains adequate, renal reserve is decreased and may reduce the kidneys&#x2019; ability to respond effectively to drastic or sudden physiologic changes. This steady decrease in glomerular filtration, combined with the use of multiple medications in which metabolites are cleared by the kidneys, puts the older person at higher risk for adverse drug effects and drug&#x2013;drug interactions (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults are more prone to develop hypernatremia and fluid volume deficit, because increasing age is also associated with diminished osmotic stimulation of thirst. Thirst is defined as one&#x2019;s awareness of the desire to drink. The sense of thirst is so protective that hypernatremia almost never occurs in adults younger than 60 years.</p>
<p class="indent">Structural or functional abnormalities that occur with aging may also prevent complete emptying of the bladder. This may be due to decreased bladder wall contractility; secondary to myogenic or neurogenic factors; or related to bladder outlet obstruction, such as in BPH or after prostatectomy. Vaginal and urethral tissues atrophy (become thinner) in aging women due to decreased estrogen levels. This causes decreased blood supply to the urogenital tissues, resulting in urethral and vaginal irritation and urinary incontinence.</p>
<p class="indent">Urinary incontinence is present in 15% to 30% of community-dwelling older adults, 50% of older adults who are institutionalized, and 30% of older adults who are hospitalized (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Many older adults and their families are unaware that urinary incontinence stems from many causes. The nurse needs to inform the patient and family that with appropriate evaluation, urinary incontinence can often be managed at home, and in many cases it can be eliminated. Many treatments are available for urinary incontinence in older adults, including noninvasive, behavioral interventions that the patient or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1541" title="1541"></span>caregiver can carry out. Treatment modalities for urinary incontinence are described in further detail in <a href="c49.xhtml">Chapter 49</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Preparation of the older adult patient for diagnostic tests must be managed carefully to prevent dehydration, which might precipitate kidney disease in a patient with marginal renal function. Limitations in mobility may affect an older patient&#x2019;s ability to void adequately or to consume an adequate volume of fluids. The patient may limit fluid intake to minimize the frequency of voiding or the risk of incontinence.</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt">Providing education about the dangers of an inadequate fluid intake is an important role of the nurse caring for the older patient. The nurse emphasizes the need to drink throughout the day even if the patient does not feel thirsty, because the thirst stimulation is decreased.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Older adults often have incomplete emptying of the bladder and urinary stasis, which may result in urinary tract infection (UTI) or increasing bladder pressure, leading to overflow incontinence, hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis, or chronic kidney disease (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Urologic symptoms can mimic disorders such as appendicitis, peptic ulcer disease, and cholecystitis, which can make diagnosis difficult in older adults due to decreased neurologic innervation (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
