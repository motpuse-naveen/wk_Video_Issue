<h4 class="h4" id="s909">Infective Endocarditis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endothelial surface of the heart. The disease is rare, but it has a high mortality rate; approximately 14% to 22% of patients die during their hospital stay, and up to 40% of patients die within 1 year of diagnosis (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1821">Kaura, Byrne, Fife, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). It usually develops in older adults, or in people with prosthetic heart valves or cardiac devices. Staphylococcal endocarditis infections of valves in the right side of the heart are common among adults who use illicit IV drugs (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1803">Baddour, Wilson, Bayer, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis occurs most often in patients with debilitating disease or indwelling catheters and in patients who are receiving hemodialysis or prolonged IV fluid or antibiotic therapy (<a href="#ct24-6">Chart 24-6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s910">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A deformity or injury of the endocardium leads to accumulation of fibrin and platelets (clot formation) on the endocardium. Infectious organisms, usually staphylococci or streptococci, invade the clot and endocardial lesion. Infection most frequently results in platelets, fibrin, blood cells, and microorganisms that cluster as vegetations on the endocardium. Vegetations may embolize to other vessels throughout the body. As the clot on the endocardium continues to expand, the infecting organism is covered by new clot and concealed from the body&#x2019;s normal defenses. Infection may erode through the endocardium into underlying structures (e.g., valve leaflets), causing tears or other deformities of valve leaflets, dehiscence of prosthetic valves, deformity of chordae tendineae, or mural abscesses.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s911">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Onset of infective endocarditis usually is insidious. Signs and symptoms develop from toxic effects of the infection, destruction of heart valves, and embolization of fragments of vegetative growths on the endocardium. Primary presenting symptoms of infective endocarditis are fever and a heart murmur. Fever may be intermittent or absent, especially in patients who are receiving antibiotics or corticosteroids, in older adults, and in those who have heart failure or kidney injury. A heart murmur may be absent initially but develops in 85% of patients (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Karchmer, 2018</a>). Murmurs that worsen over time may indicate progressive damage and extension of the infectious vegetation (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1803">Baddour et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to fever and heart murmur, clusters of petechiae may be found on the body. Small, painful nodules (Osler nodes) may be present in pads of fingers or toes. Irregular, red or purple, painless flat macules (Janeway lesions) may be present on palms, fingers, hands, soles, and toes. Hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots) caused by emboli may be observed in fundi of the eyes. Splinter hemorrhages (i.e., reddish-brown lines and streaks) may be seen under the proximal half of fingernails and toenails. Petechiae may appear in conjunctiva and mucous membranes.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 785</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page786" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="786">p. 786</span></div>
<p class="indent">Systemic embolization occurs in 22% to 50% of patients. It can occur at any time and may even be a presenting symptom. Up to 65% of emboli target the central nervous system and the majority of those are to the middle cerebral artery, effectively causing an embolic stroke. Metastatic foci of infection can also occur from embolization; for example, patients may develop a splenic abscess that requires splenectomy (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1803">Baddour et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Heart failure is the most frequent complication of infective endocarditis and may result from perforation of a valve leaflet, rupture of chordae, blood flow obstruction due to vegetations, or intracardiac shunts from dehiscence of prosthetic valves. It indicates a poor prognosis with medical therapy alone and is an indication for surgery (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Alpert &#x0026; Klotz, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s912">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although characteristics described previously may indicate infective endocarditis, signs and symptoms may indicate other diseases as well. Vague complaints of malaise, anorexia, weight loss, cough, and back and joint pain may be mistaken for influenza. Virulence of the causative organism usually correlates with the speed and degree of symptom development. A definitive diagnosis is made when a microorganism is found in two separate blood cultures and there is evidence of vegetation on imaging of the heart (e.g., echocardiogram). At least two sets of blood cultures (with each set including one aerobic and one anaerobic culture) drawn from different venipuncture sites over a 24-hour period (each set at least 2 hours apart), should be obtained before administration of any antibiotics (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Karchmer, 2018</a>). Negative blood cultures do not definitely rule out infective endocarditis. Patients may have elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts. In addition, patients may be anemic, have a positive rheumatoid factor, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein.</p>
<p class="indent">Echocardiography may assist in diagnosis by demonstrating a mass on a valve, prosthetic valve, or supporting structures and by identifying vegetations, abscesses, new prosthetic valve dehiscence, or new regurgitation. An echocardiogram may reveal development of heart failure. TEE may provide additional data when transthoracic imaging is nondiagnostic; this method of echocardiography is superior in assessing vegetations and perivalvular complications (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Karchmer, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s913">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Antibiotic prophylaxis had been traditionally recommended in patients at high risk (e.g., those with previous infective endocarditis, prosthetic heart valves, patients with heart transplant and valve regurgitation, some patients with congenital heart disease) before and sometimes after dental procedures that involved manipulation of gingival tissue or periapical area of teeth or perforation of oral mucosa. Antibiotic prophylaxis was also indicated for patients at high risk having procedures which involved the airway, and procedures which involved manipulation of infected tissue (e.g., wound d&#x00E9;bridement). The latest U.S. guidelines assert that prophylaxis in patients at high risk is reasonable but admit that the data are mixed regarding whether prophylaxis really decreases rates of infective endocarditis (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1835">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients at high risk should practice good oral hygiene. Poor dental hygiene can lead to bacteremia, particularly in the setting of a dental procedure. Severity of oral inflammation and infection is a significant factor in the incidence and degree of bacteremia. Regular professional oral care combined with personal oral care may reduce the risk of bacteremia. Recommended ongoing personal oral care includes using a manual or electronic toothbrush, dental floss, and other plaque removing devices (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1835">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Any patient at risk with a fever of more than 7 days&#x2019; duration should report that finding to a primary provider; patients should not self-medicate with antibiotics or stop taking them before the prescribed dosage has been completed (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1835">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Increased vigilance is also required in patients with IV catheters and during invasive procedures. To minimize the risk of infection, nurses must ensure meticulous hand hygiene, site preparation, and aseptic technique during insertion and maintenance procedures. All catheters, tubes, drains, and other devices are removed as soon as they are no longer needed or no longer function.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s914">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objective of treatment is to eradicate invading organisms through adequate doses of an appropriate antibiotic. Antibiotic therapy usually is given intravenously for 2 to 6 weeks. Parenteral therapy is given in doses that produce a high serum concentration for a significant period to ensure eradication of the dormant bacteria within dense vegetations. This therapy is often delivered in the patient&#x2019;s home and is monitored by a home health nurse. Serum levels of the antibiotic and blood cultures are monitored to gauge effectiveness of therapy. If there is insufficient bactericidal activity, increased dosages of the antibiotic are prescribed or a different antibiotic is used. After adequate antibiotic therapy is initiated, the infective organism is usually eliminated. The patient should begin to feel better, regain an appetite, and have less fatigue. During this time, patients require psychosocial support because although they feel well, they may find themselves confined to the hospital or home with restrictive IV therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s915">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical intervention may be required if the patient develops heart failure or an intracardiac abscess, or the patient has recurrent systemic embolizations, or the infection does not respond to medications. Surgical interventions include valve repair and replacement, d&#x00E9;bridement of vegetations, d&#x00E9;bridement and closure of an abscess, and closure of a fistula. Surgical valve replacement greatly improves the prognosis for patients with severe symptoms from damaged heart valves. Most patients who have prosthetic valve endocarditis require repeat valve replacement (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Alpert &#x0026; Klotz, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s916">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s temperature at regular intervals, because the course of fever is one indication of treatment effectiveness. However, febrile reactions also may occur as a result of medication. The nurse administers antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral medication as prescribed and educates the patient to take them as prescribed. Timing of antimicrobial medication administration is critical to maintain therapeutic drug levels. Fever often increases fatigue; rest periods should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page787" title="787"></span>be planned and activities spaced to provide rest between activities. Good infection control and prevention practices include appropriate hand hygiene by both patients and caregivers. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed as antipyretics or to decrease the discomfort of fever. Patients may be more comfortable with a light layer of linens and exposure of their skin to air. They may be cooled with a fan, tepid water baths, or cloth compresses; if shivering or piloerection occurs, these interventions should be discontinued due to increased oxygen consumption and potential to further increase of body temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">Heart sounds are assessed. A new or worsening murmur may indicate dehiscence of a prosthetic valve, rupture of an abscess, or injury to valve leaflets or chordae tendineae (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1803">Baddour et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). The nurse monitors for signs and symptoms of systemic embolization, or, for patients with right-sided heart endocarditis, for signs and symptoms of pulmonary infarction and infiltrates. In addition, the nurse assesses signs and symptoms of organ damage such as stroke, meningitis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, glomerulonephritis, and splenomegaly.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient care is directed toward management of infection. Long-term IV antimicrobial therapy often is necessary; therefore, many patients have peripherally inserted central catheters or other long-term IV access. All invasive lines and wounds must be assessed daily for redness, tenderness, warmth, swelling, drainage, or other signs of infection. The patient and family are educated about activity restrictions, medications, and signs and symptoms of infection. Patients with infective endocarditis are at high risk for another episode of infective endocarditis. If the patient has undergone surgical treatment, the nurse provides postoperative care and instructions (see Chapters 16 and 23).</p>
<p class="indent">As appropriate, the home health nurse supervises and monitors IV antibiotic therapy delivered in the home setting and educates the patient and family about prevention and health promotion. The nurse provides the patient and family with emotional support and facilitates coping strategies during the prolonged course of infection and antibiotic treatment.</p>
