<h4 class="h4" id="s2068">Foot and Leg Problems</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Lower limb amputations in adults with diabetes increased by 50% between 2009 and 2015 compared to prior years (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Virani et al., 2020</a>). Amputations are preventable, provided patients are taught appropriate foot care measures and practice them on a daily basis (ADA, 2020). Complications of diabetes that contribute to the increased risk of foot problems and infections include the following:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Neuropathy:</em> Sensory neuropathy leads to loss of pain and pressure sensation, and autonomic neuropathy leads to increased dryness and fissuring of the skin (secondary to decreased sweating). Motor neuropathy results in muscular atrophy, which may lead to changes in the shape of the foot.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Peripheral vascular disease:</em> Poor circulation of the lower extremities contributes to poor wound healing and the development of gangrene.</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Immunocompromise:</em> Hyperglycemia impairs the ability of specialized leukocytes to destroy bacteria. Therefore, in poorly controlled diabetes, there is a lowered resistance to certain infections.</p>

Because pain is absent, the ulceration may go unnoticed.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The typical sequence of events in the development of a diabetic foot ulceration begins with a soft tissue injury of the foot, formation of a fissure between the toes or in an area of dry skin, or formation of a callus (see Fig.&#x00A0;46-8). Patients with an insensitive foot do not feel injuries, which may be thermal (e.g., from using heating pads, walking barefoot on hot concrete, testing bathwater with the foot), chemical (e.g., burning the foot while using caustic agents on calluses, corns, or bunions), or traumatic (e.g., injuring skin while cutting nails, walking with an undetected foreign object in the shoe, or wearing ill-fitting shoes and socks).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is not in the habit of thoroughly inspecting both feet on a daily basis, the injury or fissure may go unnoticed until a serious infection has developed. Drainage, swelling, redness of the leg (from cellulitis), or gangrene may be the first sign of foot problems that the patient notices. Treatment of foot ulcerations involves keeping the patient off their feet, antibiotics, and d&#x00E9;bridement. In addition, controlling glucose levels, which tend to increase when infections occur, is important for promoting wound healing. When peripheral vascular disease is present, foot ulcerations may not heal because of the decreased ability of oxygen, nutrients, and antibiotics to reach the injured tissue. Amputation (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>) may be necessary to prevent the spread of infection, particularly if it involves the bone (osteomyelitis) (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Foot assessment and foot care instructions are most important when caring for patients who are at high risk for foot infections (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3458">Johnson, Osbourne, Rispoli, et al., 2018</a>). Some of the high-risk characteristics include:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Duration of diabetes more than 5 years</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Age greater than 40 years</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Current smoker and history of smoking</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Decreased peripheral pulses</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Decreased sensation</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2069">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The feet of a patient with diabetes should be examined during every health care visit or at least once per year (more often if there is an increase in risk) by a podiatrist, physician, or nurse (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Johnson et al., 2018</a>). All patients should be assessed for neuropathy and undergo evaluation of neurologic status by an experienced examiner using a monofilament device (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Johnson et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ff46-9">Fig. 46-9</a>). Pressure areas, such as calluses, or thick toenails should be treated by a podiatrist in addition to routine trimming of nails. Blood glucose control is essential for avoiding decreased resistance to infections and for preventing diabetic neuropathy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2070">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse facilitates or conducts a foot assessment at each visit to a health care provider (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Johnson et al., 2018</a>). Educating patients about proper foot care is an essential nursing intervention that can prevent costly and painful complications that result in disability (see <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#ct46-11">Chart 46-11</a>).</p>
