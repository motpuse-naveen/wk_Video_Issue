<p class="nonindent">A fissure is a longitudinal ulcer that may develop in women who are breast-feeding. If the nipple becomes irritated, a painful, raw area may form and become a site of infection. Daily washing with water, massage with breast milk or lanolin, and exposure to air are helpful. Breast-feeding can continue with the use of a nipple shield. However, if the fissure is severe or extremely painful, the woman may be advised to stop breast-feeding. A breast pump can be used until breast-feeding can be resumed. Persistent ulceration requires further diagnosis and therapy. Guidance from a nurse or lactation consultant may be helpful, because nipple irritation can result from improper positioning or poor latching on (i.e., the infant has not grasped the areola fully) during breast-feeding.</p>
