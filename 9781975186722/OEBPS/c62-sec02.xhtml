<h4 class="h4" id="s2990"><img class="m" src="images/icon17a.png" alt=""/> Hemorrhagic Stroke</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hemorrhagic strokes are primarily caused by intracerebral (10%) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (3%) and are caused by bleeding into the brain tissue, the ventricles, or the subarachnoid space (<a href="#bib4384">Norris, 2019</a>). Primary intracerebral hemorrhage from a spontaneous rupture of small vessels accounts for approximately 80% of hemorrhagic strokes and is caused chiefly by uncontrolled hypertension. Subarachnoid hemorrhage results from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm (discussed later in this chapter) (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib4384">Virani et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A common cause of primary intracerebral hemorrhage in the older adult is cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which involves damage caused by the deposit of beta-amyloid protein in the small- and medium-sized blood vessels of the brain. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy makes these blood vessels fragile and prone to bleeding. Secondary intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), trauma, intracranial neoplasms, or certain medications (e.g., anticoagulants, cocaine, or amphetamines). The mortality rate has been reported to be as high as 50% after an intracranial hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib4384">Norris, 2019</a>). Patients who survive the acute phase of care usually have more severe deficits and a longer recovery phase compared to those with ischemic stroke.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2991">Pathophysiology <img class="m" src="images/icon01ca.jpg" alt=""/></h5>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be87562007b5" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Stroke</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke depends on the cause and underlying type of cerebrovascular disorder. Symptoms are produced when a primary hemorrhage, aneurysm, or AVM presses on nearby cranial nerves or brain tissue or, more dramatically, when an aneurysm or AVM ruptures, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the cranial subarachnoid space). Normal brain metabolism is disrupted by the brain&#x2019;s exposure to blood; by an increase in ICP resulting from the sudden entry of blood into the subarachnoid space, which compresses and injures brain tissue; or by secondary ischemia of the brain resulting from the reduced perfusion pressure and vasospasm that frequently accompany subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intracerebral Hemorrhage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An intracerebral hemorrhage, or bleeding into the brain tissue, is most common in patients with hypertension and cerebral atherosclerosis, because degenerative changes from these diseases cause rupture of the blood vessel. An intracerebral hemorrhage may also result from certain types of arterial pathology, trauma, brain tumors, and the use of medications (e.g., anticoagulants, amphetamines, and cocaine).</p>
<p class="indent">Bleeding related to hypertension occurs most commonly in the deeper structures of the brain (basal ganglia and thalamus); it occurs less frequently in the brainstem (mostly the pons) and cerebellum (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Bleeding in the outer cerebral lobes (lobar hemorrhages) in those 75 or older can be related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and is frequently in the frontal and parietal lobes. Occasionally, the bleeding ruptures the wall of the lateral ventricle and causes intraventricular hemorrhage, which is associated with poor outcomes and death (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>)).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intracranial (Cerebral) Aneurysm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An intracranial (cerebral) <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aneurysm:&lt;/b&gt; a weakening or bulge in an arterial wall">aneurysm</button></strong> is a dilation of the walls of a cerebral artery that develops as a result of weakness in the arterial wall. The cause of aneurysms is unknown, although research is ongoing. An aneurysm may be due to atherosclerosis, which results in a defect in the vessel wall with subsequent weakness of the wall; a congenital defect of the vessel wall; hypertensive vascular disease; head trauma; or advancing age.</p>
<p class="indent">Any artery within the brain can be the site of a cerebral aneurysm, but these lesions usually occur at the bifurcations of the large arteries at the circle of Willis (see <a href="#ff62-5">Fig. 62-5</a>). The cerebral arteries most commonly affected by an aneurysm are the internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, posterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery. Multiple cerebral aneurysms are not uncommon.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Arteriovenous Malformations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most AVMs are caused by an abnormality in embryonal development that leads to a tangle of arteries and veins in the brain that lacks a capillary bed (see <a href="#ff62-5">Fig. 62-5</a>). The absence of a capillary bed leads to dilation of the arteries and veins and eventual rupture. AVM is a common cause of hemorrhagic stroke in young people (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A subarachnoid hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the subarachnoid space) may occur as a result of an AVM, intracranial aneurysm, trauma, or hypertension. The most common causes are a leaking aneurysm in the area of the circle of Willis and a congenital AVM of the brain (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2992">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a hemorrhagic stroke can present with a wide variety of neurologic deficits, similar to the patient with ischemic stroke. The conscious patient most commonly reports a severe headache. A comprehensive assessment reveals the extent of the neurologic deficits. Many of the same motor, sensory, cranial nerve, cognitive, and other functions that are disrupted after ischemic stroke are also altered after a hemorrhagic stroke. <a href="c62-sec01.xhtml#tt62-2">Table 62-2</a> reviews the neurologic deficits frequently seen in patients who have had a stroke. <a href="c62-sec01.xhtml#tt62-3">Table 62-3</a> compares the symptoms seen in right hemispheric stroke with those seen in left hemispheric stroke. Other symptoms that may be observed more frequently in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (compared with ischemic stroke) are nausea or vomiting, headache, an early sudden change in level of consciousness (confusion to coma), and possibly seizures.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the neurologic deficits (similar to those of ischemic stroke), the patient with an intracranial aneurysm or AVM may have some unique clinical manifestations. Rupture of an aneurysm or AVM usually produces a sudden, unusually severe headache and often loss of consciousness for a variable period of time. There may be pain and rigidity of the back of the neck (nuchal rigidity) and spine due to meningeal irritation. Visual disturbances (visual loss, diplopia, ptosis) occur if the aneurysm is adjacent to the oculomotor nerve. Tinnitus, dizziness, photophobia (visual intolerance of light), nausea or vomiting, and hemiparesis may also occur.</p>
<p class="indent">At times, an aneurysm or AVM leaks blood, leading to the formation of a clot that seals the site of rupture. In this instance, the patient may show little neurologic deficit. In other cases, severe bleeding occurs, resulting in cerebral damage, followed rapidly by coma and death.</p>
<p class="indent">Prognosis depends on the neurologic condition of the patient, the patient&#x2019;s age, associated diseases, and the extent and location of the hemorrhage or intracranial aneurysm. Subarachnoid hemorrhage from an aneurysm is a catastrophic event with significant morbidity and mortality.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2993">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Any patient with suspected stroke should undergo a CT scan or MRI scan to determine the type of stroke, the size and location of the hematoma, and the presence or absence of ventricular blood and hydrocephalus. Because hemorrhagic stroke is an emergency, CT scan is usually obtained first because it can be done rapidly. Cerebral angiography using the conventional method or a CT angiography confirms the diagnosis of an intracranial aneurysm or AVM. These tests show the location and size of the lesion and provide information about the affected arteries, veins, adjoining vessels, and vascular branches. Lumbar puncture may be performed if there is no evidence of increased ICP, the CT scan results are negative, and subarachnoid hemorrhage must be confirmed. Lumbar puncture in the presence of increased ICP could result in brainstem herniation or rebleeding.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box2049"><img class="m" src="images/icon15le.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for assisting with a lumbar puncture, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">When diagnosing a hemorrhagic stroke in a patient younger than 40 years, some clinicians obtain a toxicology screen for illicit drug use.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2994">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary prevention of hemorrhagic stroke is the best approach and includes managing hypertension and ameliorating other significant risk factors. Control of hypertension can reduce the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Additional risk factors are increased age, male gender, certain ethnicities (Latino, African American, and Japanese) and moderate or excessive alcohol intake (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Stroke risk screenings provide an ideal opportunity to lower hemorrhagic stroke risk by identifying individuals or groups at high risk and educating patients and the community about recognition and prevention.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2995">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Potential complications of hemorrhagic stroke include rebleeding or hematoma expansion; cerebral vasospasm resulting in cerebral ischemia; acute hydrocephalus, which results when free blood obstructs the reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid villi; and seizures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cerebral Hypoxia and Decreased Blood Flow</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate complications of a hemorrhagic stroke include cerebral hypoxia, decreased cerebral blood flow, and extension of the area of injury. Providing adequate oxygenation of blood to the brain minimizes cerebral hypoxia. Brain function depends on delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Administering supplemental oxygen and maintaining the hemoglobin and hematocrit at acceptable levels will assist in maintaining tissue oxygenation.</p>
<p class="indent">Cerebral blood flow depends on the blood pressure, cardiac output, and integrity of cerebral blood vessels. Adequate hydration (IV fluids) must be ensured to reduce blood viscosity and improve cerebral blood flow. Extremes of hypertension or hypotension need to be avoided to prevent changes in cerebral blood flow and the potential for extending the area of injury.</p>
<p class="indent">A seizure can also compromise cerebral blood flow, resulting in further injury to the brain. Observing for seizure activity and initiating appropriate treatment are important components of care after a hemorrhagic stroke.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2049</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2050" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2050">p. 2050</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Vasospasm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The development of cerebral vasospasm (narrowing of the lumen of the involved cranial blood vessel) is a serious complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those who survive the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mechanism responsible for vasospasm is not clear, but it is associated with increasing amounts of blood in the subarachnoid cisterns and cerebral fissures, as visualized by CT scan. Monitoring for vasospasm may be performed through the use of bedside transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or follow-up cerebral angiography (<a href="#bib4356">Connolly, Rabinstein, Carhuapoma, et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib4384">Wilson, Ashcroft, &#x0026; Troiani, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Vasospasm most frequently occurs 7 to 8 days after initial hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4348">American Association of Neuroscience Nurses [AANN], 2018</a>), when the clot undergoes lysis (dissolution), and the chance of rebleeding is increased. It leads to increased vascular resistance, which impedes cerebral blood flow and causes brain ischemia (delayed cerebral ischemia) and infarction. Vasospasm can also occur 3 to 14 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Vasospasm is likely not the only factor that plays a role in the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. The signs and symptoms reflect the areas of the brain involved. Vasospasm is often heralded by a worsening headache, a decrease in level of consciousness (confusion, lethargy, and disorientation), or a new focal neurologic deficit (aphasia, hemiparesis).</p>
<p class="indent">Management of vasospasm remains difficult and controversial. It is believed that early surgery to clip the aneurysm prevents rebleeding and that removal of blood from the basal cisterns around the major cerebral arteries may prevent vasospasm.</p>
<p class="indent">Medication may be effective in the treatment and prevention of vasospasm. Based on the theory that vasospasm is caused by an increased influx of calcium into the cell, medication therapy may be used either to block or antagonize this action, or to prevent or reverse the action of vasospasm if already present. Nimodipine is the most studied calcium channel blocker for prevention of vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Current guidelines recommend that nimodipine be prescribed for all patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4384">Connolly et al., 2012</a>). This is currently the only drug approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="indent">Another therapy for vasospasm and the resulting delayed cerebral ischemia, referred to as triple-H therapy, is aimed at minimizing the deleterious effects of the associated cerebral ischemia and includes (1) fluid volume expanders (hypervolemia), (2) induced arterial hypertension, and (3) hemodilution. However, current research and guidelines now endorse euvolemia to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia and induced arterial hypertension for treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia (<a href="#bib4384">Connolly et al., 2012</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">An increase in ICP can occur after either an ischemic or a hemorrhagic stroke but almost always follows a subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually because of disturbed circulation of CSF caused by blood in the basal cisterns. Neurologic assessments are performed frequently, and if there is evidence of deterioration from increased ICP (due to cerebral edema, herniation, hydrocephalus, or vasospasm), CSF drainage may be instituted by ventricular catheter drainage (<a href="#bib4360">Hemphill, Greenberg, Anderson, et al., 2015</a>). Mannitol may be administered to reduce ICP. When mannitol is used as a long-term measure to control ICP, dehydration and disturbances in electrolyte balance (hyponatremia or hypernatremia; hypokalemia or hyperkalemia) may occur. Mannitol pulls water out of the brain tissue by osmosis and reduces total body water through diuresis. The patient&#x2019;s fluid balance is monitored continuously and is assessed for signs of dehydration and for rebound elevation of ICP. Other interventions may include elevating the head of the bed to 30 to 45&#x00A0;degrees, avoidance of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, sedation, and use of hypertonic saline in a variety of concentrations (e.g., 3%, 7.5%, or 23%) (<a href="#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hypertension</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is the most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage, and its treatment is critical. Specific goals for blood pressure management, which are individualized for each patient, remain controversial. Blood pressure goals may depend on the presence of increased ICP. Guidelines for management of intracerebral hemorrhage recommend early blood pressure lowering (if the systolic blood pressure is between 150 and 220 mm Hg) to a goal systolic of 140 mm Hg, and report that lowering blood pressure can be effective for improving patient outcomes. If systolic blood pressure is above 220 mm Hg, IV continuous infusions of antihypertensive agents may be prescribed (<a href="#bib4384">Hemphill et al., 2015</a>). Nicardipine is one agent that may be used as a continuous IV infusion. Labetalol and hydralazine are other examples of medications that may be given as an IV bolus. During the administration of antihypertensive agents, hemodynamic monitoring is important to detect and avoid a precipitous drop in blood pressure, which can produce brain ischemia. Stool softeners are used to prevent straining, which can elevate the blood pressure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2996">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of medical treatment for hemorrhagic stroke are to allow the brain to recover from the initial insult (bleeding), to prevent or minimize the risk of rebleeding, and to prevent or treat complications. Management may consist of bed rest with sedation to prevent agitation and stress, management of vasospasm, and surgical or medical treatment to prevent rebleeding. If the bleeding is caused by anticoagulation with warfarin, the INR may be corrected with fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrations. Reversing the anticoagulation effect of DOACs requires use of an antidote. Idarucizumab is a medication that was approved for reversing dabigatran and andexanet alfa; it is an antidote for patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban; both are factor Xa inhibitors (<a href="#bib4357">Cordonnier, Demchuk, Ziai, et al., 2018</a>). If seizures occur, they are treated with anti-epileptic drugs such as levetiracetam or phenytoin. Hyperglycemia should also be treated, and hypoglycemia is avoided. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices should be used starting on the first day of the hospital admission to prevent DVT. If the patient is not mobile after 1 to 4 days from the onset of the hemorrhage and there is documentation of the bleeding ceasing, then DVT prevention medications (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin) may be prescribed (<a href="#bib4384">Hemphill et al., 2015</a>). Analgesic agents may be prescribed for head and neck <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2051" title="2051"></span>pain. Fever should be treated with acetaminophen and devices such as cooling blankets. After discharge, most patients will require antihypertensive medications to decrease their risk of another intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In many cases, a primary intracerebral hemorrhage is not treated surgically. However, if the patient is showing signs of worsening neurologic examination, increased ICP, or signs of brainstem compression, then surgical evacuation is recommended for the patient with a cerebellar hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4384">Hemphill et al., 2015</a>). Surgical evacuation is most frequently accomplished via a craniotomy (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>). Minimally invasive surgical techniques have also been investigated.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with an intracranial aneurysm is prepared for surgical intervention as soon as their condition is considered stable. Surgical treatment of the patient with an unruptured aneurysm is an option. The goal of surgery is to prevent bleeding in an unruptured aneurysm or further bleeding in an already ruptured aneurysm. This objective is accomplished by isolating the aneurysm from its circulation or by strengthening the arterial wall. An aneurysm may be excluded from the cerebral circulation by means of a ligature or a clip across its neck. If this is not anatomically possible, the aneurysm can be reinforced by wrapping it with some substance to provide support and induce scarring.</p>
<p class="indent">Advances in technology have led to the introduction of interventional neuroradiology for the treatment of aneurysms. These techniques are now being used more frequently. Endovascular techniques may be used in select patients to occlude the blood flow from the artery that feeds the aneurysm with coils, liquid embolic agents, or other techniques to occlude the aneurysm itself. If the aneurysm is very large or very wide at its neck, a stent-like device made of a very fine mesh may be used to divert the blood flow away from the aneurysm. The determination of which technique should be used is based on many factors (characteristics of the patient and aneurysm) and is made by experienced endovascular specialists (<a href="#bib4384">Connolly et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib4373">Thompson, Brown, Amin-Hanjani, et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative complications are rare but can occur. Potential complications include psychological symptoms (disorientation, amnesia, Korsakoff syndrome), intraoperative embolization or artery rupture, postoperative artery occlusion, fluid and electrolyte disturbances (from dysfunction of the neurohypophyseal system), and gastrointestinal bleeding. Complications post procedurally may also include bleeding, hematoma, vascular complications, allergic reactions, and stroke.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient is closely monitored for neurologic deterioration resulting from recurrent bleeding, increasing ICP, or vasospasm. A neurologic flow record is maintained. The blood pressure, pulse, level of consciousness (an indicator of cerebral perfusion), pupillary responses, and motor function are checked hourly. Respiratory status is monitored, because a reduction in oxygen in areas of the brain with impaired autoregulation increases the chances of a cerebral infarction. Any changes are reported immediately.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Implementing Aneurysm Precautions.</span> Cerebral aneurysm precautions are implemented for the patient with a diagnosis of aneurysm (prior to any intervention) to provide a nonstimulating environment, prevent increases in ICP, and prevent further bleeding. The patient is placed on bed rest in a quiet, nonstressful environment, because activity, pain, and anxiety are thought to elevate the blood pressure, which may increase the risk for bleeding. Visitors may be restricted (AANN, 2018).</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The head of the bed is elevated 30 to 45 degrees to promote venous drainage and decrease ICP. Any activity that suddenly increases the blood pressure or obstructs venous return is avoided. This includes the Valsalva maneuver, straining, forceful sneezing, pushing oneself up in bed, and acute flexion or rotation of the head and neck (which compromises the jugular veins). Stool softeners and mild laxatives are prescribed. Both prevent constipation, which can cause an increase in ICP. Dim lighting is helpful, because photophobia is common. The purpose of aneurysm precautions should be thoroughly explained to both the patient (if possible) and family. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices and unfractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparin are prescribed to decrease the incidence of DVT resulting from immobility. The legs are observed for signs and symptoms of DVT (tenderness, redness, swelling, warmth, and edema), and abnormal findings are reported.</p>

<p class="processppara">Sensory stimulation is kept to a minimum for patients on aneurysm precautions. For patients who are awake, alert, and oriented, an explanation of the restrictions helps reduce the patient&#x2019;s sense of isolation. Reality orientation is provided to help maintain orientation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Keeping the patient well informed of the plan of care provides reassurance and helps minimize anxiety. Appropriate reassurance also helps relieve the patient&#x2019;s fears and anxiety. The family also requires information and support.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ONITORING AND</span> M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> P<span class="small">OTENTIAL</span> C<span class="small">OMPLICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Vasospasm.</span> The patient is assessed for signs of possible vasospasm: intensified headaches, a decrease in level of responsiveness (confusion, disorientation, lethargy), or evidence of aphasia or partial paralysis. These signs may develop several days after surgery or on the initiation of treatment and must be reported immediately. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine should be given for prevention of vasospasm, and fluid volume expanders in the form of triple-H therapy may be prescribed as well (<a href="#bib4384">Connolly et al., 2012</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Seizures.</span> Seizure precautions are maintained for every patient who may be at risk for seizure activity. Should a seizure occur, maintaining the airway and preventing injury are the primary goals. Medication therapy is initiated at this time (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Hydrocephalus.</span> Blood in the subarachnoid space or ventricles impedes the circulation of CSF, resulting in hydrocephalus. A CT scan that indicates dilated ventricles confirms the diagnosis. Hydrocephalus can occur within the first 24 hours (acute) after subarachnoid hemorrhage or several days (subacute) to several weeks (delayed) later. Symptoms vary according to the time of onset and may be nonspecific. Acute hydrocephalus is characterized by sudden onset of stupor or coma and is managed with a ventriculostomy drain to decrease ICP. Symptoms of subacute and delayed hydrocephalus include gradual onset of drowsiness, behavioral changes, and ataxic gait. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is surgically placed to treat chronic hydrocephalus. Changes in patient responsiveness are reported immediately.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Rebleeding.</span> The rate of recurrent hemorrhage is approximately 1% to 5% per patient per year after intracerebral hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4384">Hemphill et al., 2015</a>). Hypertension is the most serious and modifiable risk factor, which shows the importance of appropriate antihypertensive treatment.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Aneurysm rebleeding is the highest during the first 2 to 12&#x00A0;hours after the initial hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4384">Connolly et al., 2012</a>) and is considered a major complication. Symptoms of rebleeding include sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, and neurologic deficit. Rebleeding is confirmed by CT scan. Blood pressure is carefully maintained with medications. The most effective preventive treatment is to secure the aneurysm if the patient is a candidate for surgery or endovascular treatment.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Hyponatremia.</span> After subarachnoid hemorrhage, hyponatremia is found in 30% to 50% of patients (<a href="#bib4384">Wilson et al., 2019</a>). Hyponatremia has been found to be associated with the onset of vasospasm (<a href="#bib4384">Connolly et al., 2012</a>). Laboratory data must be checked frequently, and hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium concentration less than 135 mEq/L) must be identified as early as possible. The patient&#x2019;s primary provider needs to be notified of a low serum sodium level that has persisted for 24 hours or longer. The patient is then evaluated for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or cerebral salt-wasting syndrome. SIADH is described in <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>. Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome occurs when the kidneys are unable to conserve sodium and volume depletion results. The treatment most often is the use of IV hypertonic 3% saline.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient and family are provided with education that will enable them to cooperate with the care and restrictions required during the acute phase of hemorrhagic stroke and to prepare them to return home. Patient and family education includes information about the causes of hemorrhagic stroke and its possible consequences. In addition, the patient and family are informed about the medical treatments that are implemented, including surgical intervention if warranted, and the importance of interventions taken to prevent and detect complications (i.e., aneurysm precautions, close monitoring of the patient). Depending on the presence and severity of neurologic impairment and other complications resulting from the stroke, the patient may be transferred to a rehabilitation unit or center for additional patient and family education about strategies to regain self-care ability. Education addresses the use of assistive devices or modification of the home environment to help the patient live with the disability. Modifications of the home may be required to provide a safe environment.</p>

Referral for home, community-based, or transitional care may be warranted to assess the home environment and the ability of the patient and to ensure that the patient and family are able to manage at home. Home visits provide opportunities to monitor the physical and psychological status of the patient and the ability of the family to cope with any alterations in the patient&#x2019;s status.

<p class="nonindent">Each year, an estimated 15,000 veterans are hospitalized with a stroke-related diagnosis; of these, between 15% and 30% have severe impairment while 40% have some type of functional limitation (<a href="#bib4375">Veteran&#x2019;s Administration/Department of Defense, The Management of Stroke Rehabilitation Work Group, 2019</a>). Care for the veteran who has had a stroke takes place in a variety of settings. There are 33 primary stroke centers, 32 limited hours stroke centers, 43 supporting stroke facilities, and 45 acute rehabilitation facilities within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Nurses who work with patients who have had strokes should be aware of these systems as they may need to assist the veteran and their family to facilitate transfer or referral to facilities that can best meet their health care needs.</p>
