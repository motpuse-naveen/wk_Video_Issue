<h4 class="h4" id="s2800">Ocular Trauma</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Ocular trauma is a leading cause of blindness among children and young adults, especially male trauma victims (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4176">Buc&#x00B4;an, Matas, Lovric&#x00B4;, et al., 2017</a>). Ocular trauma occurs with occupational injuries (e.g., construction industry), contact sports, weapons (e.g., air guns, BB guns), assaults, motor vehicle crashes (e.g., broken windshields), and explosions (e.g., blast fragments).</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of ocular trauma in which the first response is critical: chemical burn and foreign object in the eye. With a chemical burn, the eye should be immediately irrigated with tap water or normal saline. With a foreign body, no attempt should be made to remove the foreign object. The object should be protected from jarring or movement to prevent further ocular damage. No pressure or patch should be applied to the affected eye. All other traumatic eye injuries should be protected using a patch or shield if available or a stiff paper cup until medical treatment can be obtained (see <a href="#ff58-14">Fig. 58-14</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2801">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A thorough history is obtained, particularly assessing the patient&#x2019;s ocular history, such as pre-injury vision in the affected eye or past ocular surgery. Details related to the injury that help in the diagnosis and assessment of the need for further tests include the nature of the ocular injury (i.e., blunt or penetrating trauma); the type of activity that caused the injury to determine the nature of the force striking the eye; and whether onset of vision loss was sudden, slow, or progressive. For chemical eye burns, the chemical agent must be identified and tested for pH if the agent is available. The corneal surface is examined for foreign bodies, wounds, and abrasions, after which the other external structures of the eye are examined. Pupil size, shape, and light reaction of the pupil of the affected eye are compared with the other eye. Ocular motility (ability of the eyes to move synchronously up, down, right, and left) is also assessed.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2802">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Splash Injuries</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Splash injuries are irrigated with normal saline solution before further evaluation occurs. In cases of a ruptured globe, cycloplegic agents (agents that paralyze the ciliary muscle) or topical antibiotics must be deferred because of potential toxicity to exposed intraocular tissues. Further manipulation of the eye must be avoided until the patient is under general anesthesia. Parenteral, broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Tetanus antitoxin is given, if indicated, as well as analgesic agents. (Tetanus prophylaxis is recommended for full-thickness ocular and skin wounds.) Any topical ophthalmic medication (e.g., anesthetic, dyes) must be sterile.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Foreign Bodies and Corneal Abrasions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After removal of a foreign body from the surface of the eye, an antibiotic ointment is applied and the eye is patched. The eye is examined daily for evidence of infection until the wound is completely healed.</p>
<p class="indent">Contact lens wear is a common cause of corneal abrasion. The patient experiences severe pain and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;photophobia:&lt;/b&gt; ocular pain on exposure to light">photophobia</button></strong> (ocular pain on exposure to light). Corneal epithelial defects are treated with antibiotic ointment and, in some instances, a pressure patch to immobilize the eyelids. Topical anesthetic eye drops must not be given to the patient to take home for repeated use after corneal injury because their effects mask further damage, delay healing, and can lead to corneal scarring.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Penetrating Injuries and Contusions of the Eyeball</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sharp penetrating injury or blunt contusion force can rupture the eyeball. When the globe, cornea, and sclera rupture, rapid decompression or herniation of the orbital contents into adjacent sinuses can occur. Blunt traumatic injuries (with an increased incidence of retinal detachment, intraocular tissue avulsion, and herniation) have a worse prognosis than penetrating injuries. Most penetrating injuries result in marked loss of vision with the following signs: hemorrhagic <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chemosis:&lt;/b&gt; edema of the conjunctiva">chemosis</button></strong> (edema of the conjunctiva), conjunctival laceration, shallow anterior chamber with or without an eccentrically placed pupil, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hyphema:&lt;/b&gt; blood in the anterior chamber">hyphema</button></strong> (blood within the anterior chamber), or vitreous hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="indent">Hyphema is caused by contusion forces that tear the vessels of the iris and damage the anterior chamber angle. Preventing rebleeding and prolonged increased IOP are the goals of treatment for hyphema. In severe cases, the patient is hospitalized with moderate activity restriction. An eye shield is applied. Topical corticosteroids are prescribed to reduce inflammation. An antifibrinolytic agent (aminocaproic acid) stabilizes clot formation at the site of hemorrhage. Aspirin is contraindicated. A ruptured globe and severe injuries with intraocular hemorrhage require surgical intervention. Vitrectomy is performed for traumatic retinal detachments (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Park et al., 2018</a>). Primary <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;enucleation:&lt;/b&gt; removal of the eyeball and part of the optic nerve">enucleation</button></strong> (complete removal of the eyeball and part of the optic nerve) is considered only if the globe is irreparable and has no light perception. It is a general rule that enucleation is performed within 2 weeks of the initial injury (in an eye that has no useful vision after sustaining penetrating injury) to prevent the risk of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sympathetic ophthalmia:&lt;/b&gt; an inflammatory condition created in the fellow eye by the affected eye">sympathetic ophthalmia</button></strong> (an inflammation created in the uninjured eye by the affected eye that can result in blindness of the uninjured eye).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intraocular Foreign Bodies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A patient who complains of blurred vision and discomfort should be questioned carefully about recent injuries and exposures. Patients may be injured in a number of different situations and experience an intraocular foreign body (IOFB). Precipitating circumstances can include working in construction, striking metal against metal, being involved in a motor vehicle crash with facial injury, a gunshot wound, grinding-wheel work, and explosions.</p>
<p class="indent">IOFB is diagnosed and localized by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy, as well as CT or ultrasonography scanning. MRI is contraindicated because most foreign bodies are metallic and magnetic. It is important to determine the composition, size, and location of the IOFB and affected eye structures. Every effort should be made to identify the type of IOFB and whether it is magnetic. Iron, steel, copper, and vegetable matter may cause intense inflammatory reactions. The incidence of endophthalmitis is high. Surgical excision of the foreign body depends on its location and composition and associated ocular injuries. Specially designed IOFB forceps and magnets are used to grasp and remove the foreign body. Any damaged area of the retina is treated to prevent retinal detachment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ocular Burns</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Alkali, acid, and other chemically active organic substances, such as Mace and tear gas, cause chemical burns. Alkali burns (e.g., lye, ammonia) result in the most severe injury because they penetrate the ocular tissues rapidly and continue to cause long-term damage. Increased IOP also occurs. Acids (e.g., bleach, car batteries, refrigerant) generally cause less damage because the precipitated necrotic tissue proteins form a barrier to further penetration and damage. Chemical burns may appear as superficial punctate keratopathy (i.e., spotty damage to the cornea), subconjunctival hemorrhage, or complete marbleizing of the cornea.</p>
<p class="indent">In treating chemical burns, every minute counts. Immediate irrigation with tap water should be started on site before transport of the patient to an emergency department. A brief history and examination are performed. Critical information, if available, is the name of the substance that went into the eye (the actual container is best). Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) should be accessed for reference (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>). The corneal surfaces and conjunctival fornices are immediately and copiously irrigated with normal saline or any neutral solution. A local anesthetic is instilled, and a lid speculum is applied to overcome blepharospasm (i.e., spasms of the eyelid muscles that result in closure of the lids). Particulate matter must be removed from the fornices using moistened, cotton-tipped applicators and minimal pressure on the globe. Irrigation continues until the conjunctival pH normalizes (between 7.3 and 7.6). The pH of the corneal surface is checked by placing a pH paper strip in the fornix. Antibiotic agents are instilled, and the eye usually is patched.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of intermediate treatment is to prevent tissue ulceration and promote re-epithelialization of the cornea. Intense lubrication using artificial tears without preservatives (to avoid allergic reactions) is essential. Patching or therapeutic soft lenses may also be used to promote corneal healing, and the patient is closely monitored. Prognosis depends on the type of injury and adequacy of the irrigation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1926" title="1926"></span>immediately after exposure. Long-term treatment consists of two phases: restoration of the ocular surface through grafting procedures and surgical restoration of corneal integrity and optical clarity.</p>
<p class="indent">Thermal injury is caused by exposure to a hot object (e.g., curling iron, tobacco, ash), whereas photochemical injury results from ultraviolet irradiation or infrared exposure (e.g., exposure to the reflections from snow, sun gazing, viewing an eclipse of the sun without an adequate filter). These injuries can cause corneal epithelial defect, corneal opacity, conjunctival chemosis and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;injection:&lt;/b&gt; congestion of blood vessels">injection</button></strong> (congestion of blood vessels), and burns of the eyelids and periocular region. Antibiotic agents and a patch for 24 hours constitute the treatment of mild injuries.</p>
