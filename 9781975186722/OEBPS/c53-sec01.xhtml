<h4 class="h4a" id="s2493">ASSESSMENT OF THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</h4>
<h4 class="h4a" id="s2494"><strong>Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">In the male, several organs serve as parts of both the urinary tract and the reproductive system. Disorders in the male reproductive organs may interfere with the functions of one or both of these systems. As a result, diseases of the male reproductive system are usually treated by a urologist. The structures in the male reproductive system include the (1) external male genitalia, consisting of the testes, epididymis, scrotum, and penis, and the (2) internal male genitalia, consisting of the vas deferens (ductus deferens), ejaculatory duct, and prostatic and membranous sections of the urethra, seminal vesicles, and certain accessory glands, such as the prostate gland and Cowper glands (bulbourethral glands) (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-1">Fig.&#x00A0;53-1</a></span>).</p>
<p class="indent">The testes have a dual function: <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spermatogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; production of sperm in the testes">spermatogenesis</button></strong> (production of sperm) and secretion of the male sex hormone <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;testosterone:&lt;/b&gt; male sex hormone secreted by the testes; induces and preserves the male sex characteristics">testosterone</button></strong>, which induces and preserves the male sex characteristics. The testes are formed in the embryo, within the abdominal cavity near the kidney. During the last month of fetal life, they descend posterior to the peritoneum and pierce the abdominal wall in the groin. Later, they progress along the inguinal canal into the scrotal sac. In this descent, they are accompanied by blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves, and ducts, which support the tissue and make up the spermatic cord. This cord extends from the internal inguinal ring through the abdominal wall and the inguinal canal to the scrotum. As the testes descend into the scrotum in the final 2 to 3 months of gestation, a tubular extension of peritoneum accompanies them (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Rhoades &#x0026; Bell, 2017</a>). Normally, this tissue is obliterated during fetal development; only the tunica vaginalis, which covers the testes, remains. If the peritoneal process remains open into the abdominal cavity, a potential sac remains into which abdominal contents may enter to form an indirect inguinal hernia.</p>
<p class="indent">The testes, or ovoid sex glands, are encased in the scrotum, which keeps them at a slightly lower temperature than the rest of the body to facilitate spermatogenesis (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Rhoades &#x0026; Bell, 2017</a>). The testes consist of numerous seminiferous tubules in which the spermatozoa form. Collecting tubules transmit the spermatozoa into the epididymis, a hoodlike structure lying on the testes and containing winding ducts that lead into the vas deferens. This firm, tubular structure passes upward through the inguinal canal to enter the abdominal cavity behind the peritoneum. It then extends downward toward the base of the bladder. An outpouching from this structure is the seminal vesicle, which acts as a reservoir for testicular secretions. The tract is continued as the ejaculatory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1745" title="1745"></span>duct, which passes through the prostate gland to enter the urethra. Testicular secretions take this pathway when they exit the penis during ejaculation.</p>

<p class="indent">The penis is the organ for both copulation and urination. It consists of the glans penis, the body, and the root. The glans penis is the soft, rounded portion at the distal end of the penis. The urethra (the tube that carries urine) opens at the tip of the glans. The glans is naturally covered by elongated penile skin&#x2014;the foreskin&#x2014;which may be retracted to expose the glans. However, many men as newborns have undergone circumcision, which is a procedure to remove the foreskin. The body of the penis is composed of erectile tissues containing numerous blood vessels that become dilated, leading to an erection during sexual excitement. The urethra, which passes through the penis, extends from the bladder through the prostate to the distal end of the penis.</p>
<p class="indent">The prostate gland, lying just below the neck of the bladder, is composed of four zones and four lobes. It surrounds the urethra and is traversed by the ejaculatory duct, a continuation of the vas deferens. This gland produces a secretion that is chemically and physiologically suitable to the needs of the spermatozoa in their passage from the testes. Cowper glands lie below the prostate, within the posterior aspect of the urethra. This gland empties its secretions into the urethra during ejaculation, providing lubrication.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2495"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As men age, the prostate gland enlarges; prostate secretion decreases; the scrotum hangs lower; the testes decrease in weight, atrophy, and become softer; and pubic hair becomes sparser and stiffer. Changes in gonadal function include a decline in plasma testosterone levels and reduced production of progesterone (see <span class="chart"><a href="c53-sec02.xhtml#tt53-1">Table&#x00A0;53-1</a></span>). Libido and potency often decrease in as many as two thirds of men older than 70 years (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Tabloski, 2019</a>). Vascular problems cause about half of the cases of erectile dysfunction in men older than 50 years.</p>
<p class="indent">However, male reproductive capability is maintained with advancing age. Although degenerative changes occur in the seminiferous tubules and sperm production decreases, spermatogenesis continues, allowing men to produce viable sperm throughout their lives (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3834">McCance, Huether, Braskers, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Male hypogonadism (decreased function of the testes) starts gradually at approximately 50 years of age, resulting in decreased testosterone production. The older man notices that the sexual response slows, erection takes longer, full erections may not be attained, ejaculation takes longer to occur, and control or resolution may occur without orgasm. Sexual function can be affected by psychological problems, illnesses, and medications (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Sikka &#x0026; Hellstrom, 2017</a>). In general, the entire sexual act takes longer. Sexual activity is closely correlated with the man&#x2019;s sexual activity in his earlier years; if he was more active than average as a young man, he will most likely continue to be more active than average in his later years.</p>
<p class="indent">Men older than 50 years are at increased risk for genitourinary tract cancers, including those of the kidney, bladder, prostate, and penis. The digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and urinalysis, which screens for hematuria, may uncover a higher percentage of malignancies at earlier stages and lead to lower treatment-associated morbidity as well as a lower mortality.</p>
<p class="indent">Urinary incontinence occurs in one fifth of community-dwelling older men and rises to nearly 50% in men in long-term care settings (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Tabloski, 2019</a>). Older adults admitted to acute care settings should be screened for this problem. Urinary incontinence may have many causes, including medications, neurologic disease, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Incontinence may also be linked to erectile dysfunction when there is damage to the neural pathways that initiate an erection (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3881">Rantell, Apostolidis, Anding, et al., 2017</a>). Diagnostic tests are performed to exclude reversible causes. New-onset urinary incontinence is a nursing priority that requires evaluation.</p>
