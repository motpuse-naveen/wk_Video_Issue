<h4 class="h4" id="s2258">Orthotopic Neobladder</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An orthotopic neobladder reconstruction is performed in approximately 38% of patients who have undergone cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Shi et al., 2018</a>). During this surgery, a new bladder is constructed from segments of the intestine (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>) (see <a href="#ff49-8">Fig.&#x00A0;49-8</a>). There are several advantages of this type of urinary diversion compared to the more common ileal conduit including that the newly reconstructed bladder is attached to the urethra, achieving functional and anatomical restoration (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Shi et al., 2018</a>). The new voiding system is similar to the natural preoperative state, and researchers have reported a higher quality of life in patients who undergo this procedure compared to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1631" title="1631"></span>patients with an ileal conduit (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Shi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Yang et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">There are several disadvantages to orthotopic neobladder reconstruction as well. Not all patients are suitable for the surgery (see later discussion). Other disadvantages include the need for bladder retraining and the potential for incontinence postoperatively (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). The intestine used to create the neobladder does not have the stimulation to contract that the natural bladder had, leading to the need for bladder retraining. Even with bladder retraining, only 80% of patients achieve full continence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Shi et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2259">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the preoperative period, the patient undergoes careful evaluation as not all patients are suitable for this surgery. Major contraindications include renal and liver impairment, intestinal disease, and cancer in specific parts of the bladder (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). See <a href="#ct49-14">Chart&#x00A0;49-14</a> for a list of patient characteristics that contraindicate performing an orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. However, this surgery is a viable alternative to an ileal conduit in the patient who is free of these contraindications, does not want a stoma, and is willing to adhere to the neobladder training (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When the surgery is performed, the surgeon constructs a sphere-shaped neobladder, also referred to as a pouch, from intestinal segments to replace the bladder that has been removed. The most common intestinal segments used are the ileum, colon, and sigmoid portions of the intestine (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2260">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">This is a more complex surgery than the creation of an ileal conduit; therefore, there is a higher risk of several complications including fluid and electrolyte imbalances, postoperative ileus, and incontinence. The patient is at risk for metabolic acidosis as the wall of the neobladder is now made of intestinal mucosa that is more permeable to urinary electrolytes compared to the original bladder wall (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). The shift in electrolytes also leads to the urine being more concentrated, which can lead to dehydration (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). Patients are at higher risk of postoperative ileus at the fifth postoperative day and later compared to those undergoing an ileal conduit procedure (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2261">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the preoperative period, the nurse assists in the assessment of the suitability of the patient to undergo an orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. In conjunction with the surgeon the nurse assesses for potential patient contraindications to the surgery (see <a href="#ct49-14">Chart&#x00A0;49-14</a>). It is important to begin education about what the patient can expect in the postoperative period, especially the time and effort that will be needed for bladder retraining. The patient needs to clearly understand the risk for incontinence both in the short term postoperatively and possibly on a long-term basis.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative nursing care of the patient with an orthotopic neobladder reconstruction is similar to nursing care of the patient with an ileal conduit. In addition to the usual postoperative care (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>), the patient will have an indwelling and subrapubic catheter (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). Procedures may vary between surgical centers that perform this procedure, but commonly an irrigation of 100&#x00A0;mL normal saline every 6 to 8 hours is prescribed to prevent catheter blockage due to an increase in the amount of mucous discharged from the intestine compared to a regular bladder wall (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Fluid and Electrolytes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid and electrolyte balance is maintained in the immediate postoperative period by closely monitoring the serum electrolyte levels and administering appropriate IV fluids. The patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis and dehydration. Electrolyte replacement may be required to return values to within normal limits.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Encouraging Adequate Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient has additional carbohydrate and protein needs in order to heal from the complex surgery (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). Dietary instructions include increasing the fiber content in the diet to decrease the risk of postoperative ileus, particularly on the fifth postoperative day and following discharge. Increased dietary fiber and other measures are needed to prevent constipation as the intestine is now shorter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education begins in the hospital but continues in the home setting because patients are usually discharged within days of surgery. The neobladder needs 2 to 3 weeks to heal and therefore the patient is discharged home with an indwelling and subrapubic catheter (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). The nurse instructs the patient how to assess and manage the indwelling catheters and irrigate as needed. Once it is determined that the neobladder is watertight, neobladder retraining begins.</p>

</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Neobladder Training</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Void in a sitting position using the Valsalva maneuver to empty the neobladder</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perform all pelvic floor muscle exercises as prescribed, every day.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take steps to avoid constipation: Drink adequate fluids, eat a well-balanced diet high in fiber, exercise regularly, and take stool softeners if recommended.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Void regularly, five to eight times a day (about every 2 to 3 hours):</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>First thing in the morning</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before each meal</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before retiring to bed</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Once during the night if necessary</p>

</div>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education is important and should be provided verbally and in writing (see <a href="#ct49-15">Chart&#x00A0;49-15</a>). The patient should be educated to develop and use a log or diary to record timing of pelvic floor muscle exercises, frequency of voiding and intermittent catheterization, any changes in bowel function, and any episodes of incontinence.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Follow-up care is essential to determine how the patient has adapted to the changes needed to manage the neobladder. Referral for home health is indicated to continue the neobladder training and determine how well the patient and family are coping with the urinary drainage diversion. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical status and emotional response. In addition, the nurse assesses the ability of the patient and family to manage the urinary diversion, reinforces previous education, and provides additional information (e.g., community resources, insurance coverage for supplies).</p>
