<h4 class="h4" id="s785">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An understanding of the structure and function of the heart in health and in disease is essential to develop cardiovascular assessment skills.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s786">Anatomy of the Heart</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The heart is a hollow, muscular organ located in the center of the thorax, where it occupies the space between the lungs (mediastinum) and rests on the diaphragm. It weighs approximately 300 g (10.6 oz); the weight and size of the heart are influenced by age, gender, body weight, extent of physical exercise and conditioning, and heart disease. The heart pumps blood to the tissues, supplying them with oxygen and other nutrients.</p>
<p class="indent">The heart is composed of three layers (<a href="#ff21-1">Fig.&#x00A0;21-1</a>). The inner layer, or endocardium, consists of endothelial tissue and lines the inside of the heart and valves. The middle layer, or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myocardium:&lt;/b&gt; muscle layer of the heart responsible for the pumping action of the heart">myocardium</button></strong>, is made up of muscle fibers and is responsible for the pumping action. The exterior layer of the heart is called the <em>epicardium.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The heart is encased in a thin, fibrous sac called the <em>pericardium,</em> which is composed of two layers. Adhering to the epicardium is the visceral pericardium. Enveloping the visceral pericardium is the parietal pericardium, a tough fibrous tissue that attaches to the great vessels, diaphragm, sternum, and vertebral column and supports the heart in the mediastinum. The space between these two layers (pericardial space) is normally filled with about 20 mL of fluid, which lubricates the surface of the heart and reduces friction during systole.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Heart Chambers</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The pumping action of the heart is accomplished by the rhythmic relaxation and contraction of the muscular walls of its two top chambers (atria) and two bottom chambers (ventricles). During the relaxation phase, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diastole:&lt;/b&gt; period of ventricular relaxation resulting in ventricular filling">diastole</button></strong>, all four chambers relax simultaneously, which allows the ventricles to fill in preparation for contraction. Diastole is commonly referred to as the period of ventricular filling. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;systole:&lt;/b&gt; period of ventricular contraction resulting in ejection of blood from the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and aorta">Systole</button></strong> refers to the events in the heart during contraction of the atria and the ventricles. Unlike diastole, atrial and ventricular systoles are not simultaneous events. Atrial systole occurs first, just at the end of diastole, followed by ventricular systole. This synchronization allows the ventricles to fill completely prior to ejection of blood from these chambers.</p>
<p class="indent">The right side of the heart, made up of the right atrium and right ventricle, distributes venous blood (deoxygenated blood) to the lungs via the pulmonary artery (pulmonary circulation) for oxygenation. The pulmonary artery is the only artery in the body that carries deoxygenated blood. The right atrium receives venous blood returning to the heart from the superior vena cava (head, neck, and upper extremities), inferior vena cava (trunk and lower extremities), and coronary sinus (coronary circulation). The left side of the heart, composed of the left atrium and left ventricle, distributes oxygenated blood to the remainder of the body via the aorta (systemic circulation). The left atrium receives oxygenated blood <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page652" title="652"></span>from the pulmonary circulation via four pulmonary veins. The flow of blood through the four heart chambers is shown in <a href="#ff21-1">Figure&#x00A0;21-1</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff21-1">

<p class="indent">The varying thicknesses of the atrial and ventricular walls are due to the workload required by each chamber. The myocardial layer of both atria is much thinner than that of the ventricles because there is little resistance as blood flows out of the atria and into the ventricles during diastole. In contrast, the ventricular walls are much thicker than the atrial walls. During ventricular systole, the right and left ventricles must overcome resistance to blood flow from the pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, respectively. The left ventricle is two to three times more muscular than the right ventricle. It must overcome high aortic and arterial pressures, whereas the right ventricle contracts against a low-pressure system within the pulmonary arteries and capillaries (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Pappano &#x0026; Weir, 2019</a>). <a href="#ff21-2">Figure&#x00A0;21-2</a> identifies the pressures in each of these areas.</p>

<p class="indent">The heart lies in a rotated position within the chest cavity. The right ventricle lies anteriorly (just beneath the sternum), and the left ventricle is situated posteriorly. As a result of this close proximity to the chest wall, the pulsation created during normal ventricular contraction, called the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apical impulse:&lt;/b&gt; impulse normally palpated at the fifth intercostal space, left midclavicular line; caused by contraction of the left ventricle (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: point of maximal impulse)">apical impulse</button></strong> (also called the <em>point of maximal impulse</em> [PMI]), is easily detected. In the normal heart, the PMI is located at the intersection of the midclavicular line of the left chest wall and the fifth intercostal space (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Heart Valves</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The four valves in the heart permit blood to flow in only one direction. The valves, which are composed of thin leaflets of fibrous tissue, open and close in response to the movement of blood and pressure changes within the chambers. There are two types of valves: atrioventricular (AV) and semilunar.</p>
<p class="h7">Atrioventricular Valves</p>
<p class="nonindent">The AV valves separate the atria from the ventricles. The tricuspid valve, so named because it is composed of three cusps or leaflets, separates the right atrium from the right ventricle. The mitral or bicuspid (two cusps) valve lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle (see <a href="#ff21-1">Fig.&#x00A0;21-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During diastole, the tricuspid and mitral valves are open, allowing the blood in the atria to flow freely into the relaxed ventricles. As ventricular systole begins, the ventricles contract and blood flows upward into the cusps of the tricuspid and mitral valves, causing them to close. As the pressure against these valves increases, two additional structures, the papillary muscles and the chordae tendineae, maintain valve closure. The papillary muscles, located on the sides of the ventricular walls, are connected to the valve leaflets by the chordae tendineae, which are thin fibrous bands. During ventricular systole, contraction of the papillary muscles causes the chordae tendineae to become taut, keeping the valve leaflets approximated and closed. This action prevents backflow of blood into the atria (regurgitation) as blood is ejected out into the pulmonary artery and aorta.</p>
<p class="h7">Semilunar Valves</p>
<p class="nonindent">The two semilunar valves are composed of three leaflets, which are shaped like half-moons. The valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery is called the <em>pulmonic valve.</em> The valve between the left ventricle and the aorta is called the <em>aortic valve.</em> The semilunar valves are closed during diastole. At this point, the pressure in the pulmonary artery and aorta decreases, causing blood to flow back toward the semilunar valves. This action fills the cusps with blood and closes the valves. The semilunar valves are forced open during ventricular systole as blood is ejected from the right and left ventricles into the pulmonary artery and aorta, respectively.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Coronary Arteries <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></h6>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be8724d1792a" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Myocardial Blood Flow</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The left and right coronary arteries and their branches supply arterial blood to the heart. These arteries originate from the aorta just above the aortic valve leaflets. Unlike other arteries, the coronary arteries are perfused during diastole. With a normal heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm, there is ample time during diastole for myocardial perfusion. However, as heart rate increases, diastolic time is shortened, which may not allow adequate time for myocardial perfusion. As a result, patients are at risk for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myocardial ischemia:&lt;/b&gt; condition in which heart muscle cells receive less oxygen than needed">myocardial ischemia</button></strong> (inadequate oxygen supply) during tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 bpm), especially patients with CAD.</p>
<p class="indent">The left coronary artery has three branches. The artery from the point of origin to the first major branch is called the <em>left main coronary artery.</em> Two branches arise from the left main coronary artery: the left anterior descending artery, which courses down the anterior wall of the heart, and the circumflex artery, which circles around to the lateral left wall of the heart.</p>
<p class="indent">The right side of the heart is supplied by the <em>right coronary artery,</em> which travels to the inferior wall of the heart. The posterior wall of the heart receives its blood supply by an additional branch from the right coronary artery called the <em>posterior descending artery</em> (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, <a href="c23-sec02.xhtml#ff23-2">Fig.&#x00A0;23-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Superficial to the coronary arteries are the coronary veins. Venous blood from these veins returns to the heart primarily through the coronary sinus, which is located posteriorly in the right atrium.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Myocardium</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The myocardium is the middle, muscular layer of the atrial and ventricular walls. It is composed of specialized cells called <em>myocytes,</em> which form an interconnected network of muscle fibers. These fibers encircle the heart in a figure-of-eight pattern, forming a spiral from the base (top) of the heart to the apex (bottom). During contraction, this muscular configuration facilitates a twisting and compressive movement of the heart that begins in the atria and moves to the ventricles. The sequential and rhythmic pattern of contraction, followed by relaxation of the muscle fibers, maximizes the volume of blood ejected with each contraction. This cyclical pattern of myocardial contraction is controlled by the conduction system.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s787">Function of the Heart</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiac Electrophysiology</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardiac conduction system:&lt;/b&gt; specialized heart cells strategically located throughout the heart that are responsible for methodically generating and coordinating the transmission of electrical impulses to the myocardial cells">cardiac conduction system</button></strong> generates and transmits electrical impulses that stimulate contraction of the myocardium. Under normal circumstances, the conduction system first stimulates contraction of the atria and then the ventricles. The synchronization of the atrial and ventricular events allows the ventricles to fill completely before ventricular ejection, thereby maximizing cardiac output. Three physiologic characteristics of two types of specialized electrical cells, the nodal cells and the Purkinje cells, provide this synchronization:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Automaticity:</em> ability to initiate an electrical impulse</span></li>
<li><span><em>Excitability:</em> ability to respond to an electrical impulse</span></li>
<li><span><em>Conductivity:</em> ability to transmit an electrical impulse from one cell to another</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Both the <strong>sinoatrial (SA) node</strong> (the primary pacemaker of the heart) and the <strong>atrioventricular (AV) node</strong> (the secondary pacemaker of the heart) are composed of nodal cells. The SA node is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium (<a href="#ff21-3">Fig.&#x00A0;21-3</a>). The SA node in a normal resting adult heart has an inherent firing rate of 60 to 100 impulses per minute; however, the rate changes in response to the metabolic demands of the body (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 653</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page654" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="654">p. 654</span></div>
<div class="figure" id="ff21-3">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff21-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff21-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;21-3 &#x2022;</span> Cardiac conduction system. AV, atrioventricular; SA, sinoatrial.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The electrical impulses initiated by the SA node are conducted along the myocardial cells of the atria via specialized tracts called <em>internodal pathways.</em> The impulses cause electrical stimulation and subsequent contraction of the atria. The impulses are then conducted to the AV node, which is located in the right atrial wall near the tricuspid valve (see <a href="#ff21-3">Fig.&#x00A0;21-3</a>). The AV node coordinates the incoming electrical impulses from the atria and after a slight delay (allowing the atria time to contract and complete ventricular filling) relays the impulse to the ventricles.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, the impulse is conducted through a bundle of specialized conducting tissue, referred to as the bundle of His, which then divides into the right bundle branch (conducting impulses to the right ventricle) and the left bundle branch (conducting impulses to the left ventricle). To transmit impulses to the left ventricle&#x2014;the largest chamber of the heart&#x2014;the left bundle branch divides into the left anterior and left posterior bundle branches. Impulses travel through the bundle branches to reach the terminal point in the conduction system, called the <em>Purkinje fibers.</em> These fibers are composed of Purkinje cells that rapidly conduct impulses throughout the thick walls of the ventricles. This action stimulates the ventricular myocardial cells to contract (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The heart rate is determined by the myocardial cells with the fastest inherent firing rate. Under normal circumstances, the SA node has the highest inherent rate (60 to 100 impulses per minute), the AV node has the second-highest inherent rate (40 to 60 impulses per minute), and the ventricular pacemaker sites have the lowest inherent rate (30 to 40 impulses per minute) (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Wesley, 2017</a>). If the SA node malfunctions, the AV node generally takes over the pacemaker function of the heart at its inherently lower rate. Should both the SA and the AV nodes fail in their pacemaker function, a pacemaker site in the ventricle will fire at its inherent bradycardic rate of 30 to 40 impulses per minute.</p>
<p class="h7">Cardiac Action Potential</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nodal and Purkinje cells (electrical cells) generate and transmit impulses across the heart, stimulating the cardiac myocytes (working cells) to contract. Stimulation of the myocytes occurs due to the exchange of electrically charged particles, called <em>ions,</em> across channels located in the cell membrane. The channels regulate the movement and speed of specific ions&#x2014;namely, sodium, potassium, and calcium&#x2014;as they enter and exit the cell. Sodium rapidly enters into the cell through sodium-fast channels, in contrast to calcium, which enters the cell through calcium-slow channels. In the resting or polarized state, sodium is the primary extracellular ion, whereas potassium is the primary intracellular ion. This difference in ion concentration means that the inside of the cell has a negative charge compared with the positive charge on the outside. The relationship changes during cellular stimulation, when sodium or calcium crosses the cell membrane into the cell and potassium ions exit into the extracellular space. This exchange of ions creates a positively charged intracellular space and a negatively charged extracellular space that characterizes the period known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;depolarization:&lt;/b&gt; electrical activation of a cell caused by the influx of sodium into the cell while potassium exits the cell">depolarization</button></strong>. Once depolarization is complete, the exchange of ions reverts to its resting state; this period is known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;repolarization:&lt;/b&gt; return of the cell to resting state, caused by reentry of potassium into the cell while sodium exits the cell">repolarization</button></strong>. The repeated cycle of depolarization and repolarization is called the <em>cardiac action potential.</em></p>
<div class="figure" id="ff21-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff21-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff21-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;21-4 &#x2022;</span> Cardiac action potential of a fast-response Purkinje fiber. The <em>arrows</em> indicate the approximate time and direction of movement of each ion influencing membrane potential. Ca<sup>++</sup> movement out of the cell is not well defined but is thought to occur during phase 4.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">As shown in <a href="#ff21-4">Figure&#x00A0;21-4</a>, the cardiac action potential has five phases:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Phase 0:</em> Cellular depolarization is initiated as positive ions influx into the cell. During this phase, the atrial and ventricular myocytes rapidly depolarize as sodium moves into the cells through sodium-fast channels. The myocytes have a fast-response action potential. In contrast, the cells of the SA and AV node depolarize when calcium enters these cells through calcium-slow channels. These cells have a slow-response action potential.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Phase 1:</em> Early cellular repolarization begins during this phase as potassium exits the intracellular space.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Phase 2:</em> This phase is called the <em>plateau phase</em> because the rate of repolarization slows. Calcium ions enter the intracellular space.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Phase 3:</em> This phase marks the completion of repolarization and return of the cell to its resting state.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Phase 4:</em> This phase is considered the resting phase before the next depolarization.</span></li></ul>
<p class="h7">Refractory Periods</p>
<p class="nonindent">Myocardial cells must completely repolarize before they can depolarize again. During the repolarization process, the cells are in a refractory period. There are two phases of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page655" title="655"></span>the refractory period: the effective (or absolute) refractory period and the relative refractory period. During the effective refractory period, the cell is completely unresponsive to any electrical stimulus; it is incapable of initiating an early depolarization. The effective refractory period corresponds with the time in phase 0 to the middle of phase 3 of the action potential. The relative refractory period corresponds with the short time at the end of phase 3. During the relative refractory period, if an electrical stimulus is stronger than normal, the cell may depolarize prematurely. Early depolarizations of the atrium or ventricle cause premature contractions, placing the patient at risk for arrhythmias. Premature ventricular contractions in certain situations, such as the presence of myocardial ischemia, are of concern because these early ventricular depolarizations can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Several circumstances make the heart more susceptible to early depolarization during the relative refractory period, thus increasing the risk for serious arrhythmias. (These arrhythmias and others are discussed in detail in <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiac Hemodynamics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An important determinant of blood flow in the cardiovascular system is the principle that fluid flows from a region of higher pressure to one of lower pressure (see <a href="#ff21-2">Fig.&#x00A0;21-2</a>). The pressures responsible for blood flow in the normal circulation are generated during systole and diastole.</p>
<p class="h7">Cardiac Cycle <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be86d1aa8050" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Cardiac Cycle</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The cardiac cycle refers to the events that occur in the heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the next. The number of cardiac cycles completed in a minute depends on the heart rate. Each cardiac cycle has three major sequential events: diastole, atrial systole, and ventricular systole. These events cause blood to flow through the heart due to changes in chamber pressures and valvular function during diastole and systole. During diastole, all four heart chambers are relaxed. As a result, the AV valves are open and the semilunar valves are closed. Pressures in all of the chambers are the lowest during diastole, which facilitates ventricular filling. Venous blood returns to the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cava, then into the right ventricle. On the left side, oxygenated blood returns from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins into the left atrium and ventricle.</p>
<p class="indent">Toward the end of this diastolic period, atrial systole occurs as the atrial muscles contract in response to an electrical impulse initiated by the SA node. Atrial systole increases the pressure inside the atria, ejecting the remaining blood into the ventricles. Atrial systole augments ventricular blood volume by 15% to 25% and is sometimes referred to as the atrial kick (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Wesley, 2017</a>). At this point, ventricular systole begins in response to propagation of the electrical impulse that began in the SA node some milliseconds earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning with ventricular systole, the pressure inside the ventricles rapidly increases, forcing the AV valves to close. As a result, blood ceases to flow from the atria into the ventricles, and regurgitation (backflow) of blood into the atria is prevented. The rapid increase in pressure inside the right and left ventricles forces the pulmonic and aortic valves to open, and blood is ejected into the pulmonary artery and aorta, respectively. The exit of blood is at first rapid; then, as the pressure in each ventricle and its corresponding artery equalizes, the flow of blood gradually decreases. At the end of systole, pressure within the right and left ventricles rapidly decreases. As a result, pulmonary arterial and aortic pressures decrease, causing closure of the semilunar valves. These events mark the onset of diastole, and the cardiac cycle is repeated.</p>
<p class="indent">Chamber pressures can be measured with the use of special monitoring catheters and equipment. This technique is called <strong>hemodynamic monitoring.</strong> Methods of hemodynamic monitoring are covered in more detail at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="h7">Cardiac Output</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardiac output:&lt;/b&gt; amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in liters per minute">Cardiac output</button></strong> refers to the total amount of blood ejected by one of the ventricles in liters per minute. The cardiac output in a resting adult is 4 to 6 L/min but varies greatly depending on the metabolic needs of the body. Cardiac output is computed by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stroke volume:&lt;/b&gt; amount of blood ejected from one of the ventricles per heartbeat">Stroke volume</button></strong> is the amount of blood ejected from one of the ventricles per heartbeat. The average resting stroke volume is about 60 to 130 mL (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Effect of Heart Rate on Cardiac Output</p>
<p class="nonindent">The cardiac output responds to changes in the metabolic demands of the tissues associated with stress, physical exercise, and illness. To compensate for these added demands, the cardiac output is enhanced by increases in both stroke volume and heart rate. Changes in heart rate are due to inhibition or stimulation of the SA node mediated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. The balance between these two reflex control systems normally determines the heart rate. Branches of the parasympathetic nervous system travel to the SA node by the vagus nerve. Stimulation of the vagus nerve slows the heart rate. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate by innervation of the beta-1 receptor sites located within the SA node. The heart rate is increased by the sympathetic nervous system through an increased level of circulating catecholamines (secreted by the adrenal gland) and by excess thyroid hormone, which produces a catecholamine-like effect.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the heart rate is affected by central nervous system and baroreceptor activity. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;baroreceptors:&lt;/b&gt; nerve fibers located in the aortic arch and carotid arteries that are responsible for control of the blood pressure">Baroreceptors</button></strong> are specialized nerve cells located in the aortic arch and in both right and left internal carotid arteries (at the point of bifurcation from the common carotid arteries). The baroreceptors are sensitive to changes in blood pressure (BP). During hypertension (significant elevations in BP), these cells increase their rate of discharge, transmitting impulses to the cerebral medulla. This action initiates parasympathetic activity and inhibits sympathetic response, lowering the heart rate and the BP. The opposite is true during hypotension (low BP). Decreased baroreceptor stimulation during periods of hypotension prompts a decrease in parasympathetic activity and enhances sympathetic responses. These compensatory mechanisms attempt to elevate the BP through vasoconstriction and increased heart rate.</p>
<p class="h8">Effect of Stroke Volume on Cardiac Output</p>
<p class="nonindent">Stroke volume is primarily determined by three factors: preload, afterload, and contractility.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;preload:&lt;/b&gt; degree of stretch of the cardiac muscle fibers at the end of diastole">Preload</button></strong> refers to the degree of stretch of the ventricular cardiac muscle fibers at the end of diastole. The end of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page656" title="656"></span>diastole is the period when filling volume in the ventricles is the highest and the degree of stretch on the muscle fibers is the greatest. The volume of blood within the ventricle at the end of diastole determines preload, which directly affects stroke volume. Therefore, preload is commonly referred to as left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. As the volume of blood returning to the heart increases, muscle fiber stretch also increases (increased preload), resulting in stronger contraction and a greater stroke volume. This relationship, referred to as the Frank&#x2013;Starling (or Starling) law of the heart, is maintained until the physiologic limit of the muscle is reached.</p>
<p class="indent">The Frank&#x2013;Starling law is based on the fact that, within limits, the greater the initial length or stretch of the sarcomeres (cardiac muscle cells), the greater the degree of shortening that occurs. This result is caused by increased interaction between the thick and thin filaments within the cardiac muscle cells. Preload is decreased by a reduction in the volume of blood returning to the ventricles. Diuresis, venodilating agents (e.g., nitrates), excessive loss of blood, or dehydration (excessive loss of body fluids from vomiting, diarrhea, or diaphoresis) reduce preload. Preload is increased by increasing the return of circulating blood volume to the ventricles. Controlling the loss of blood or body fluids and replacing fluids (i.e., blood transfusions and intravenous [IV] fluid administration) are examples of ways to increase preload.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;afterload:&lt;/b&gt; the amount of resistance to ejection of blood from the ventricle">Afterload</button></strong>, or resistance to ejection of blood from the ventricle, is the second determinant of stroke volume. The resistance of the systemic BP to left ventricular ejection is called <strong>systemic vascular resistance.</strong> The resistance of the pulmonary BP to right ventricular ejection is called <strong>pulmonary vascular resistance.</strong> There is an inverse relationship between afterload and stroke volume. For example, afterload is increased by arterial vasoconstriction, which leads to decreased stroke volume. The opposite is true with arterial vasodilation, in which case afterload is reduced because there is less resistance to ejection, and stroke volume increases.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;contractility:&lt;/b&gt; ability of the cardiac muscle to shorten in response to an electrical impulse">Contractility</button></strong> refers to the force generated by the contracting myocardium. Contractility is enhanced by circulating catecholamines, sympathetic neuronal activity, and certain medications (e.g., digoxin, dopamine, or dobutamine). Increased contractility results in increased stroke volume. Contractility is depressed by hypoxemia, acidosis, and certain medications (e.g., beta-adrenergic&#x2013;blocking agents such as metoprolol).</p>
<p class="indent">The heart can achieve an increase in stroke volume (e.g., during exercise) if preload is increased (through increased venous return), if contractility is increased (through sympathetic nervous system discharge), and if afterload is decreased (through peripheral vasodilation with decreased aortic pressure).</p>
<p class="indent">The percentage of the end-diastolic blood volume that is ejected with each heartbeat is called the <strong>ejection fraction.</strong> The ejection fraction of the normal left ventricle is 55% to 65% (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Wiegand, 2017</a>). The right ventricular ejection fraction is rarely measured. The ejection fraction is used as a measure of myocardial contractility. An ejection fraction of less than 40% indicates that the patient has decreased left ventricular function and likely requires treatment of HF (refer to <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for further discussion).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Changes in cardiac structure and function occur with age. A loss of function of the cells throughout the conduction system leads to a slower heart rate. The size of the heart increases due to hypertrophy (thickening of the heart walls), which reduces the volume of blood that the chambers can hold. Hypertrophy also changes the structure of the myocardium, reducing the strength of contraction. Both of these changes negatively affect cardiac output. The valves, due to stiffening, no longer close properly. The resulting backflow of blood creates heart murmurs, a common finding in older adults (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Bickley, 2017</a>; <a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Pappano &#x0026; Weir, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of these age-related changes, the cardiovascular system takes longer to compensate from increased metabolic demands due to stress, exercise, or illness. In these situations, older adults may become symptomatic with fatigue, shortness of breath, or palpitations and present with new physical examination findings (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Bickley, 2017</a>; <a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1645">Zipes, Libby, Bonow, et al., 2019</a>). The structural and functional changes with aging and associated history and physical examination findings are summarized in <a href="c21-sec02.xhtml#tt21-1">Table&#x00A0;21-1</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s789">Gender Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Structural differences between the hearts of men and women have significant implications. The heart of a woman tends to be smaller than that of a man. The coronary arteries of a woman are also narrower in diameter than a man&#x2019;s arteries. When atherosclerosis occurs, these differences make procedures such as cardiac catheterization and angioplasty technically more difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">Women typically develop CAD 10 years later than men, as women have the benefit of the cardioprotective effects of the female hormone estrogen. The three major effects of estrogen are (1) an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that transports cholesterol out of arteries; (2) a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that deposits cholesterol in the artery; and (3) dilation of the blood vessels, which enhance blood flow to the heart. As testosterone increases and estrogen decreases, women who are postmenopausal have a greater risk of CAD, CVD, and HF (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1683">Zhao, Guallar, Ouyang, et al., 2018</a>). Hormone therapy (HT) is not recommended for routine prevention of CAD in women who are postmenopausal, although there are possible benefits to cardiovascular health if HT is initiated soon after the initiation of menopause (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1659">Keck &#x0026; Taylor, 2018</a>).</p>
