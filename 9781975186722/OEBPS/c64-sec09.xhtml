<h4 class="h4" id="s3055">Myasthenia Gravis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder affecting the myoneural junction, is characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the voluntary muscles. It is uncommon, with an incidence between 9 and 30 in 1 million people in the United States (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). It occurs more often in women during the second and third decades of life; however, after age 50, it is more common in men (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3056">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Normally, a chemical impulse precipitates the release of acetylcholine from vesicles on the nerve terminal at the myoneural junction. The acetylcholine attaches to receptor sites on the motor endplate and stimulates muscle contraction. Continuous binding of acetylcholine to the receptor site is required for muscular contraction to be sustained.</p>
<p class="indent">In myasthenia gravis, antibodies directed at the acetylcholine receptor sites impair transmission of impulses across the myoneural junction. Therefore, fewer receptors are available for stimulation, resulting in voluntary muscle weakness that escalates with continued activity (see <a href="#ff64-4">Fig.&#x00A0;64-4</a>). These <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2101" title="2101"></span>antibodies are found in 85% of people with myasthenia gravis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Of people with myasthenia gravis, most have either thymic hyperplasia or a thymic tumor, and the thymus gland is believed to be the site of antibody production. In patients who are acetylcholine receptor antibody negative, other antibodies appear to target a protein in the myoneural junction (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3057">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical manifestation of myasthenia gravis is highly variable. There are two clinical types: ocular and generalized. In the ocular form, only the eye muscles are involved. Diplopia and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ptosis:&lt;/b&gt; drooping eyelid">ptosis</button></strong> (drooping of the eyelids) are common (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). In the generalized form, patients experience weakness of the muscles of the face and throat (bulbar symptoms), limbs, and respiratory weakness. Weakness of the facial muscles results in a bland facial expression. Laryngeal involvement produces <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysphonia:&lt;/b&gt; voice impairment or altered voice production">dysphonia</button></strong> (voice impairment) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysphagia:&lt;/b&gt; difficulty swallowing">dysphagia</button></strong> (difficulty swallowing), which increases the risk of choking and aspiration. Generalized weakness affects all extremities and may involve the intercostal muscles, resulting in decreasing vital capacity and respiratory failure. When this occurs, the patient is in a myasthenic crisis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4466">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], 2020</a>). Myasthenia gravis is purely a motor disorder with no effect on sensation or coordination.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3058">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A common test used to diagnose myasthenia gravis is the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor test. It is performed by administering edrophonium chloride IV; 30 seconds after injection, facial muscle weakness and ptosis should resolve for about 5 minutes (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Immediate improvement in muscle strength after administration of this agent represents a positive test and usually confirms the diagnosis. Atropine should be available to control potential side effects of this medication, which include bradycardia, asystole, bronchoconstriction, sweating, and cramping.</p>
<p class="indent">Another study, the ice test, is indicated in patients who have cardiac conditions or asthma. With this test, an ice pack is held over the patient&#x2019;s eyes for 1 minute; the ptosis should temporarily resolve in a patient with myasthenia gravis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Several blood tests for acetylcholine antibodies are also used to confirm the diagnosis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) demonstrates a decrease in successive action potentials. A single-fiber electromyography (EMG) detects a delay or failure of neuromuscular transmission and is about 99% sensitive in confirming the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). This is an uncomfortable test for the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The thymus gland, a site of acetylcholine receptor antibody production, may be enlarged in myasthenia gravis and may be identified by MRI scan.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3059">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of myasthenia gravis is directed at improving function and reducing and removing circulating antibodies. Therapeutic modalities include administration of anticholinesterase medications and immunosuppressive therapy, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), therapeutic plasma exchange, and thymectomy. There is no cure for myasthenia gravis; treatments do not stop the production of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pyridostigmine bromide, an anticholinesterase medication, is the first line of therapy (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). It provides symptomatic relief by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine and increasing the relative concentration of available acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The dosage is gradually increased to a daily maximum and is given in divided doses (usually four times a day). Adverse effects of anticholinesterase medications include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and/or excessive saliva (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Pyridostigmine tends to have fewer side effects than other anticholinesterase medications.</p>
<p class="indent">If pyridostigmine bromide does not improve muscle strength and control fatigue, the next agents used are the immunomodulating drugs. The goal of immunosuppressive therapy is to reduce production of the antibody. Corticosteroids suppress the patient&#x2019;s immune response, decreasing the amount of antibody production, and this correlates with clinical improvement. An initial dose of prednisone is given daily and maintained for 1 to 2 months; as symptoms improve, the medication is tapered (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). As the corticosteroid medications take effect, the dosage of anticholinesterase medication can usually be lowered. Cytotoxic medications are used to treat myasthenia gravis if there is inadequate response to steroids. Azathioprine inhibits T lymphocytes and B-cell proliferation and reduces acetylcholine receptor antibody levels. Therapeutic effects may not be evident for 3 to 12 months. Leukopenia and hepatotoxicity are serious adverse effects, so monthly evaluation of liver enzymes and white blood cell count is necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">IVIG can be used to treat exacerbations; however, in select patients, it is used on a long-term adjunctive basis. IVIG treatment involves the administration of pooled human gamma-globulin and improvement occurs in a few days to a week (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The effects of IVIG typically last only about 28 days after infusion, and complications include headache, migraine exacerbation, aseptic meningitis, and flulike symptoms (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4475">Vitiello, Emmi, Silvestri, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A number of medications are contraindicated for patients with myasthenia gravis because they exacerbate the symptoms. The primary provider and the patient should weigh risks and benefits before any new medications are prescribed. Procaine should be avoided, and the patient&#x2019;s dentist is informed of the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Therapeutic Plasma Exchange</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A technique called therapeutic plasma exchange, formerly referred to as plasmapheresis, is used to treat exacerbations. The patient&#x2019;s plasma and plasma components are removed through a centrally placed large-bore double-lumen catheter. The blood cells and antibody-containing plasma are separated, after which the cells and a plasma substitute are reinfused. Temporary reduction in the level of circulating antibodies is provided with therapeutic plasma exchange. A typical course consists of daily or alternate-day treatment, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2102" title="2102"></span>and the number of treatments is determined by the patient&#x2019;s response (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>)</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Thymectomy (surgical removal of the thymus gland) can produce antigen-specific immunosuppression and result in clinical improvement. Optimal outcomes of the surgery are in patients younger than 60 years who have had myasthenia gravis diagnosed within the past 3 years. It is the only treatment that can result in complete remission, which occurs in approximately 35% of patients (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A course of preoperative IVIG or therapeutic plasma exchange decreases the time needed for postoperative mechanical ventilation. The entire thymus gland must be removed for optimal clinical outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">A thymectomy should be performed at a designated center with a surgical and anesthesia staff experienced in the perioperative management of those with myasthenia gravis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). After surgery, the patient is monitored in an intensive care unit, with special attention to respiratory function. The patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation after thorough respiratory assessment. After the thymus gland is removed, it may take up to 3 years for the patient to benefit from the procedure because of the long life of circulating T cells. Thymectomy is considered an elective surgery and best performed when the clinical course of the disease is stable for optimal outcomes (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3060"><img src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A myasthenic crisis is an exacerbation of the disease process characterized by severe generalized muscle weakness and respiratory and bulbar weakness that may result in respiratory failure. Crisis may result from disease exacerbation or a specific precipitating event. The most common precipitator is respiratory infection; others include medication change, surgery, pregnancy, and medications that exacerbate myasthenia. A cholinergic crisis caused by overmedication with cholinesterase inhibitors is rare (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Neuromuscular respiratory failure is the critical complication in myasthenic and cholinergic crises. Respiratory muscle and bulbar weakness combine to cause respiratory compromise. Weak respiratory muscles do not support inhalation. An inadequate cough and an impaired gag reflex, caused by bulbar weakness, result in poor airway clearance. A downward trend of two respiratory function tests, the negative inspiratory force and vital capacity, is the first clinical sign of respiratory compromise.</p>
<p class="indent">Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation uses an external device in the form of a vest that provides respiratory support without endotracheal intubation. Cholinesterase inhibitors are stopped when respiratory failure occurs and gradually restarted after the patient demonstrates improvement with a course of therapeutic plasma exchange or IVIG. Nutritional support may be needed if the patient is intubated for a long period or swallowing ability is affected (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3061">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because myasthenia gravis is a chronic disease and most patients are seen on an outpatient basis, much of the nursing care focuses on patient and family education. Educational topics for outpatient self-care include medication management, energy conservation, strategies to help with ocular manifestations, and prevention and management of complications.</p>
<p class="indent">Medication management is a crucial component of ongoing care. Understanding the actions of the medications and taking them on schedule is emphasized, as are the consequences of delaying medication and the signs and symptoms of myasthenic and cholinergic crises. The patient can determine the best times for daily dosing by keeping a diary to determine fluctuation of symptoms and to learn when the medication is wearing off. The medication schedule can then be manipulated to maximize strength throughout the day.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Maintenance of stable blood levels of anticholinesterase medications is imperative to stabilize muscle strength. Therefore, the anticholinesterase medications must be given on time. Any delay in administration of medications may exacerbate muscle weakness and make it impossible for the patient to take medications orally.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Regular administration of IVIG or subcutaneous immunoglobulin may be prescribed. The patient and family are educated about managing immunoglobulin therapy.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box2102"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for management of IVIG, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is also educated about strategies to conserve energy. To do this, the nurse helps the patient identify the optimal times for rest throughout the day. If the patient lives in a two-story home, the nurse can suggest that frequently used items (e.g., hygiene products, cleaning products, snacks) be kept on each floor to minimize travel between floors. The patient is encouraged to apply for a handicapped license plate to minimize walking from parking spaces and to schedule activities to coincide with peak energy and strength levels. Using consistent routines, scheduling periods of rest, monitoring for depression, maintaining good sleep patterns, and incorporating interventions to conserve energy are all strategies to reduce fatigue (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To minimize the risk of aspiration, mealtimes should coincide with the peak effects of anticholinesterase medication. In addition, rest before meals is encouraged to reduce muscle fatigue. The patient is advised to sit upright during meals, with the neck slightly flexed to facilitate swallowing. Soft foods in gravy or sauces can be swallowed more easily. Eating larger meals in the morning and smaller meals in the evening is another good strategy. Supplemental feedings may be helpful to ensure adequate nutrition.</p>
<p class="indent">If choking occurs frequently, the patient should be evaluated by a speech-language pathologist for formal dietary and mechanical techniques to avoid aspiration. Suction should be available at home, with the patient and family instructed in its use.</p>
<p class="indent">Impaired vision results from ptosis of one or both eyelids, decreased eye movement, or double vision. To prevent corneal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2103" title="2103"></span>damage when the eyelids do not close completely, the patient is instructed to tape the eyes closed for short intervals and to regularly instill artificial tears. Patients who wear eyeglasses can have &#x201C;crutches&#x201D; attached to help lift the eyelids. Patching of one eye or wearing prism glasses can help with double vision.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is reminded of the importance of maintaining health promotion practices and following health care screening recommendations. Factors that exacerbate symptoms and potentially cause crisis should be noted and avoided: emotional stress, infections (particularly respiratory infections), vigorous physical activity, some medications, and high environmental temperature. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America provides support services and educational materials for patients, families, and health care providers (see the Resources section).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> Myasthenic Crisis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Respiratory distress and varying degrees of dysphagia, dysarthria, eyelid ptosis, diplopia, and prominent muscle weakness are symptoms of myasthenic crisis. The patient is placed in an intensive care unit for constant monitoring because of associated intense and sudden fluctuations in clinical condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Providing ventilatory assistance takes precedence in the immediate management of the patient with myasthenic crisis. Ongoing assessment for respiratory failure is essential. The nurse assesses the respiratory rate, depth, and breath sounds and monitors pulmonary function parameters (vital capacity and negative inspiratory force) to detect pulmonary problems before respiratory dysfunction progresses. Blood is drawn for arterial blood gas analysis. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the abdominal, intercostal, and pharyngeal muscles are severely weak, the patient cannot cough, take deep breaths, or clear secretions. Chest physiotherapy, including postural drainage to mobilize secretions and suctioning to remove secretions, may have to be performed frequently. (Postural drainage should not be performed for 30 minutes after feeding.)</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment strategies and supportive measures include the following:</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, input and output, and daily weight are monitored.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>If the patient cannot swallow, enteral tube feedings may be prescribed (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Sedative and tranquilizing agents are avoided, because they aggravate hypoxia and hypercapnia and can cause respiratory and cardiac depression.</span></li></ul>
