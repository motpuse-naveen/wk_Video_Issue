<h4 class="h4" id="s681"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Acute Respiratory Failure</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Respiratory failure is a sudden and life-threatening deterioration of the gas exchange function of the lungs and indicates their failure to provide adequate oxygenation or ventilation for the blood. Acute respiratory failure is defined as hypoxemia (a decrease in arterial oxygen tension [PaO<sub>2</sub>] to less than 60 mm Hg) and hypercapnia (an increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] to greater than 50 mm Hg), with acidosis (an arterial pH of less than 7.35) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kaynar, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic respiratory failure. Chronic respiratory failure is defined as deterioration in the gas exchange function of the lungs that has developed insidiously or has persisted for a long period after an episode of acute respiratory failure. The absence of acute symptoms and the presence of a chronic respiratory acidosis suggest the chronicity of the respiratory failure. Two causes of chronic respiratory failure are COPD (discussed in <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>) and neuromuscular diseases (discussed in <a href="c65.xhtml">Chapter 65</a>). Patients with these disorders develop a tolerance to the gradually worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia. However, patients with chronic respiratory failure can develop acute failure. For example, a patient with COPD may develop an exacerbation or infection that causes additional deterioration of gas exchange. The principles of management of acute versus chronic respiratory failure are different; the following discussion is limited to acute respiratory failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s682">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In acute respiratory failure, the ventilation or perfusion mechanisms in the lung are impaired. Some of the many ventilatory failure mechanisms leading to acute respiratory failure include impaired function of the central nervous system (e.g., drug overdose, head trauma, infection, hemorrhage, sleep apnea), neuromuscular dysfunction (e.g., myasthenia gravis, Guillain&#x2013;Barr&#x00E9; syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord trauma), musculoskeletal dysfunction (e.g., chest trauma, kyphoscoliosis, malnutrition), and pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis).</p>
<p class="indent">Oxygenation failure mechanisms leading to acute respiratory failure include pneumonia, ARDS, heart failure, COPD, PE, and <strong>restrictive lung diseases</strong> (diseases that cause decrease in lung volumes).</p>
<p class="indent">In the postoperative period, especially after major thoracic or abdominal surgery, inadequate ventilation and respiratory failure may occur because of several factors. During this period, for example, acute respiratory failure may be caused by the effects of anesthetic, analgesic, and sedative agents, which may depress respiration (as described earlier) or enhance the effects of opioids and lead to hypoventilation. Pain may interfere with deep breathing and coughing. A V./Q. mismatch is the usual cause of respiratory failure after major abdominal, cardiac, or thoracic surgery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s683">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Early signs are those associated with impaired oxygenation and may include restlessness, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, air hunger, tachycardia, and increased blood pressure. As the hypoxemia progresses, more obvious signs may be present, including confusion, lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, central cyanosis, diaphoresis, and finally respiratory arrest. Physical findings are those of acute respiratory distress, including the use of accessory muscles, decreased breath sounds if the patient cannot adequately ventilate, and other findings related specifically to the underlying disease process and cause of acute respiratory failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s684">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of treatment are to correct the underlying cause and to restore adequate gas exchange in the lungs. ET intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation while the underlying cause is corrected (see later discussion on ET intubation and mechanical ventilation).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s685">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of patients with acute respiratory failure includes assisting with intubation and maintaining mechanical ventilation. Patients are usually managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status by monitoring the level of responsiveness, arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and vital signs. In addition, the entire respiratory system is assessed and strategies to prevent complications (e.g., turning schedule, mouth care, skin care, and range of motion of extremities) are implemented. The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of the management strategies that are used and initiates some form of communication to enable the patient to express concerns and needs to the health care team.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the problems that led to the acute respiratory failure are addressed. As the patient&#x2019;s status improves, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s knowledge of the underlying disorder and provides education as appropriate to address the disorder.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endotracheal Intubation</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endotracheal intubation:&lt;/b&gt; insertion of a breathing tube (type of artificial airway) through the nose or mouth into the trachea">Endotracheal intubation</button></strong> involves passing an ET tube through the nose or mouth into the trachea (see <a href="#ff19-5">Fig.&#x00A0;19-5</a>). The oral route is preferred since oral intubation is associated with less trauma and lesser rates of infection; furthermore, the oral route can typically accommodate a larger diameter ET tube than may be passed when the nasal route is used. Intubation provides a patent airway when the patient is having respiratory distress that cannot be treated with simpler methods and is the method of choice in emergency care. ET intubation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page557" title="557"></span>is a means of providing an airway for patients who cannot maintain an adequate airway on their own (e.g., patients who are comatose and patients with upper airway obstruction), for patients needing mechanical ventilation, and for suctioning secretions from the pulmonary tree.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff19-5">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff19-5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff19-5.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;19-5 &#x2022;</span> Endotracheal tube in place. The tube has been inserted using the oral route. The cuff has been inflated to maintain the tube&#x2019;s position and to minimize the risk of aspiration.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">An ET tube usually is passed with the aid of a laryngoscope by specifically trained medical, nursing, or respiratory therapy personnel. Once the tube is inserted and positioned about 2 cm above the carina, a cuff at the distal end of the ET tube is inflated with the use of a pilot balloon. Inflation of the cuff prevents air from leaking around the outer part of the tube in order to minimize the possibility of aspiration and secure the tube. The position of the ET tube is verified by checking end-tidal carbon dioxide levels and confirmed with chest x-ray. <a href="#ct19-12">Chart&#x00A0;19-12</a> discusses the nursing care of the patient with an ET tube.</p>
<p class="indent">Complications can occur from pressure exerted by the cuff on the tracheal wall. Cuff pressures should be maintained between 20 and 25 mm Hg (24 and 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) because high cuff pressure can cause tracheal bleeding, ischemia, and pressure necrosis, whereas low cuff pressure can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Routine deflation of the cuff is not recommended because of the increased risk of aspiration and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypoxia:&lt;/b&gt; inadequate supply of oxygen to the cell">hypoxia</button></strong> (i.e., decrease in oxygen supply to the tissues and cells) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>). Tracheobronchial secretions are suctioned through the tube. Warmed, humidified oxygen should always be introduced through the tube, whether the patient is breathing spontaneously or is receiving ventilatory support. ET intubation may be used for no longer than 14 to 21 days, by which time a tracheostomy must be considered to decrease irritation of and trauma to the tracheal lining, to reduce the incidence of vocal cord paralysis (secondary to laryngeal nerve damage), and to decrease the work of breathing (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">ET and tracheostomy tubes have several disadvantages. The tubes cause discomfort. The cough reflex is depressed because glottis closure is hindered. Secretions tend to become thicker because the warming and humidifying effect of the upper respiratory tract has been bypassed. The swallowing reflexes (glottic, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes) are depressed because of prolonged disuse and the mechanical trauma produced by the ET or tracheostomy tube, increasing the risk of aspiration as well as microaspiration and subsequent VAP (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>). In addition, ulceration and stricture of the larynx or trachea may develop. Of great concern to the patient is the inability to talk and to communicate needs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tracheostomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tracheotomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical opening into the trachea">tracheotomy</button></strong> is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the trachea. The indwelling tube inserted into the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page558" title="558"></span>trachea is called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tracheostomy tube:&lt;/b&gt; indwelling tube inserted directly into the trachea to assist with ventilation">tracheostomy tube</button></strong> (see <a href="#ff19-6">Fig.&#x00A0;19-6</a> for the different types of tracheostomy tubes). A tracheostomy (the stoma that is the product of the tracheotomy) may be either temporary or permanent.</p>

<p class="indent">A tracheotomy is used to maintain a patent airway, bypass an upper airway obstruction, facilitate removal of tracheobronchial secretions, permit the long-term use of mechanical ventilation, replace an ET tube, and prevent aspiration of oral or gastric secretions in the patient who is unconscious or paralyzed (by closing off the trachea from the esophagus). Many disease processes and emergency conditions make a tracheotomy necessary.</p>
<p class="h7">Tracheotomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">The tracheotomy procedure is usually performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, where the patient&#x2019;s ventilation can be well controlled and optimal aseptic technique can be maintained. A surgical opening is made between the second and third tracheal rings. After the trachea is exposed, a cuffed tracheostomy tube of an appropriate size is inserted. The cuff is an inflatable attachment to the tracheostomy tube that is designed to occlude the space between the tracheal walls and the tube, to permit effective mechanical ventilation, and to minimize the risk of aspiration.</p>
<p class="indent">For a patient who is intubated and mechanically ventilated, a newer surgical technique referred to as a percutaneous tracheostomy can be performed at the patient&#x2019;s bedside with the use of local anesthesia and sedation and analgesia. Using video-assisted guidance, a bronchoscope is passed down the ET tube. Following ET tube cuff deflation, the ET tube is withdrawn to the subglottic level. An opening is made in the skin between the second and third tracheal ring and enlarged with the use of dilators until the space is large enough to safely insert a tracheostomy tube. The ET tube and bronchoscope are then removed and the tracheostomy is secured into position (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Lindman, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The tracheostomy tube is held in place by a velcro tube holder or twill tape ties fastened around the patient&#x2019;s neck. Usually, a square of sterile gauze is placed between the tube and the skin to absorb drainage and reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p class="h7">Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Complications may occur early or late in the course of tracheostomy tube management. They may even occur years after the tube has been removed. Early complications include tube dislodgement, accidental decannulation, bleeding, pneumothorax, air embolism, aspiration, subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema, recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, and posterior tracheal wall penetration. Long-term complications include airway obstruction from accumulation of secretions or protrusion of the cuff over the opening of the tube, infection, rupture of the innominate artery, dysphagia, tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheal dilation, tracheal ischemia, and necrosis. Tracheal stenosis may develop after the tube is removed. <a href="#ct19-13">Chart&#x00A0;19-13</a> outlines measures nurses can take to prevent complications with use of ET and tracheostomy tubes.</p>
<p class="h7">Care of the Patient with an Endotracheal Tube or Tracheostomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient requires continuous monitoring and assessment. The newly made opening must be kept patent by proper suctioning of secretions. After the vital signs are stable, the patient is placed in a semi-Fowler position to facilitate ventilation, promote drainage, minimize edema, and prevent strain on the suture lines. Analgesia and sedative agents must be given with caution because of the risk of suppressing the cough reflex.</p>

<p class="indent">Major objectives of nursing care are to ensure a patent airway, monitor the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status, assess for complications, alleviate the patient&#x2019;s apprehension, and provide an effective means of communication. The nurse keeps paper and pencil or a Magic Slate<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> or a cellular device and the call light within the patient&#x2019;s reach at all times to ensure a means of communication.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box559"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for nursing care of a patient with a tracheostomy tube, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="h8">Suctioning the Tracheostomy or Endotracheal Tube</p>
<p class="nonindent">When a tracheostomy or ET tube is in place, it is usually necessary to suction the patient&#x2019;s secretions because of the decreased effectiveness of the cough mechanism. Tracheal suctioning is performed when adventitious breath sounds are detected or whenever secretions are obviously present. Unnecessary suctioning can initiate bronchospasm and cause mechanical trauma to the tracheal mucosa.</p>
<p class="indent">All equipment that comes into direct contact with the patient&#x2019;s lower airway must be sterile to prevent sepsis.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for suctioning a patient with a tracheostomy tube, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients who are mechanically ventilated (see later discussion), an in-line suction catheter may be used to allow rapid suction when needed and to minimize cross-contamination by airborne pathogens. An in-line suction device allows the patient to be suctioned without being disconnected from the ventilator circuit. In-line suctioning (also called <em>closed suctioning</em>) decreases hypoxemia, sustains PEEP, and can decrease patient anxiety associated with suctioning (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>). Because in-line suctioning protects staff from patient secretions, it can be performed in most cases without using personal protective gear. A notable exception is when the patient has COVID-19, when PPE must be used.</p>
<p class="h8">Managing the Cuff</p>
<p class="nonindent">The cuff on an ET or tracheostomy tube should be inflated if the patient requires mechanical ventilation or is at high risk for aspiration. The pressure within the cuff should be the lowest possible pressure (20 to 25 mm Hg) that allows delivery of adequate tidal volumes and prevents pulmonary aspiration (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>). Cuff pressure must be monitored by the respiratory therapist or nurse at least every 8 hours by attaching a handheld pressure gauge to the pilot balloon of the tube or by using the minimal leak volume or minimal occlusion volume technique.</p>
<p class="h8">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="indent"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="H6">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> If the patient is pending discharge to the home setting with a tracheostomy tube, the nurse should ensure that suction and other appropriate equipment is in place in the home prior to discharge. The nurse also educates the patient and family about daily care, including techniques to prevent infection, as well as measures to take in an emergency. The nurse provides the patient and family with a list of community contacts for education and support needs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Continuing and Transitional Care.</strong></span> A referral for home, community-based, or transitional care is indicated for ongoing assessment of the patient and of the ability of the patient and family to provide appropriate and safe care. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to cope with the physical changes and psychological issues associated with having a tracheostomy. Minimizing the amount of dust or particles in the air and providing adequate humidification may make it easier for the patient to breathe. Dust and particles in the air can be decreased by removing drapes and upholstered furniture; using air filters; and washing floors, dusting, and vacuuming frequently. The nurse identifies resources and makes referrals for appropriate services to assist the patient and family to manage the tracheostomy tube at home.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mechanical Ventilation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical ventilation may be required to manage acute respiratory failure. It may also be indicated for a variety of other reasons including to: control the patient&#x2019;s respirations during surgery or treatment, oxygenate the blood when the patient&#x2019;s ventilatory efforts are inadequate, and rest the respiratory muscles. Many patients placed on a ventilator can breathe spontaneously, although the effort needed to do so may be exhausting.</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mechanical ventilator:&lt;/b&gt; a positive- or negative-pressure breathing device that supports ventilation and oxygenation">mechanical ventilator</button></strong> is a positive- or negative-pressure breathing device that can maintain ventilation and oxygen delivery for a prolonged period.</p>
<p class="h7">Indications</p>
<p class="nonindent">If a patient has evidence of respiratory failure or a compromised airway, ET intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated. This clinical evidence may be corroborated by a continuous decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub>, an increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and a persistent acidosis (decreased pH); however, if the patient&#x2019;s status appears emergent, then waiting for these laboratory results prior to ensuring these ventilator support measures is imprudent. Conditions such as thoracic or abdominal surgery, drug overdose, neuromuscular disorders, inhalation injury, COPD, multiple trauma, shock, multisystem failure, and coma may lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. General indications for mechanical ventilation are displayed in <a href="#ct19-14">Chart&#x00A0;19-14</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Classification of Ventilators</p>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical ventilators were traditionally classified according to the method by which they supported ventilation. The two general categories are negative- and positive-pressure ventilators. <a href="#ff19-7">Figure&#x00A0;19-7</a> displays commonly used positive-pressure ventilators. Negative-pressure ventilators (e.g., &#x201C;iron lungs,&#x201D; chest cuirass) are older modes of ventilatory support that are rarely utilized today.</p>
<p class="h8">Positive-Pressure Ventilators</p>
<p class="nonindent">Positive-pressure ventilators inflate the lungs by exerting positive pressure on the airway, pushing air in, similar to a bellows mechanism, and forcing the alveoli to expand during inspiration. Expiration occurs passively. ET intubation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page560" title="560"></span>or tracheostomy is usually necessary. These ventilators are widely used in the hospital setting and are increasingly used in the home for patients with primary lung disease. Three types of positive-pressure ventilators are classified by the method of ending the inspiratory phase of respiration: volume-cycled, pressure-cycled, and high-frequency oscillatory support. The fourth type, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV), does not require intubation (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Volume-Cycled Ventilators.</strong></span> Volume-cycled ventilators deliver a preset volume of air with each inspiration. Once this preset volume is delivered to the patient, the ventilator cycles off and exhalation occurs passively. From breath to breath, the volume of air delivered by the ventilator is relatively constant, ensuring consistent, adequate breaths despite varying airway pressures. A major disadvantage to using volume-cycled ventilators is that patients may experience barotrauma (trauma to the trachea or alveoli secondary to positive pressure) because the pressures required to deliver the breaths may be excessive. This trauma causes damage to the alveolar capillary membrane and air to leak into the surrounding tissues (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Pressure-Cycled Ventilators.</strong></span> When the pressure-cycled ventilator cycles on, it delivers a flow of air (inspiration) until it reaches a preset pressure, and then cycles off, and expiration occurs. The major limitation is the volume of air or oxygen can vary as the patient&#x2019;s airway resistance or compliance changes. As a result, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tidal volume:&lt;/b&gt; volume of air inspired and expired with each breath during normal breathing">tidal volume</button></strong> delivered (i.e., volume of air inspired and expired with each breath) may be inconsistent, possibly compromising ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>High-Frequency Oscillatory Support Ventilators.</strong></span> These types of ventilators deliver very high respiratory rates (i.e., 180 to 900 breaths/min) that are accompanied by very low tidal volumes and high airway pressures (hence the name <em>high-frequency oscillatory support</em>). These small pulses of oxygen-enriched air move down the center of the airways, allowing alveolar air to exit the lungs along the margins of the airways. This ventilatory mode is used to open the alveoli in situations characterized by closed small airways, such as atelectasis and ARDS and it is also thought to protect the lung from pressure injury (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Noninvasive Positive-Pressure Ventilation.</strong></span> NIPPV is a method of positive-pressure ventilation that can be given via facemasks that cover the nose and mouth, nasal masks, or other oral or nasal devices such as the nasal pillow (a small nasal cannula that seals around the nares to maintain the prescribed pressure). NIPPV eliminates the need for ET intubation or tracheostomy and decreases the risk of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia. The most comfortable mode for the patient is pressure-controlled ventilation with pressure support. This eases the work of breathing and enhances gas exchange. The ventilator can be set with a minimum backup rate for patients with periods of apnea.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients are candidates for NIPPV if they have acute or chronic respiratory failure, acute pulmonary edema, COPD, chronic heart failure, or a sleep-related breathing disorder. The technique also may be used at home to improve tissue oxygenation and to rest the respiratory muscles while patients sleep at night. NIPPV is contraindicated for those who have experienced respiratory arrest, serious arrhythmias, cognitive impairment, or head or facial trauma. NIPPV may also be used for obstructive sleep apnea, for patients at the end of life, and for those who do not want ET intubation but may need short- or long-term ventilatory support (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</strong> provides positive pressure to the airways throughout the respiratory cycle. Although it can be used as an adjunct to mechanical ventilation with a cuffed ET tube or tracheostomy tube to open the alveoli, it is also used with a leak-proof mask to keep alveoli open, thereby preventing respiratory failure. CPAP is an effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea because the positive pressure acts as a splint, keeping the upper airway and trachea open during sleep. To use CPAP, the patient must be breathing independently.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)</strong> ventilation offers independent control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures while providing pressure support ventilation (PSV). It delivers two levels of positive airway pressure provided via a nasal or oral mask, nasal pillow, or mouthpiece with a tight seal and a portable ventilator. Each inspiration can be initiated either by the patient or by the machine if it is programmed with a backup rate. The backup rate ensures that the patient receives a set number of breaths per minute. BiPAP is most often used for patients who require ventilatory assistance at night, such as those with severe COPD or sleep apnea. Tolerance is variable; BiPAP usually is most successful with patients who are highly motivated.</p>
<p class="h7">Ventilator Modes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ventilator mode refers to how breaths are delivered to the patient. The most commonly used modes are controlled mechanical ventilation, continuous mandatory ventilation, also known as assist&#x2013;control (A/C), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), PSV, and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) (see <a href="#ff19-8">Fig.&#x00A0;19-8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Controlled mechanical ventilation provides full ventilator support by delivering a preset tidal volume and respiratory rate. This mode of ventilation is indicated for patients who are apneic. In A/C ventilation, more commonly called <strong>continuous mandatory (volume or pressure) ventilation (CMV)</strong>, the ventilator delivers a preset tidal volume or pressure at a preset rate of respirations. However, if the patient initiates a breath between the machine&#x2019;s breaths, the ventilator delivers at the preset volume or pressure (assisted breath). Therefore, every breath is the preset volume or pressure, regardless of whether it is initiated by the patient or the ventilator. Two variations to CMV include: pressure-regulated volume control ventilation (PRVCV) and pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (PC-IRV). PRVCV delivers a preset tidal volume using the minimal amount of airway pressure in patients with rapidly changing airway resistance and lung compliance. PC-IRV provides prolonged inspiratory time in refractory to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in a patient with hypoxia.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Intermittent mandatory (volume or pressure) ventilation (IMV)</strong> provides a combination of mechanically assisted breaths and spontaneous breaths. Mechanical breaths are delivered at preset intervals and a preselected tidal volume, regardless of the patient&#x2019;s efforts. Although the patient can increase the respiratory rate by initiating inspiration between ventilator-delivered breaths, these spontaneous breaths are limited to the tidal volume generated by the patient. IMV allows patients to use their own muscles for ventilation to help prevent muscle atrophy. It lowers mean airway pressure, which can assist in preventing barotrauma. However, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, evidenced by the patient &#x201C;fighting the ventilator&#x201D; or &#x201C;bucking the ventilator&#x201D; (i.e., trying to exhale when the ventilator is delivering a breath) may increase.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)</strong> also delivers a preset tidal volume and number of breaths per minute. Between ventilator-delivered breaths, the patient can breathe spontaneously with no assistance from the ventilator on those extra breaths. Because the ventilator senses patient breathing efforts and does not initiate a breath in opposition to the patient&#x2019;s efforts, patient-ventilator dyssynchrony is reduced. As the patient&#x2019;s ability to breathe spontaneously increases, the preset number of ventilator breaths is decreased and the patient does more of the work of breathing. Like IMV, SIMV can be used to provide full or partial ventilatory support. Nursing interventions for patients receiving IMV or SIMV include monitoring progress by recording respiratory rate, minute volume, spontaneous and machine-generated tidal volume, FiO<sub>2</sub>, and arterial blood gas levels.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Pressure support ventilation (PSV)</strong> applies a pressure plateau to the airway throughout the patient-triggered inspiration to decrease resistance within the tracheal tube and ventilator tubing. Pressure support is reduced gradually as the patient&#x2019;s strength increases. An SIMV backup rate may be added for extra support. The nurse must closely observe the patient&#x2019;s respiratory rate and tidal volumes on initiation of PSV. It may be necessary to adjust the pressure support to avoid tachypnea or large tidal volumes.</p>
<p class="indent">An additional mode of ventilation used to facilitate weaning is volume-assisted pressure support ventilation (VAPSV) also referred to as pressure augmentation (PA). This mode of ventilation ensures the patient receives a minimum tidal volume with each pressure support breath.</p>
<p class="indent">A newer mode of ventilation which requires an esophageal catheter to monitor electrical activity of the diaphragm is neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). This mode delivers assisted breaths in synchrony with the patient&#x2019;s own breath. The esophageal catheter monitors electrical activity of the diaphragm and signals the ventilator when to initiate a breath.</p>
<p class="indent">Another unique mode of ventilation used in special circumstances is independent lung ventilation (ILV). This mode is used in patients with unilateral lung disease. Each lung is ventilated separately via a double lumen ET tube (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)</strong> is a time-triggered, pressure-limited, time-cycled mode of mechanical ventilation that allows unrestricted, spontaneous breathing throughout the ventilatory cycle. The inflation period is long, and breaths may be initiated spontaneously as well as by the ventilator. APRV allows alveolar gas to be expelled through the lungs&#x2019; natural recoil. APRV has the important advantages of causing less ventilator-induced lung injury and fewer adverse effects on cardiocirculatory function and being associated with lower need for sedation and neuromuscular blockade.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Proportional assist ventilation (PAV)</strong> provides partial ventilatory support in which the ventilator generates pressure in proportion to the patient&#x2019;s inspiratory efforts. With every breath, the ventilator synchronizes with the patient&#x2019;s ventilatory efforts. The more inspiratory pressure the patient generates, the more pressure the ventilator generates, amplifying the patient&#x2019;s inspiratory effort without any specific preselected target pressure or volume. It generally adds &#x201C;additional muscle&#x201D; to the patient&#x2019;s effort; the depth and frequency of breaths are controlled by the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Other modes of mechanical ventilation that incorporate computerized control of ventilation include adaptive support ventilation (ASV), which adjusts minute ventilation and pressure support based on patient need (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">With various modes of mechanical ventilation, the ventilator constantly monitors many variables and adjusts gas delivery during individual breaths; these within-breath adjustment systems include automatic tube compensation, volume-ensured pressure support, and proportional support ventilation. In other modes, the ventilator evaluates gas delivery during one breath and uses that information to adjust the next breath; these between-breath adjustment systems can be made to ensure a preset tidal volume by adjusting pressure, up to a preset maximum, and include pressure volume support, pressure-regulated volume control, and ASV.</p>
<p class="h7">Adjusting the Ventilator</p>
<p class="nonindent">The ventilator is adjusted so that the patient is comfortable and breathes synchronously (i.e., &#x201C;in sync&#x201D;) with the machine. Minimal alteration of the normal cardiovascular and pulmonary dynamics is desired. If the volume ventilator is adjusted appropriately, the patient&#x2019;s arterial blood gas values will be satisfactory and there will be little or no cardiovascular compromise. <a href="#ct19-15">Chart&#x00A0;19-15</a> describes initial ventilator settings.</p>

<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse8"><strong>The Patient Receiving Mechanical Ventilation</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing management of patients with acute respiratory failure includes assisting with intubation and maintaining mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, caring for a patient on mechanical ventilation has become an integral part of nursing care for many patients in critical care or general medical-surgical units, extended care facilities, and the home. Nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists must understand each patient&#x2019;s specific pulmonary needs and work together to set realistic goals. Positive patient outcomes depend on an understanding of the principles of mechanical ventilation and the patient&#x2019;s care needs as well as open communication among members of the health care team about the goals of therapy, weaning plans, and the patient&#x2019;s tolerance of changes in ventilator settings.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse plays a vital role in assessing the patient&#x2019;s status and the functioning of the ventilator. In assessing the patient, the nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s physiologic status and how they are coping with mechanical ventilation. Physical assessment includes systematic assessment of all body systems, with an in-depth focus on the respiratory system. Respiratory assessment includes vital signs, respiratory rate and pattern, breath sounds, evaluation of spontaneous ventilatory effort, and potential evidence of hypoxia (e.g., skin color). Increased adventitious breath sounds may indicate a need for suctioning. The nurse maintains the patient&#x2019;s head of the bed so that it is elevated 30 degrees or higher unless contraindicated to prevent the risk of aspiration and VAP. The nurse verifies endotracheal tube position as applicable and evaluates the settings and functioning of the mechanical ventilator. Although the nurse may not be primarily responsible for adjusting the settings on the ventilator or measuring ventilator parameters (these are usually responsibilities of the respiratory therapist), the nurse is responsible for the patient and therefore needs to evaluate how the ventilator affects the patient&#x2019;s overall status.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When monitoring the ventilator, the nurse notes the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Controlling mode (e.g., CMV ventilation and SIMV).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Tidal volume and rate settings (tidal volume is usually set at 6 to 10 mL/kg [ideal body weight] or 4 to 8 mL/kg for the patient with ARDS [ideal body weight]; rate is usually set at 12 to 16 breaths/min).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>FiO<sub>2</sub> setting may be set between 21% and 100% to maintain an optimal PaO<sub>2</sub> level (e.g., greater than 60 mm Hg) or SpO<sub>2</sub> level greater than 92%.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) (normal is 15 to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; this increases if there is increased airway resistance or decreased compliance).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sensitivity (A 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O inspiratory force should trigger the ventilator).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (usually 1:2 [1 second of inspiration to 2 seconds of expiration] unless inverse ratio is ordered).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Minute volume (tidal volume &#x00D7; respiratory rate).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sigh settings (usually set at 1.5 times the tidal volume and ranging from 1 to 3 per hour), if applicable.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Water in the tubing, disconnection or kinking of the tubing, which, if present, are corrected.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Humidification (humidifier filled with water) and temperature.</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>PEEP and pressure support level, if applicable.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">As is true with any type of patient-sensitive life support equipment, mechanical ventilators have multiple alarms that are set to alert the health care team of potential patient problems. With the increased number of alarms and their high sensitivity to subtle changes, members of the health care team, including nurses, are at risk for experiencing alarm fatigue, which means that they may become desensitized to alarms and not respond to them with sufficient speed. According to the National Patient Safety Goals (TJC, 2020), measures must be instituted to prevent alarm fatigue.</p>

</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Assessment also addresses the patient&#x2019;s neurologic status and effectiveness of coping with the need for assisted ventilation and the changes that accompany it. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s comfort level and ability to communicate as well. Because weaning from mechanical ventilation requires adequate nutrition, it is important to assess the patient&#x2019;s gastrointestinal system and nutritional status.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include achievement of optimal gas exchange, maintenance of a patent airway, absence of injury or infection, attainment of optimal mobility, adjustment to nonverbal methods of communication, acquisition of successful coping measures, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing care of the patient who is mechanically ventilated requires expert technical and interpersonal skills. Nursing interventions are similar regardless of the setting; however, the frequency of interventions and the stability of the patient vary from setting to setting. Nursing interventions for the patient who is mechanically ventilated are not uniquely different from those for patients with other pulmonary disorders, but astute nursing assessment and a therapeutic nurse&#x2013;patient relationship are critical. The specific interventions used by the nurse are determined by the underlying disease process and the patient&#x2019;s response.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 564</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page565" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="565">p. 565</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Two general nursing interventions that are important in the care of the patient who is mechanically ventilated are pulmonary auscultation and interpretation of arterial blood gas measurements. The nurse is often the first to note changes in physical assessment findings or significant trends in blood gases that signal the development of a serious problem (e.g., pneumothorax, tube displacement, pulmonary embolus).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> G<small>AS</small> E<small>XCHANGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The purpose of mechanical ventilation is to optimize gas exchange by maintaining alveolar ventilation and oxygen delivery. The alteration in gas exchange may be caused by the underlying illness or by mechanical factors related to adjustment of the ventilator to the patient. The health care team, including the nurse, physician, and respiratory therapist, continually assesses the patient for adequate gas exchange, signs and symptoms of hypoxia, and response to treatment. Therefore, the nursing diagnosis of impaired gas exchange is, by its complex nature, multidisciplinary and collaborative. The team members must share goals and information freely. All other goals directly or indirectly relate to this primary goal.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing interventions to promote optimal gas exchange include judicious administration of analgesic agents to relieve pain without suppressing the respiratory drive and frequent repositioning to diminish the pulmonary effects of immobility. The nurse also monitors for adequate fluid balance by assessing for the presence of peripheral edema, calculating daily intake and output, and monitoring daily weights. The nurse administers medications prescribed to control the primary disease and monitors for their side effects.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> E<small>FFECTIVE</small> A<small>IRWAY</small> C<small>LEARANCE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Continuous positive-pressure ventilation increases the production of secretions regardless of the patient&#x2019;s underlying condition. The nurse assesses for the presence of secretions by lung auscultation at least every 2 to 4 hours. Measures to clear the airway of secretions include suctioning, CPT, frequent position changes, and increased mobility as soon as possible. Frequency of suctioning should be determined by patient assessment. If excessive secretions are identified by inspection or auscultation techniques, suctioning should be performed. Sputum is not produced continuously or every 1 to 2 hours but as a response to a pathologic condition. Therefore, there is no rationale for routine suctioning of all patients every 1 to 2 hours. Although suctioning is used to aid in the clearance of secretions, it can damage the airway mucosa and impair cilia action.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The sigh mechanism on the ventilator may be adjusted to deliver at least 1 to 3 sighs per hour at 1.5 times the tidal volume if the patient is receiving A/C ventilation. Periodic sighs prevent atelectasis and the further retention of secretions. Because of the risk for hyperventilation and trauma to pulmonary tissue from excess ventilator pressure (barotrauma, pneumothorax), the sigh feature is not used frequently. If the SIMV mode is being used, the mandatory ventilations act as sighs because they are of greater volume than the patient&#x2019;s spontaneous breaths.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Humidification of the airway via the ventilator is maintained to help liquefy secretions so that they are more easily removed. Bronchodilators may be indicated to dilate the bronchioles in patients with acute lung injury or COPD and are classified as adrenergic or anticholinergic. Adrenergic bronchodilators (see <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#tt20-4">Table&#x00A0;20-4</a>) are mostly inhaled and work by stimulating the beta-receptor sites, mimicking the effects of epinephrine in the body. The desired effect is smooth muscle relaxation, which dilates the constricted bronchial tubes. Anticholinergic bronchodilators (see <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#tt20-4">Table&#x00A0;20-4</a>) produce airway relaxation by blocking cholinergic-induced bronchoconstriction. Patients receiving bronchodilator therapy of either type should be monitored for adverse effects, including dizziness, nausea, decreased oxygen saturation, hypokalemia, increased heart rate, and urine retention. Mucolytic agents (e.g., acetylcysteine) may also be indicated in these patients to liquefy secretions so that they are more easily mobilized. Nursing management of patients receiving mucolytic therapy includes assessment of an adequate cough reflex, sputum characteristics, and (in patients not receiving mechanical ventilation) improvement in incentive spirometry. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, stomatitis (oral ulcers), urticaria, and rhinorrhea (runny nose) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Karch, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> I<small>NJURY AND</small> I<small>NFECTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Maintaining the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is an essential part of airway management. Cuff pressure is monitored every 8 hours to maintain the pressure at 20 to 25 mm Hg (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>). The nurse assesses for the presence of a cuff leak at the same time. The nurse positions the ventilator tubing so that there is minimal pulling or distortion of the tube in the trachea, reducing the risk of trauma to the trachea. Unintentional or premature removal of the tube is a potentially life-threatening complication of endotracheal intubation. Removal of the tube is a frequent problem in intensive care units (ICUs) and occurs mainly during nursing care or by the patient. Nurses must instruct and remind patients and family members about the purpose of the tube and the dangers of removing it. Baseline and ongoing assessment of the patient and of the equipment ensures effective care. Providing comfort measures, including opioid analgesia and sedation, can improve the patient&#x2019;s tolerance of the endotracheal tube.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Inadvertent removal of an endotracheal tube can cause laryngeal swelling, hypoxemia, bradycardia, hypotension, and even death. Measures must be taken to prevent premature or inadvertent removal.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">To prevent tube removal by the patient, the nurse should explain to the patient and family the purpose of the tube, distract the patient through one-to-one interaction or with television, and maintain comfort measures. If the patient cannot move the arms and hands to the endotracheal tube, restraints are not needed. If the patient is alert, oriented, able to follow directions, and cooperative to the point that it is highly unlikely that they will remove the endotracheal tube, restraints are not needed. However, if the nurse determines there is a risk that the patient may try to remove the tube, the least invasive method of restraints (e.g., soft wrist restraints and hand mitts) may be appropriate as prescribed by the primary provider (check agency policy) (TJC, 2019). The rationale for use of restraints should be documented, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page566" title="566"></span>the patient&#x2019;s significant others should receive explanations why restraints are necessary. Close monitoring of the patient is essential to ensure safety and prevent harm.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients with an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube do not have the normal defenses of the upper airway. In addition, these patients frequently have multiple additional body system disturbances that lead to immune compromise. Tracheostomy care is performed at least every 8 hours, and more frequently if needed, because of the increased risk of infection. The ventilator circuit tubing and in-line suction tubing are replaced periodically, according to infection prevention guidelines, to decrease the risk of infection.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse administers oral hygiene frequently because the oral cavity is a primary source of contamination of the lungs in the patient who is intubated. The presence of a nasogastric tube in the patient who is intubated can increase the risk of aspiration, leading to nosocomial pneumonia. The nurse positions the patient with the head elevated above the stomach as much as possible. <a href="c19-sec04.xhtml#ct19-6">Chart&#x00A0;19-6</a> provides an overview of strategies to prevent VAP.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> O<small>PTIMAL</small> L<small>EVEL OF</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Being connected to a ventilator limits the patient&#x2019;s mobility. Immobility in patients who are mechanically ventilated is associated with decreases in muscle strength and increases length of hospital stay, as well as increased mortality rates (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Hodgson, Capell, &#x0026; Tipping, 2018</a>). The nurse helps the patient whose condition has become stable to get out of bed and move to a chair as soon as possible. If the patient is unable to get out of bed, the nurse encourages performance of active range-of-motion exercises at least every 6 to 8 hours. If the patient cannot perform these exercises, the nurse performs passive range-of-motion exercises at least every 8 hours to prevent contractures and venous stasis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> O<small>PTIMAL</small> C<small>OMMUNICATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">It is important to develop alternative methods of communication for the patient who is receiving mechanical ventilation. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s communication abilities to evaluate for limitations. Questions to consider when assessing the ability of the patient who is ventilator dependent to communicate include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the patient conscious and able to communicate? Can the patient nod or shake their head?</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the patient&#x2019;s mouth unobstructed by the tube so that words can be mouthed?</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the patient&#x2019;s dominant hand strong and available for writing? For example, if the patient is right handed, the IV line should be placed in the left arm if possible so that the right hand is free.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the patient a candidate for a fenestrated tracheostomy tube or a one-way speaking valve (such as Passy-Muir valve<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> or Olympic Trach-Talk<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>) that permits talking?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Once the patient&#x2019;s limitations are known, the nurse offers several appropriate communication approaches: lip or speech reading (use single key words), pad and pencil or Magic Slate<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>, iPad<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> or tablet, communication board, gesturing, sign language, or electric larynx. The use of a &#x201C;talking&#x201D; or fenestrated tracheostomy tube or one-way valve may be suggested to the primary provider, which would allow the patient to talk while on the ventilator. The nurse makes sure that the patient&#x2019;s eyeglasses, hearing aid, sign interpreter, and language translator are available if needed to enhance the patient&#x2019;s ability to communicate.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Some communication methods may be frustrating to the patient, family, and nurse; these need to be identified and minimized. A speech therapist can assist in determining the most appropriate method.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> C<small>OPING</small> A<small>BILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Dependence on a ventilator is frightening to both the patient and the family and disrupts even the most stable families. Encouraging the family to verbalize their feelings about the ventilator, the patient&#x2019;s condition, and the environment in general is beneficial. Explaining procedures every time they are performed helps reduce anxiety and familiarizes the patient with ventilator procedures. To restore a sense of control, the nurse encourages the patient to use alternative methods of communication in order to participate in decisions about care, schedules, and treatment when possible. The patient may become withdrawn or depressed while receiving mechanical ventilation, especially if its use is prolonged. To promote effective coping, the nurse informs the patient about progress when appropriate. It is important to provide diversions such as watching television, playing music, or taking a walk (if appropriate and possible). Stress reduction techniques (e.g., a back rub, relaxation measures) relieve tension and help the patient deal with anxieties and fears about both the condition and the dependence on the ventilator.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Alterations in Cardiac Function.</span> Alterations in cardiac output may occur as a result of positive-pressure ventilation. The positive intrathoracic pressure during inspiration compresses the heart and great vessels, thereby reducing venous return and cardiac output. This is usually corrected during exhalation when the positive pressure is off. The patient may have decreased cardiac output and resultant decreased tissue perfusion and oxygenation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">To evaluate cardiac function, the nurse first observes for signs and symptoms of hypoxia (restlessness, apprehension, confusion, tachycardia, tachypnea, pallor progressing to cyanosis, diaphoresis, transient hypertension, and decreased urine output). If a pulmonary artery catheter is in place, cardiac output, cardiac index, and other hemodynamic values can be used to assess the patient&#x2019;s status (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Barotrauma and Pneumothorax.</span> Excessive positive pressure can cause lung damage, or barotrauma, which may result in a spontaneous pneumothorax, which may quickly develop into a tension pneumothorax, further compromising venous return, cardiac output, and blood pressure (see later discussion). The nurse considers any sudden changes in oxygen saturation or the onset of respiratory distress to be a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate action.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Pulmonary Infection.</span> The patient is at high risk for infection, as described earlier. The nurse reports fever or a change in the color or odor of sputum to the primary provider for follow-up (see earlier discussion of VAP). Subglottic secretions may increase the patients&#x2019; risk for the development of VAP. Patients expected to be intubated for longer than 72&#x00A0;hours may benefit from the use of an endotracheal tube with a subglottic suction port. This extra port that is connected to continuous suction (20 to 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) allows for the removal of secretions above the cuff (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page567" title="567"></span><span class="spanheadh4">Delirium and Postintensive Care Syndrome.</span> Patients who are critically ill are at risk for delirium during their time in the ICU. They are also at risk for cognitive impairment at a level consistent with mild dementia that may persist for months after they are discharged to the home setting. This critical illness-associated cognitive impairment is called postintensive care syndrome (PICS). The <em>A</em>wakening and <em>B</em>reathing <em>C</em>oordination, <em>D</em>elirium monitoring and management, <em>E</em>arly mobility, <em>F</em>amily engagement and empowerment (ABCDEF) bundle proposes an interdisciplinary process using evidence-based practice to manage delirium and weakness in the patient who is critically ill. It is believed that implementing this bundle can mitigate risks for delirium and possibly PICS. The goals of this bundle are to improve communication among members of the health care team, standardize care related to the assessment and use of sedation, provide nonpharmacologic interventions in the management of delirium, provide early exercise and ambulation, and incorporate family&#x2019;s concerns and participation in care planning (see <a href="#ct19-16">Chart&#x00A0;19-16</a>) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1516">Marra, Ely, Pandharipande, et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Increasingly, patients are being cared for in extended care facilities or at home while receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tracheostomy tube, or receiving oxygen therapy. Patients receiving home ventilator care usually have a chronic neuromuscular condition or COPD. Providing the opportunity for patients who are ventilator dependent to return home to live with their families in familiar surroundings can be a positive experience. The ultimate goal of home ventilator therapy is to enhance the patient&#x2019;s quality of life, not simply to support or prolong life.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Caring for the patient with mechanical ventilator support at home can be accomplished successfully. A home or transitional care team consisting of the nurse, physician, respiratory therapist, social service or home care agency, and equipment supplier is needed. The home is evaluated to determine whether the electrical equipment needed can be operated safely. <a href="#ct19-17">Chart&#x00A0;19-17</a> summarizes the basic assessment criteria needed for successful home care.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Once the decision to initiate mechanical ventilation at home is made, the nurse prepares the patient and family for home care. The nurse educates the patient and family about the ventilator, suctioning, tracheostomy care, signs of pulmonary infection, cuff inflation and deflation, and assessment of vital signs. Education begins in the hospital and continues at home. Nursing responsibilities include evaluating the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s understanding of the information presented.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse educates the family about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including mouth-to-tracheostomy tube (instead of mouth-to-mouth) breathing. The family is also instructed how to handle a power failure, which usually involves <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page568" title="568"></span>converting the ventilator from an electrical power source to a battery power source. Conversion is automatic in most types of home ventilators and lasts approximately 1 hour. In addition, instructions are provided on the use of a manual self-inflation bag, should it be necessary. <a href="#ct19-18">Chart&#x00A0;19-18</a> lists some of the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s responsibilities.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Weaning the Patient from the Ventilator</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;respiratory weaning:&lt;/b&gt; process of gradual, systematic withdrawal or removal of ventilator, breathing tube, and oxygen">Respiratory weaning</button></strong>, the process of withdrawing the patient from dependence on the ventilator, takes place in three stages: the patient is gradually removed from the ventilator, then from either the ET or tracheostomy tube, and finally from oxygen. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is performed at the earliest possible time consistent with patient safety. The decision must be made from a physiologic rather than a mechanical viewpoint. A thorough understanding of the patient&#x2019;s clinical status is required in making this decision. Weaning is started when the patient is physiologically and hemodynamically stable, demonstrates spontaneous breathing capability, recovering from the acute stage of medical and surgical problems, and when the cause of respiratory failure is sufficiently reversed (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>). <a href="#ct19-19">Chart&#x00A0;19-19</a> presents information about patient care during weaning from mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Successful weaning involves collaboration among the primary provider, respiratory therapist, and nurse. Each health care provider must understand the scope and function of other team members in relation to patient weaning to conserve the patient&#x2019;s strength, use resources efficiently, and maximize successful outcomes.</p>
<p class="h7">Criteria for Weaning</p>
<p class="nonindent">Careful assessment is required to determine whether the patient is ready to be removed from mechanical ventilation. If the patient is stable and showing signs of improvement or reversal of the disease or condition that caused the need for mechanical ventilation, weaning indices should be assessed (see <a href="#ct19-19">Chart&#x00A0;19-19</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Stable vital signs and arterial blood gases are also important predictors of successful weaning. Once readiness has been determined, the nurse records baseline measurements of weaning indices to monitor progress.</p>
<p class="h7">Patient Preparation</p>
<p class="nonindent">To maximize the likelihood of success of weaning, the nurse must consider the patient as a whole, taking into account factors that impair the delivery of oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide as well as those that increase oxygen demand (e.g., sepsis, seizures, thyroid imbalances) or decrease the patient&#x2019;s overall strength (e.g., inadequate nutrition, neuromuscular disease). Adequate psychological preparation is necessary before and during the weaning process.</p>
<p class="h7">Methods of Weaning</p>
<p class="nonindent">Successful weaning depends on the combination of adequate patient preparation, available equipment, and an interdisciplinary approach to solve patient problems (see <a href="#ct19-19">Chart&#x00A0;19-19</a>). All usual modes of ventilation can be used for weaning.</p>
<p class="indent">CPAP (also known as spontaneous mode ventilation in this context) allows the patient to breathe spontaneously while applying positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle to keep the alveoli open and promote oxygenation. Providing CPAP during spontaneous breathing also offers the advantage of an alarm system and may reduce patient anxiety if the patient has been taught that the machine is keeping track of breathing. It also maintains lung volumes and improves the patient&#x2019;s oxygenation status. CPAP is often used in conjunction with PSV. Nurses should carefully assess for tachypnea, tachycardia, reduced tidal volumes, decreasing oxygen saturations, and increasing carbon dioxide levels.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Care of the Patient Being Weaned from Mechanical Ventilation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>Assess patient for weaning criteria:</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>a.</strong></span>Vital capacity: 10 to 15 mL/kg</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>b.</strong></span>Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) at least &#x2013;20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>c.</strong></span>Tidal volume: 7 to 9 mL/kg</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>d.</strong></span>Minute ventilation: 6 L/min</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>e.</strong></span>Rapid/shallow breathing index: Below 100 breaths/min/L; PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x003E;60 mm Hg with FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x003C;40%</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>Monitor activity level, assess dietary intake, and monitor results of laboratory tests of nutritional status. Reestablishing independent spontaneous ventilation can be physically exhausting. It is crucial that the patient have enough energy reserves to succeed.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>Assess the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s understanding of the weaning process and address any concerns about the process. Explain that the patient may feel short of breath initially and provide encouragement as needed. Reassure the patient that they will be attended closely and that if the weaning attempt is not successful, it can be tried again later.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>4.</strong></span>Implement the weaning method as prescribed (e.g., continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and T-piece).</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>5.</strong></span>Monitor vital signs, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, and respiratory pattern constantly for the first 20 to 30 minutes and every 5 minutes after that until weaning is complete. Monitoring the patient closely provides ongoing indications of success or failure.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>6.</strong></span>Maintain a patent airway; monitor arterial blood gas levels and pulmonary function tests. Suction the airway as needed.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>7.</strong></span>In collaboration with the primary provider, terminate the weaning process if adverse reactions occur. These include a heart rate increase of 20 bpm, systolic blood pressure increase of 20 mm Hg, a decrease in oxygen saturation to &#x003C;90%, respiratory rate &#x003C;8 or &#x003E;20 breaths/min, ventricular arrhythmias, fatigue, panic, cyanosis, erratic or labored breathing, paradoxical chest movement.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>8.</strong></span>If the weaning process continues, measure tidal volume and minute ventilation every 20 to 30 minutes; compare with the patient&#x2019;s desired values, which have been determined in collaboration with the primary provider.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Last"><span class="numah"><strong>9.</strong></span>Assess for psychological dependence if the physiologic parameters indicate that weaning is feasible and the patient still resists. Possible causes of psychological dependence include fear of dying and depression from chronic illness. It is important to address this issue before the next weaning attempt.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">SIMV can also be used as a weaning method. The patient is placed on SIMV mode of ventilation and the rate is slowly decreased by 1 to 3 breaths/min until the patient is fully breathing on their own (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, T-piece spontaneous breathing trials can also be used. When the patient can breathe spontaneously, weaning trials using a T-piece for the patient with an ET tube or tracheostomy mask for the patient with a tracheostomy tube (see <a href="#ff19-6">Fig.&#x00A0;19-6</a>) are normally conducted with the patient disconnected from the ventilator, receiving humidified oxygen only and performing all work of breathing. Because patients do not have to overcome the resistance of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page570" title="570"></span>the ventilator, they may find this mode more comfortable, or they may become anxious as they breathe with no support from the ventilator. During these trial periods, the nurse monitors the patient closely and provides encouragement. This method of weaning is usually used when the patient is awake and alert, is breathing without difficulty, has good gag and cough reflexes, and is hemodynamically stable. During the weaning process, the patient is maintained on the same or a higher oxygen concentration than when receiving mechanical ventilation. While the patient is using the T-piece or tracheostomy mask, they are observed for signs and symptoms of hypoxia, increasing respiratory muscle fatigue, or systemic fatigue. These include restlessness, increased respiratory rate (greater than 35 breaths/min), the use of accessory muscles, tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, and paradoxical chest movement (asynchronous breathing, chest contraction during inspiration and expansion during expiration). Fatigue or exhaustion is initially manifested by an increased respiratory rate associated with a gradual reduction in tidal volume; later there is a slowing of the respiratory rate.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient appears to be tolerating the T-piece/tracheostomy mask trial, a second set of arterial blood gas measurements is drawn 20 minutes after the patient has been on spontaneous ventilation at a constant FiO<sub>2</sub> PSV. (Alveolar&#x2013;arterial equilibration takes 15 to 20 minutes to occur.)</p>
<p class="indent">Signs of exhaustion and hypoxia correlated with deterioration in the blood gas measurements indicate the need for ventilatory support. The patient is placed back on the ventilator each time signs of fatigue or deterioration develop.</p>
<p class="indent">If clinically stable, the patient usually can be extubated within 2 or 3 hours after weaning and allowed spontaneous ventilation by means of a mask with humidified oxygen. Patients who have had prolonged ventilatory assistance usually require more gradual weaning; it may take days or even weeks. They are weaned primarily during the day and placed back on the ventilator at night to rest.</p>
<p class="indent">Because patients respond in different manners to weaning methods, there is no definitive way to assess which method is best. Regardless of the weaning method being used, ongoing assessment of respiratory status is essential to monitor patient progress.</p>
<p class="indent">Successful weaning from the ventilator is supplemented by intensive pulmonary care. The following methods are used: oxygen therapy; arterial blood gas evaluation; pulse oximetry; bronchodilator therapy; CPT; adequate nutrition, hydration, and humidification; blood pressure measurement; and incentive spirometry. Daily spontaneous breathing trials may be used to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s ability to breathe without ventilatory support. If the patient is receiving IV sedatives (e.g., propofol, dexmedetomidine), current guidelines recommend that the patient&#x2019;s sedative dose be decreased by 25% to 50% prior to weaning<em>.</em> In order to decrease agitation in patients who do not tolerate withdrawal of sedation, dexmedetomidine may be initiated for spontaneous breathing trials without causing significant respiratory depression (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1486">Devlin, Skrobik, G&#x00E9;linas, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>). A patient may still have borderline pulmonary function and need vigorous supportive therapy before their respiratory status returns to a level that supports activities of daily living.</p>
<p class="h7">Removal of the Tracheostomy Tube</p>
<p class="nonindent">Removal of the tracheostomy tube is considered when the patient can breathe spontaneously; maintain an adequate airway by effectively coughing up secretions, swallow, and move the jaw. Secretion clearance and aspiration risks are assessed to determine whether active pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are intact.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the patient can clear secretions adequately, a trial period of mouth breathing or nose breathing is conducted. This can be accomplished by several methods. The first method requires changing to a smaller size tube to increase the resistance to airflow or plugging the tracheostomy tube (deflating the cuff first). The smaller tube is sometimes replaced by a cuffless tracheostomy tube, which allows the tube to be plugged at lengthening intervals to monitor patient progress. A second method involves changing to a fenestrated tube (a tube with an opening or window in its bend). This permits air to flow around and through the tube to the upper airway and enables talking. A third method involves switching to a smaller tracheostomy button (stoma button). A tracheostomy button is a plastic tube approximately 1 inch long that helps keep the windpipe open after the larger tracheostomy tube has been removed. Finally, when the patient demonstrates the ability to maintain a patent airway, the tube can be removed. An occlusive dressing is placed over the stoma, which heals in several days to weeks.</p>
<p class="h7">Weaning from Oxygen</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient who has been successfully weaned from the ventilator, cuff, and tube and has adequate respiratory function is then weaned from oxygen. The FiO<sub>2</sub> is gradually reduced until the PaO<sub>2</sub> is in the range of 70 to 100 mm Hg while the patient is breathing room air. If the PaO<sub>2</sub> is less than 70 mm Hg on room air, supplemental oxygen is recommended. To be eligible for financial reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for in-home oxygen, the patient must have a PaO<sub>2</sub> at or less than 55 mm Hg while awake and at rest or arterial oxygen saturation at or below 88%, breathing room air (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1450">American Association of Respiratory Care, 2007</a>; CMS, 1993).</p>
<p class="h7">Nutrition</p>
<p class="nonindent">Success in weaning the patient who is long-term ventilator dependent requires early and aggressive but judicious nutritional support. The respiratory muscles (diaphragm and especially intercostals) become weak or atrophied after just a few days of mechanical ventilation and may be catabolized for energy, especially if nutrition is inadequate. Compensation for inadequate nutrition must be undertaken with care; excessive intake can increase the production of carbon dioxide and the demand for oxygen and lead to prolonged ventilator dependence and difficulty in weaning. Because the metabolism of fat produces less carbon dioxide than the metabolism of carbohydrates, it was long presumed that a high-fat and limited carbohydrate diet would be most therapeutic; however, evidence-based findings do not support its efficacy (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Seres, 2020</a>). Adequate protein intake is important in increasing respiratory muscle strength. Protein intake should be approximately 25% of total daily <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page571" title="571"></span>kilocalories, or 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/day. Daily nutrition should be closely monitored.</p>
<p class="indent">Soon after the patient is admitted, a consultation with a dietitian or nutrition support team should be arranged to plan the best form of nutritional replacement. Adequate nutrition may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and prevent other complications, especially sepsis. Sepsis can occur if bacteria enter the bloodstream and release toxins that, in turn, cause vasodilation and hypotension, fever, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and coma. Aggressive treatment of sepsis is essential to reverse this threat to survival and to promote weaning from the ventilator when the patient&#x2019;s condition improves.</p>
