<h4 class="h4" id="s2424">Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Breast assessment includes a targeted health history and physical examination.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2425">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When a patient presents with a breast problem, the nurse conducts a general health assessment, including history of medical disorders and previous surgery; family history of diseases, particularly cancer; gynecologic and obstetric history; present medications (including prescriptions, vitamins, and herbals); past and present use of hormonal contraceptives, hormone therapy (HT) (formerly referred to as hormone replacement therapy [HRT]), or fertility treatments; and social habits (e.g., smoking, drinking alcohol, illicit drug use). Psychosocial information, such as the patient&#x2019;s marital status, occupation, and availability of resources and support people, is obtained. Any recent x-rays or other diagnostic tests are noted. Focused questions pertaining to the breast disorder are asked concerning the onset of the disorder and the length of time it has been present. In addition, the patient is asked if any masses are palpable and if there is any associated pain, swelling, redness, nipple discharge, or change in the skin. Knowledge and comfort related to breast self-awareness, which can include breast self-examination (BSE), should also be ascertained from the patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2426">Physical Assessment: Female Breast</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A female breast examination can be conducted during any general physical or gynecologic examination or whenever the patient reports an abnormality. While the American Cancer Society (ACS) no longer recommends regular clinical breast examinations for average-risk women, this doesn&#x2019;t mean that the examination should never be performed. Providers may still examine women&#x2019;s breasts, offer education about breast awareness to all women, and women should get screening imaging based upon their risks (see later discussion) (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3780">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Inspection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Examination begins with inspection. The patient is asked to disrobe to the waist and sit in a comfortable position facing the examiner. The breasts are inspected for size and symmetry. A slight variation in the size of each breast is common and generally normal. The skin is inspected for color, venous pattern, thickening, or edema. Erythema (redness) may indicate benign local inflammation or superficial lymphatic invasion by a neoplasm. A prominent venous pattern can signal increased blood supply required by a tumor. Edema and pitting of the skin may result from a neoplasm blocking lymphatic drainage, giving the skin an orange peel appearance; this is called peau d&#x2019;orange&#x2014;a classic sign of advanced breast cancer. Nipple inversion of one or both breasts is not uncommon and is significant only when of recent origin. Ulceration, rashes, or spontaneous nipple discharge requires evaluation. Examples of abnormal breast findings on inspection can be found in <a href="#ct52-1">Chart&#x00A0;52-1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">To elicit skin dimpling or retraction that may otherwise go undetected, the examiner instructs the patient to raise both arms overhead. This maneuver normally elevates both breasts equally. The patient is then instructed to place her hands on her waist and push in. These movements, which cause contraction of the pectoral muscles, do not normally alter the breast contour or nipple direction. Any dimpling or retraction during these position changes suggests an underlying mass. The clavicular and axillary regions are inspected for swelling, discoloration, lesions, or enlarged lymph nodes (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Mallory &#x0026; Golshan, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Palpation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The breasts are palpated with the patient upright (sitting up) and supine (lying down). In the supine position, the patient&#x2019;s shoulder is first elevated with a small pillow to help balance the breast on the chest wall. Failure to do this allows the breast tissue to slip laterally and a breast mass may be missed. The entire surface of the breast and the axillary tail is systematically palpated using the flat part (pads) of the second, third, and fourth fingertips, held together, making dime-size circles. The examiner may choose to proceed in a clockwise direction, following imaginary concentric circles from the outer limits of the breast toward the nipple. Other acceptable methods are to palpate from each number on the face of the clock toward the nipple in a clockwise fashion or along imaginary vertical lines on the breast (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-2">Fig.&#x00A0;52-2</a></span>).</p>
<p class="indent">Palpation of the axillary and clavicular areas is easily performed with the patient seated (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-3">Fig.&#x00A0;52-3</a></span>). To examine the axillary lymph nodes, the examiner gently abducts the patient&#x2019;s arm from the thorax. With the left hand, the patient&#x2019;s right forearm is grasped and supported. The right hand is then free to palpate the axilla. Any lymph nodes that may be lying against the thoracic wall are noted. Normally, these lymph nodes are not palpable, but if they are enlarged, their location, size, mobility, and consistency are noted. During palpation, the examiner notes any patient-reported tenderness or masses. If a mass is detected, it is described by its location (e.g., right breast, 2 cm from the nipple at 2 o&#x2019;clock position). Size, shape, consistency, border delineation, and mobility are included in the description (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Mallory &#x0026; Golshan, 2018</a>). The examiner then modifies these steps to use the right hand to grasp the patient&#x2019;s left forearm, and then uses the left hand to palpate the axilla of the left breast.</p>
<p class="indent">The breast tissue of the adolescent is usually firm and lobular, whereas that of the postmenopausal woman is more likely to feel thinner and fattier. During pregnancy and lactation, the breasts are firmer and larger with lobules that are more distinct. Hormonal changes cause the areola to darken.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiii-3.jpg" alt=""/> Obesity may have a proinflammatory effect on the breast that can contribute to increased rates of atypia. Atypia in breast ductal lavage and C-reactive protein levels in the nipple are significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI). Excessive body weight, as reflected by a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, is associated with postmenopausal breast cancer and increases the risk of dying of this disease; conversely, being overweight or having obesity seems to provide protection to women aged 40 to 49 (ACS, 2019).</p>

<p class="indent">Cysts are commonly found in women who are menstruating and are usually well defined and freely movable. In the premenstrual period, cysts may be larger and more tender. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, tend to be hard, poorly defined, and nontender. A clinician should further evaluate any abnormalities detected during inspection and palpation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2427">Physical Assessment: Male Breast</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Breast cancer can occur in men. Assessment of the male breast and axilla is brief but important and should be included in a physical examination. The nipple and areola are inspected for swelling, nodules, ulcerations, and nipple discharge. The flat disc of undeveloped breast tissue under the nipple is palpated. The same procedure for palpating the female breast is used to assess the male breast (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3785">Canadian Cancer Society, 2020</a>).</p>
