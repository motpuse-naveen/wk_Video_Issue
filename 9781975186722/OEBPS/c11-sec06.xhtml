<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;distributive shock:&lt;/b&gt; shock state resulting from displacement of intravascular volume creating a relative hypovolemia and inadequate delivery of oxygen to the cells">Distributive shock</button></strong> occurs when intravascular volume pools in peripheral blood vessels. This abnormal displacement of intravascular volume causes a relative hypovolemia because not enough blood returns to the heart, which leads to inadequate tissue perfusion. The ability of the blood vessels to constrict helps return the blood to the heart. Vascular tone is determined both by central regulatory mechanisms, as in BP regulation, and by local regulatory mechanisms, such as tissue demands for oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, distributive shock can be caused by either a loss of sympathetic tone or a release of biochemical mediators from cells that causes vasodilation.</p>
<p class="indent">The varied mechanisms leading to the initial vasodilation in distributive shock provide the basis for the further subclassification of shock into three types: septic shock, neurogenic shock, and anaphylactic shock. These subtypes of distributive shock cause variations in the pathophysiologic chain of events and are explained below separately. In all types of distributive shock, massive arterial and venous dilation promotes peripheral pooling of blood. Arterial dilation reduces systemic vascular resistance. Initially, cardiac output can be high, both from the reduction in afterload (systemic vascular resistance) and from the heart muscle&#x2019;s increased effort to maintain perfusion despite the incompetent vasculature. Pooling of blood in the periphery results in decreased venous return. Decreased venous return results in decreased stroke volume and decreased cardiac output. Decreased cardiac output, in turn, causes decreased BP and ultimately decreased tissue perfusion. <a href="#ff11-7">Figure&#x00A0;11-7</a> presents the pathophysiologic sequence of events in distributive shock.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Family Participation in the Intensive Care Unit</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Wong, P., Redley, B., Digby, R., et al. (2020). Families&#x2019; perspectives of participation in patient care in an adult intensive care unit: A qualitative study. <em>Australian Critical Care, 33</em>(4), 317&#x2013;325.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The aim of this study was to describe family participation in patient care in the adult intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a qualitative, descriptive observational study that enrolled a convenience sample of 30 family members who had an adult family member admitted to the ICU for more than 72 h. Researchers observed the family members&#x2019; engagement in patient care activities and conducted semi-structured interviews focused on their experiences and perceptions of providing care.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Most of the family participants (77%) were female. Ages of the patient and family member were similar ranging from 28 to 73, with a median age for family members of 53. Researchers observed 193 activities in which 25% involved physical care for the patient, while the remaining 75% of activities were intangible care interventions such as communication and psychosocial/emotional care. Themes that emerged from the interviews revealed that the families felt part of the health care team and thus wanted to support the care and recovery of the loved one. Family members reported being motivated to provide care because they wanted the best care for the patient, desired to know the prognosis, treatment, and condition of the patient, and desired to help the patient recover. Lastly, family members wanted to advocate for their relatives, provide psychosocial and emotional care, and be supportive during medical treatments. The researchers observed that the physical environment was either a contributor or barrier to the family member&#x2019;s ability to engage in care. Equipment sometimes created physical barriers that made it hard for family to get close to the patient. Staff support and communication either encouraged or discouraged family participation in care. When nurses communicated openly, keeping families informed, family members felt more welcomed and better able to support the patient&#x2019;s treatment plans.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Most families wish to be engaged and to advocate for their loved ones in the treatment decision making process. The ability for family to feel part of the health care team and develop trust in the plan of care is influenced by positive relationships with the nursing and medical staff as well as the welcoming nature of the environment. Patient- and family-centered care is facilitated when families are considered collaborative partners in the care of adult patients who are critically ill.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s352">Sepsis and Septic Shock</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;septic shock:&lt;/b&gt; a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality">Septic shock</button></strong>, the most common type of distributive shock, is caused by widespread infection or sepsis. According to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (<em>Sepsis-3</em>) Task Force, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sepsis:&lt;/b&gt; life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection">sepsis</button></strong> is &#x201C;life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (Singer et al., 2016, p. 804),&#x201D; and <strong>septic shock</strong> is &#x201C;a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular metabolism abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality (Singer et al., 2016, p. 806).&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the increased sophistication of antibiotic therapy, the incidence of both sepsis and septic shock has continued to rise; today sepsis and septic shock are the leading causes of death in noncoronary ICU patients. Worldwide, sepsis impacts more than 31 million people, and more than 6 million people die from it annually (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib866">Global Sepsis Alliance, 2017</a>). The number of hospital admissions related to sepsis has increased threefold over the last decade (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib907">Surviving Sepsis Campaign, 2019</a>). Identifying and aggressively treating the source of infection and quickly restoring tissue perfusion are important interventions that may positively influence clinical outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hospital-acquired conditions, which may include hospital-associated infections (i.e., infections not present at the time of admission to the health care setting) in critically ill patients that may progress to septic shock, most frequently originate in the bloodstream (bacteremia), lungs (pneumonia), and urinary tract (urosepsis). Other infections include intra-abdominal infections and wound infections. Of increasing concern are bacteremias associated with intravascular catheters and indwelling urinary catheters (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib857">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 291</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page292" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="292">p. 292</span></div>
<p class="indent">Additional risk factors that contribute to the growing incidence of sepsis are the increased use of invasive procedures and indwelling medical devices, the increased number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, and the aging population (CDC, 2019). Older adult patients are at particular risk for sepsis because of decreased physiologic reserves, an aging immune system, comorbid conditions and often nonspecific presentation of infection (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rowe &#x0026; McKoy, 2017</a>) (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>). Other patients at risk are those undergoing surgical and other invasive procedures, especially patients who have undergone emergency surgery or multiple surgeries (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>); those with malnutrition or immunosuppression; and those with chronic illness such as diabetes, hepatitis, chronic kidney disease, and immunodeficiency disorders (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Keeley, Hine, &#x0026; Nsutebu, 2017</a>) (<a href="#ct11-5">Chart&#x00A0;11-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The incidence of sepsis can be reduced by using strict infection control practices, beginning with thorough hand hygiene techniques (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib864">Dunne, Kingston, Slevin, et al., 2018</a>). Other interventions include implementing programs to prevent central line infections and ventilator-associated events (e.g., aspiration) and pneumonia; ensuring early removal of invasive devices that are no longer necessary (e.g., indwelling urinary catheters); promoting early ambulation and timely d&#x00E9;bridement of wounds; and adhering to standard precautions and infection prevention/control practices, including the use of meticulous aseptic technique and proper cleaning of equipment and the patient environment.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s353">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Gram-negative bacteria traditionally were the most commonly implicated microorganisms in sepsis. However, there is an increased incidence of gram-positive bacterial infections, viral infections, and fungal infections that can also cause sepsis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Keeley et al., 2017</a>). Although a site of infection is identified in most cases, in up to 30% of patients with sepsis an identifiable source of infection is not determined (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib907">Surviving Sepsis Campaign, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When microorganisms invade body tissues, patients exhibit an immune response. This immune response provokes the activation of biochemical cytokines and mediators associated with an inflammatory response and produces a complex cascade of physiologic events that leads to poor tissue perfusion. Increased capillary permeability results in fluid seeping from the capillaries. Capillary instability and vasodilation interrupt the body&#x2019;s ability to provide adequate perfusion, oxygen, and nutrients to the tissues and cells. The widespread inflammatory response that occurs is called the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;systemic inflammatory response syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; a syndrome resulting from a clinical insult that initiates an inflammatory response that is systemic, rather than localized to the site of the insult; a type of cytokine release syndrome also referred to as cytokine storm">systemic inflammatory response syndrome</button></strong> (SIRS). SIRS, which is a type of cytokine release syndrome and is often referred to as cytokine storm, results from a clinical insult that initiates an inflammatory response that is systemic, rather than localized to the site of the insult (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of cytokine release syndrome). The insult may be a significant injury (e.g., multitrauma) or an infection (e.g., sepsis). A patient presenting with manifestations of SIRS may be exhibiting a protective inflammatory response to the initiating insult or may be exhibiting a response to infection, which may lead to sepsis. The clinical criteria used to identify SIRS, which include a temperature greater than 38.3&#x00B0;C (101&#x00B0;F) or less than 36&#x00B0;C (96.8&#x00B0;F), tachycardia, tachypnea, and a white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, less than 4000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, or greater than 10% immature WBC (bands), have been found to be not helpful in diagnosing sepsis, however (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to SIRS, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines released during the inflammatory response activate the coagulation system, which begins to form clots regardless of whether or not bleeding is present (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>). This results not only in microvascular occlusions that further disrupt cellular perfusion but also in an inappropriate consumption of clotting factors. Imbalances among the inflammatory response and the clotting and fibrinolysis cascades are considered critical elements of the devastating physiologic progression that occurs in patients with sepsis.</p>
<p class="indent">Sepsis is an evolving process that may result in septic shock and life-threatening organ dysfunction if not recognized and treated early. In the early stage of septic shock, BP may remain within normal limits, or the patient may be hypotensive but responsive to fluids. The heart rate increases, progressing to tachycardia. Hyperthermia and fever, with warm, flushed skin and bounding pulses, are present. The respiratory rate is elevated. Urinary output may remain at normal levels or decrease. GI status may be compromised, as evidenced by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased gastric motility. Hepatic dysfunction is evidenced by rising bilirubin levels and worsening coagulopathies (e.g., decreasing platelet counts). Signs of hypermetabolism include increased serum glucose and insulin resistance. Subtle changes in mental status, such as confusion or agitation, may be present. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page293" title="293"></span>The lactate level is elevated because of the maldistribution of blood. Inflammatory markers such as WBC counts, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin levels are also elevated (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As sepsis progresses, tissues become less perfused and acidotic, compensation begins to fail, and the patient begins to show signs of organ dysfunction. The cardiovascular system also begins to fail, the BP does not respond to fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agents, and signs of end-organ damage are evident (e.g., AKI, pulmonary dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, confusion progressing to nonresponsiveness). As sepsis progresses to septic shock, the BP drops and the skin becomes cool, pale, and mottled. Temperature may be normal or below normal. Heart and respiratory rates remain rapid. Urine production ceases, and multiple organ dysfunction progressing to death occurs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s354"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A significant body of research has been conducted in the past few decades that is aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by sepsis and septic shock. In 1991, 2003, 2008, 2012, and again in 2016 (i.e., <em>Sepsis-3</em>), critical-care experts systematically reevaluated the body of research and provided evidence-based recommendations for the acute management of patients with sepsis and septic shock (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib907">Surviving Sepsis Campaign, 2019</a>). Developing and implementing protocols, sepsis bundles, that focus on prevention and early detection and management of patients with sepsis have reduced the mortality of hospitalized patients (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib878">Kahn, Davis, Yabes, et al., 2019</a>). <em>Sepsis-3</em> provides an overview of key concepts and principles germane to sepsis that must be understood in order for primary providers and nurses to be able to identify and manage patients with sepsis, including the following (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Levy &#x0026; Townsend, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>As the leading cause of death from infection, sepsis must be recognized and treated promptly.</span></li>
<li><span>Sepsis is different from infection in that in sepsis there is a dysregulated host response with organ dysfunction. An infection may cause specific organ dysfunction without a dysregulated host response.</span></li>
<li><span>Sepsis is caused by an interplay between infectious pathogens and a myriad of patient-specific risks, including genetics, age, and the presence of other diseases/disorders.</span></li>
<li><span>The organ dysfunction that occurs with sepsis may not be readily apparent; on the contrary, a new onset of organ dysfunction may be caused by an unrecognized infectious process.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Research efforts are focusing on better identification and early aggressive treatment of patients with sepsis, rapid and effective restoration of tissue perfusion, evaluation and treatment of the patient&#x2019;s immune response, and treatment of dysregulation of the coagulation system that occurs with sepsis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Keeley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Makic &#x0026; Bridges, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Correction of Underlying Causes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Current treatment of sepsis and septic shock involves rapid identification and elimination of the cause of infection. Current goals are to identify and initiate treatment for patients in early sepsis within 1 hour to optimize patient outcomes (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Levy et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Levy &#x0026; Townsend, 2019</a>). Several evidence-based screening tools can be used to help identify patients for sepsis (see later discussion of assessment tools under the section Nursing Management).</p>
<p class="indent">In an effort to continue to reduce deaths from sepsis, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has identified sepsis and sepsis bundle adherence as a <em>Core Measure.</em> The focus on adherence with these evidence-based bundled interventions is to foster early recognition and interventions in patients with sepsis so that patient outcomes improve. These assessments and interventions are collectively referred to as the <em>Sepsis Bundles</em> (<a href="#ct11-6">Chart&#x00A0;11-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Rapid identification of the infectious source is a critical element in managing sepsis. Specimens of blood, sputum, urine, wound drainage, and tips of invasive catheters are collected for culture using aseptic technique. IV lines are removed and reinserted at alternate sites. If possible, urinary catheters are removed or changed. Any abscesses are drained, and necrotic areas are d&#x00E9;brided. All cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotic administration. Current guidelines suggest that antibiotics should be initiated within the first hour of treatment of a patient with sepsis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib907">Surviving Sepsis Campaign, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluid Replacement Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid replacement must be instituted to correct tissue hypoperfusion that results from the incompetent vasculature and the inflammatory response. Reestablishing tissue perfusion through aggressive fluid resuscitation is key to the management of sepsis and septic shock (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>). An initial fluid challenge, which includes an IV infusion of at least 30 mL/kg of crystalloids over 30 minutes, may be required to aggressively treat sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion. In addition to monitoring BP, patient mentation, respiratory rate, fluid responsiveness after PLR, urine output, and serum lactate levels are monitored to assess effectiveness of fluid resuscitation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the infecting organism is unknown, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents are started until culture and sensitivity reports are received (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Levy &#x0026; Townsend, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>), at which time the antibiotic agents may be changed to agents that are more specific to the infecting organism and less toxic to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">If fluid therapy alone does not effectively improve tissue perfusion, vasopressor agents, specifically norepinephrine or dopamine, may be initiated to achieve a MAP of 65 mm Hg or higher. Inotropic agents may also be given to provide pharmacologic support to the myocardium. Packed red blood cells may be prescribed to support oxygen delivery and transport to the tissues. Neuromuscular blockade agents and sedation agents may be required to reduce metabolic demands and provide comfort to the patient. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, in combination with mechanical prophylaxis (e.g., sequential compression devices) should be initiated, as well as medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>-blocking agents, proton pump inhibitors).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aggressive nutritional supplementation should be initiated within 24 to 48 hours of ICU admission to address the hypermetabolic state present with septic shock (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Reintam et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib912">Wang et al., 2019</a>). Malnutrition further impairs the patient&#x2019;s resistance to infection. Enteral feedings are preferred to the parenteral route because of the increased risk of iatrogenic infection associated with IV catheters; however, enteral feedings may not be possible if decreased perfusion to the GI tract reduces peristalsis and impairs absorption.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s355"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses caring for patients in any setting must keep in mind the risks of sepsis and the high mortality rate associated with sepsis and septic shock. All invasive procedures must be carried out with aseptic technique after careful hand hygiene. In addition, IV lines, arterial and venous puncture sites, surgical incisions, traumatic wounds, and urinary catheters must be monitored for signs of infection. Nursing interventions to prevent infection need to be implemented in the care of all patients. Nurses should identify patients who are at particular risk for sepsis and septic shock (i.e., older adults and immunosuppressed patients and those with extensive trauma, burns, or diabetes), keeping in mind that these high-risk patients may not develop typical or classic signs of infection and sepsis. However, confusion with or without agitation along with an increased respiratory rate may be the first sign of infection and sepsis in any adult patient (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib865">Ferguson, Coates, Osborn, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Sepsis-3</em> recommends that patients in the ICU setting with infection be monitored for the development of sepsis by using the <em>Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment Score</em> (also known as the <em>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment</em> [SOFA] score) (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib910">Vincent, Moreno, Takala, et al., 1996</a>) (<a href="#tt11-4">Table&#x00A0;11-4</a>). The parameters that are monitored on the SOFA which include assessment of respiratory rate, platelets, bilirubin, MAP (and use of any vasopressors), serum creatinine, urine output, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (see <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>), may all be gathered and assessed by the nurse in the ICU setting. A drop of 2 points or more in a patient&#x2019;s SOFA score from baseline is suggestive of organ dysfunction. In a patient with infection, the presence of organ dysfunction suggests the development of sepsis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For a patient not in the ICU setting who has an infection, <em>Sepsis-3</em> recommends that the Quick SOFA (qSOFA) scale be used to screen for the development of sepsis. The qSOFA is an easy measurement tool that nurses may readily use; the presence of any two of the three parameters on this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page295" title="295"></span>scale suggests the development of sepsis. These parameters include a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min or higher, a GCS score of less than 15 (any change in the patient&#x2019;s mentation), and a systolic BP of 100 mm Hg or less. In order to facilitate ease of use, therefore, <em>Sepsis-3</em> recommends that any change in the patient&#x2019;s mentation status be used when computing the qSOFA scale score (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>). Another assessment tool that is frequently used in hospital-based settings that can identify patients with sepsis is the <em>Modified Early Warning System</em> (MEWS) (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib876">Institute for Healthcare Improvement [IHI], 2017</a>). The nurse assesses the patient for changes in respiratory rate, heart rate, BP, consciousness, temperature, and urine output. Scores ranging from 0 to 3 are assigned to each variable, and a MEWS score greater than 4 is suggestive of the development of sepsis (IHI, 2017) (<a href="#tt11-5">Table&#x00A0;11-5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">When caring for a patient with sepsis or septic shock, the nurse collaborates with other members of the health care team to identify the site and source of sepsis and the specific organisms involved. The nurse often obtains appropriate specimens for culture and sensitivity. Prescribed antibiotics are not given until these specimens are obtained. Hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) is common with sepsis and raises the patient&#x2019;s metabolic rate and oxygen consumption. Efforts may be made to reduce the temperature by administering acetaminophen or applying a hypothermia blanket. During these therapies, the nurse monitors the patient closely for shivering, which increases oxygen consumption. Efforts to increase comfort are important if the patient experiences fever, chills, or shivering.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse administers prescribed IV fluids and medications, including antibiotic agents and vasoactive medications, to restore vascular volume. Because of decreased perfusion, serum concentrations of antibiotic agents that are normally cleared by the kidneys and liver may increase and produce toxic effects. Therefore, the nurse monitors blood levels <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page296" title="296"></span>(serum levels of antibiotic agents, procalcitonin, CRP, BUN, creatinine, WBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet levels, coagulation studies) and reports changes to the primary provider. As with other types of shock, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic status, fluid I&#x0026;O, daily weight, and nutritional status. Close monitoring of serum albumin and prealbumin levels helps determine the patient&#x2019;s protein requirements.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s356">Neurogenic Shock</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In <strong>neurogenic shock</strong>, vasodilation occurs as a result of a loss of balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic stimulation causes vascular smooth muscle to constrict, and parasympathetic stimulation causes vascular smooth muscle to relax or dilate. The patient experiences a predominant parasympathetic stimulation that causes vasodilation lasting for an extended period, leading to a relative hypovolemic state. However, blood volume is adequate, because the vasculature is dilated; the blood volume is displaced, producing a hypotensive (low BP) state. The overriding parasympathetic stimulation that occurs with neurogenic shock causes a drastic decrease in the patient&#x2019;s systemic vascular resistance and bradycardia. Inadequate BP results in the insufficient perfusion of tissues and cells that is common to all shock states.</p>
<p class="indent">Neurogenic shock can be caused by spinal cord injury, spinal anesthesia, or other nervous system damage. It may also result from the depressant action of medications or from lack of glucose (e.g., insulin reaction) (see <a href="#ct11-5">Chart&#x00A0;11-5</a>). Neurogenic shock may have a prolonged course (spinal cord injury) or a short one (syncope or fainting). Normally, during states of stress, the sympathetic stimulation causes the BP and heart rate to increase. In neurogenic shock, the sympathetic system is not able to respond to body stressors. Therefore, the clinical characteristics of neurogenic shock are signs of parasympathetic stimulation. It is characterized by dry, warm skin rather than the cool, moist skin seen in hypovolemic shock. Another characteristic is hypotension with bradycardia, rather than the tachycardia that characterizes other forms of shock.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s357"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of neurogenic shock involves restoring sympathetic tone, either through the stabilization of a spinal cord injury or, in the instance of spinal anesthesia, by positioning the patient properly. Specific treatment depends on the cause of the shock. (Further discussion of management of patients with a spinal cord injury is presented in <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s358"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to elevate and maintain the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent neurogenic shock when a patient receives spinal or epidural anesthesia. Elevation of the head helps prevent the spread of the anesthetic agent up the spinal cord. In suspected spinal cord injury, neurogenic shock may be prevented by carefully immobilizing the patient to prevent further damage to the spinal cord (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib880">Kessler, Traini, Welk, et al., 2018</a>). Nursing interventions are directed toward supporting cardiovascular and neurologic function until the usually transient episode of neurogenic shock resolves.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with neurogenic shock have a higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) formation because of increased pooling of blood from vascular dilation; this risk is greater in patients with neurogenic shock related to spinal cord injury. The nurse must assess the patient daily for any lower extremity pain, redness, tenderness, and warmth. If the patient complains of pain and objective assessment of the calf is suspicious, the patient should be evaluated for DVT. Passive range of motion of the immobile extremities helps promote circulation. Early interventions to prevent VTE include the application of pneumatic compression devices often combined with antithrombotic agents (e.g., low-molecular-weight heparin).</p>
<p class="indent">A patient who has experienced a spinal cord injury may not report pain caused by internal injuries. Therefore, in the immediate post-injury period, the nurse must monitor the patient closely for signs of internal bleeding that could lead to hypovolemic shock.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s359">Anaphylactic Shock</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Anaphylactic shock</strong> is caused by a severe allergic reaction when patients who have already produced antibodies to an antigen (foreign substance) develop a systemic antigen&#x2013;antibody reaction; specifically, an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated response. This antigen&#x2013;antibody reaction provokes mast cells to release potent vasoactive substances, such as histamine or bradykinin, and activates inflammatory cytokines, causing widespread vasodilation and capillary permeability. The most common triggers are foods (especially peanuts), medications, and insect stings and bites (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib895">Pajno, Fernandez-Rivas, Arasi, et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ct11-5">Chart&#x00A0;11-5</a>). Anaphylaxis has three defining characteristics:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Acute onset of symptoms</span></li>
<li><span>Presence of two or more symptoms that include respiratory compromise, reduced BP, GI distress, and skin or mucosal tissue irritation</span></li>
<li><span>Cardiovascular compromise from minutes to hours after exposure to the antigen</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may present within 2 to 30 minutes of exposure to the antigen; however, occasionally some reactions may not develop for several hours (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Chan &#x0026; John, 2020</a>). The patient may report headache, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, acute abdominal pain or discomfort, pruritus, and feeling of impending doom. Assessment may reveal diffuse erythema and generalized flushing, dyspnea (laryngeal edema), bronchospasm, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension. Characteristics of severe anaphylaxis usually include rapid onset of hypotension, neurologic compromise, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Chan &#x0026; John, 2020</a>). Anaphylactoid reactions present similarly to anaphylaxis but are not mediated by IgE responses. Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions are often clinically indistinguishable (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Pajno et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s360"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of anaphylactic shock requires removing the causative antigen (e.g., discontinuing an antibiotic agent), administering medications that restore vascular tone, and providing emergency support of basic life functions. Fluid management is critical, as massive fluid shifts can occur within minutes due to increased vascular permeability (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Pajno et al., 2018</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page297" title="297"></span>Intramuscular epinephrine is given for its vasoconstrictive action. Diphenhydramine is given intravenously to reverse the effects of histamine, thereby reducing capillary permeability. Nebulized medications, such as albuterol, may be given to reverse histamine-induced bronchospasm.</p>
<p class="indent">If cardiac arrest and respiratory arrest are imminent or have occurred, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is performed. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary to establish an airway. IV lines are inserted to provide access for administering fluids and medications. See <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> for further discussion of anaphylaxis and specific chemical mediators.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s361"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse has an important role in prevention and early recognition of anaphylactic shock. The nurse must assess all patients for allergies or previous reactions to antigens (e.g., medications, blood products, foods, contrast agents, latex) and communicate the existence of these allergies or reactions to others. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of previous reactions and steps taken by the patient and the family to prevent further exposure to antigens. When new allergies are identified, the nurse advises the patient to wear or carry identification that names the specific allergen or antigen.</p>
<p class="indent">When administering any new medication, the nurse observes all patients for allergic reactions. This is especially important with antibiotics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Chan &#x0026; John, 2020</a>). Previous adverse drug reactions increase the risk that the patient will develop a reaction to a new medication. If the patient reports an allergy to a medication, the nurse must be aware of the risks involved in the administration of similar medications.</p>
<p class="indent">At any diagnostic testing site, the nurse must identify patients who are at risk for anaphylactic reactions to contrast agents (radiopaque, dyelike substances that may contain iodine) used for diagnostic tests. The nurse must be knowledgeable about the clinical signs of anaphylaxis, must take immediate action if signs and symptoms occur, and must be prepared to begin CPR if cardiorespiratory arrest occurs.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients with a known allergy to iodine or fish and those who have had previous allergic reactions to contrast agents are at high risk for anaphylactic reactions. The nurse should ask the patient about the allergy, signs and symptoms and severity, and if the patient has been tested for the allergy or carries an autoinjectable epinephrine device. This information must be communicated to the staff at the diagnostic testing site, including x-ray personnel.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Community health and home health nurses who administer medications, including antibiotic agents, in the patient&#x2019;s home or other settings, must be prepared to administer epinephrine intramuscularly in the event of an anaphylactic reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">After recovery from anaphylaxis, the patient and the family require an explanation of the event. Furthermore, the nurse provides education about avoiding future exposure to antigens and administering emergency medications to treat anaphylaxis (see <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>).</p>
