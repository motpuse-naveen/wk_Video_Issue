<h4 class="h4" id="s109">Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues Surrounding Genetics</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The rapid application of genetics and genomics across all sectors of health care has had implications for gathering, recording, and sharing personal health information. An ethical foundation provides nurses with a holistic framework for handling these issues with integrity and provides a basis for communicating genetic and genomic information to a patient, a family, other care providers, community agencies and organizations, and for society. Nurses must consider their responsibilities in handling genetic and genomic information and strive to ensure that informed decision making occurs, that patient and family health information is kept private and confidential, and that access to and justice in health care is available to everyone (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s110">Ethical Concerns</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ethical principles of beneficence (i.e., to do good) and nonmaleficence (i.e., to do no harm), as well as autonomy, justice, fidelity, and veracity, are used to resolve ethical dilemmas that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page132" title="132"></span>may arise in clinical care. Respect for persons is the ethical principle underlying all nursing care. Using these principles and the values of caring, nurses can promote thoughtful discussions that are useful when patients and families are facing genetics- and genomics-related health and reproductive decisions and consequences (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>). The ethical principles of autonomy, fidelity, and veracity are also important (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib350">ANA, 2015</a>). (Further information about ethics is included in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Ethical questions relating to genetics and genomics occur in all settings and at all levels of nursing practice. At the level of direct patient care, nurses participate in providing genetic information, testing, and gene-based therapeutics. They offer patient care based on the values of self-determination and personal autonomy. To be as fully informed as possible, patients need appropriate, accurate, and complete information given at a level and in a form so that they and their families can make well-informed personal, medical, and reproductive health decisions. Nurses can help patients clarify values and goals, assess understanding of information, protect their rights, and support their decisions. Nurses can advocate for patient autonomy in health decisions. Several resources and position statements have been developed to guide genetic-related nursing practice (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib374">International Society of Nurses in Genetics [ISONG], 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Respecting the patient&#x2019;s right to self-determination&#x2014;that is, supporting decisions that reflect the patient&#x2019;s personal beliefs, values, and interests&#x2014;is a central principle in directing how nurses provide genetic and genomic information and counseling. Nurses and others participating in genetic counseling make every attempt to respect the patient&#x2019;s ability to make autonomous decisions. Recognizing one&#x2019;s own attitudes and beliefs and how communication of genetic and genomic information may be influenced by those attitudes and beliefs is a first step toward assuring patients&#x2019; autonomous decision making.</p>
<p class="indent">Confidentiality of genetic and genomic information and respect for privacy are other essential principles underlying genetic counseling. Patients have the right to not have test results divulged to anyone, including insurers, primary providers, employers, or family members. Some patients pay for testing themselves so that insurers will not learn of the test, and others use a different name for testing to protect their privacy.</p>
<p class="indent">Ethical challenges may occur for family members and health care providers when the findings of one person&#x2019;s test may inadvertently disclose another family member&#x2019;s risk or carrier status. A nurse may want to disclose genetic information to family members who could experience significant harm if they do not know such information. However, the patient may have other views and may wish to keep this information from the family, resulting in an ethical dilemma for both patient and nurse. The nurse must honor the patient&#x2019;s wishes, while explaining to the patient the potential benefit this information may have for other family members (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib374">ISONG, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ethical considerations must be reviewed as part of genetic and genomic research. For example, before a person participates in genetic and genomic clinical research, the research team must discuss how incidental findings will be addressed. Incidental findings are genetic-related illnesses which are found secondary to the intended goals of the research project or purpose of the test (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Boardman &#x0026; Hale, 2018</a>). The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Policy Statement [ACMG], 2017</a>) issued a policy statement that lists conditions known to be treatable and should be reported to the patient if found incidentally during clinical research.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s111">Legal Aspects of Personalized Health Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), a law passed in 2008, protects individuals from genetic discrimination (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Rothstein, 2018</a>). Its purpose is to protect Americans against improper use of genetic and genomic information in insurance and employment decisions. GINA is particularly helpful for people who carry a gene mutation but are asymptomatic for the illness. The act prohibits health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy person or charging higher insurance rates based on a person&#x2019;s genetic predisposition to a disease. GINA offers legal protection with regard to health insurance and employment; however, gaps in protection exist with regard to disability, life, and long-term care insurance. The act also prevents employers from using a person&#x2019;s genetic and genomic information to make decisions about hiring, job placement, promotion, or firing. Protection provided by GINA does not apply to employers with less than 15 employees, to people in the military, Veterans Health Administration, Indian Health Services, and Federal Employees Health Benefits Programs (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Rothstein, 2018</a>). As a result of GINA, most Americans are free to use genetic and genomic information in health care without the fear of misuse; however, public awareness of this law is limited (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib368">Cragun, Weidner, Kechik, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">While not specifically intended for genetic health-related concerns, other health care laws offer some additional protection to individuals with regard to genetics. For example, the Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, offers some protection for a person with a genetic illness by prohibiting health insurers from discrimination based on a preexisting condition (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Rich, 2018</a>). The Americans With Disabilities Act offers legal protection related to employment concerns and physical or intellectual impairment as a result of a genetic disorder. Finally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in 1996, places restrictions on sharing identifiable health information and places stringent requirements on maintaining the privacy of health-related content and prohibits the use of genetic information to establish insurance eligibility (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2017). However, HIPAA does not prohibit group plans from increasing premiums, excluding coverage for a specific condition, or imposing a lifetime cap on benefits.</p>
<p class="indent">The National Human Genome Research Institute, Policy and Program Analysis branch, has a summary of each state&#x2019;s legislation related to genomic statutes and bills (NIH, NHGRI, 2019b). See also the Resources section at the end of this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s112">Ancestry, Cultural, Social, and Spiritual Concerns Related to Genetic and Genomic Practice</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic assessment addresses the ancestry of patients and families, as well as their ethnicity. This information helps identify individual patients and groups who could benefit from genetic testing for carrier identification, prenatal diagnosis, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page133" title="133"></span>and susceptibility testing. For example, carrier testing for sickle cell disease is routinely offered to people of African American descent, and carrier testing for Tay-Sachs disease and Canavan disease is offered to people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ([ACOG], 2019) recognizes the benefit of a thorough family history in correlation with the identification of personalized risks and the option of genetic testing prior to conception. Health care providers must be aware of at-risk status based on racial and ethnic population. Ideally, carrier testing is offered before conception to allow people who are carriers to make decisions about reproduction. Prenatal diagnosis is offered and discussed when both partners of a couple are found to be carriers.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to inquire about the patient&#x2019;s ethnic backgrounds when assessing for susceptibilities to adult-onset conditions such as hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. For example, a <em>BRCA1</em> cancer&#x2013;predisposing gene mutation seems to occur more frequently in women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Therefore, asking about ethnicity can help identify people with an increased risk of cancer gene mutations.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should consider patients&#x2019; views about the significance of a genetic condition and its effect on self-concept, as well as patients&#x2019; perception of the role of genetics in health and illness, reproduction, and disability. For instance, among women without a history of breast cancer but with a strong family history of breast cancer, negative results for the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations may not be a relief, since those women&#x2019;s risks for having breast cancer is estimated to be four times as high as women who do not have a family history. Among these women, negative findings for known genetic mutations may simply seem uninformative and cause frustration (Schroeder, Duggleby, &#x0026; Cameron, 2017; see <a href="#ct6-3">Chart&#x00A0;6-3</a>: Nursing Research Profile: Living with Breast Cancer Risk). Patients&#x2019; social and cultural backgrounds determine their interpretations and values about information obtained from genetic testing and evaluation and thus influence their perceptions of health, illness, and risk. Family structure, decision making, and educational background contribute in the same way (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of the patients&#x2019; beliefs, values, and expectations regarding genetic testing and genetic and genomic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page134" title="134"></span>information helps nurses provide appropriate information about the specific genetics or genomics topic. For example, in some cultures, people believe that health means the absence of symptoms and that the cause of illness is supernatural. Patients with these beliefs may initially reject suggestions for presymptomatic or carrier testing. However, by including resources such as family and cultural and religious community leaders when providing genetics- or genomics-related health care, nurses can help ensure that patients receive information in a way that transcends social, cultural, and economic barriers (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib419">Tluczek, Twal, Beamer, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Living with Breast Cancer Risk</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Schroeder, D., Duggleby, W., &#x0026; Cameron, B. L. (2017). Moving in and out of the what-ifs: The experiences of unaffected women living in families where a breast cancer 1 or 2 genetic mutation was not found. <em>Cancer Nursing, 40</em>(5), 386&#x2013;393.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The genetic mutations of <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> account for approximately 15% of cases of familial breast cancer in women. For women without these mutations and without breast cancer but with a strong family history, the risk of eventually having breast cancer remains high. These risks may be related to another currently unidentified <em>BRCA</em> mutation or to a mutation in another gene not yet identified. Little is known about the effects that living with a high breast cancer risk has on these women. Therefore, the aims of this study were to discover the day-to-day lived experience of having breast cancer risk on women with a strong family history of breast cancer but who are <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> negative, and to elucidate how they cope with the knowledge of their breast cancer risk.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a hermeneutic phenomenologic study that used van Manen&#x2019;s methods to explore the lived experiences among <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> negative women without breast cancer but with a strong family history of breast cancer and to uncover the meanings this knowledge had on their everyday lives. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants eligible to be included in the study. The researchers hoped to recruit between five and eight participants. Ten patients who received care in a hereditary breast and ovarian cancer clinic (HBOC) in Western Canada consented to participate in this study, although one dropped out prior to data collection, resulting in a total of nine participants.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants (<em>N</em> = 9) engaged in a total of 20 interviews with the researchers. Each participant engaged in at least two conversations. After each session, participants were given copies of the summaries of the conversations and proposed emerging themes that researchers posited for corroboration, in order to ensure trustworthiness of findings. Researchers identified one main overarching theme of <em>Moving In and Out of the What-Ifs,</em> which identified the tensions between &#x201C;normal&#x201D; living, as expressed in the subtheme <em>Just Moving Along: Living a Normal Life,</em> that was juxtaposed with the &#x201C;what-ifs&#x201D; subthemes, which included <em>Moving Into Those Dark Spaces, Is There Something Wrong with Me?</em> and <em>Markings in Time.</em> For instance, all participants identified that most of the time they had an awareness of their familial breast cancer risk, but kept it in the background, expressing the need to &#x201C;live a normal life.&#x201D; The &#x201C;dark spaces&#x201D; were described as triggers that provoked anxiety about their risks, such as anticipating an appointment at the HBOC, or hearing news of a close relative newly diagnosed with cancer. Although all participants identified themselves as &#x201C;healthy,&#x201D; they found that many times, others who knew of their risks tended to label them as not healthy, causing conflict within them &#x201C;Is there something wrong with me?&#x201D; Lastly, there were key milestones in participants&#x2019; lives that caused tension, or &#x201C;time marks,&#x201D; such as approaching or surpassing an age when a family member was diagnosed with cancer, or when a family member died of cancer. Coping through the &#x201C;dark spaces&#x201D; the &#x201C;wrongness&#x201D; and the &#x201C;marks in time&#x201D; was facilitated through the methods employed in the subthemes <em>Living in the Moment,</em> or slowing down to enjoy the &#x201C;here and now&#x201D;; <em>Being Cared For,</em> or feeling cared for by significant others as well as the staff at the HBOC; and, <em>Keeping Me Grounded,</em> expressed by having family and significant others find ways to keep them out of the &#x201C;dark spaces,&#x201D; supporting their view of themselves as healthy, and celebrating significant &#x201C;time marks&#x201D; with them.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that being <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> negative can be seen as both a blessing and a curse for women who are nonetheless at risk for familial breast cancer. These women must deal with conflicting emotions and anxieties that surround the uncertainty of living with this risk. Nurses who care for women at risk for familial breast cancer who are <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> negative should aim to foster their coping mechanisms by encouraging them to focus on the positives in the &#x201C;here and now&#x201D; of their lives, by keeping them grounded, and by demonstrating a caring relationship with them.</p>
