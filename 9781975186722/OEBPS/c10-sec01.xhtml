<h4 class="h4" id="s186">Fundamental Concepts</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Basic concepts of chemistry are involved in fluid and electrolyte balance and imbalance. A solution is a mixture of solvent, which is a fluid medium, and solutes, which are particles. Blood is composed of blood cells that are suspended in plasma. The blood cells include erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Plasma is composed of 92% water, which is a solvent that contains solutes including proteins (mainly albumin), glucose, lipoproteins, and mineral ions, termed electrolytes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s187">Amount and Composition of Body Fluids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 60% of a typical adult&#x2019;s weight consists of fluid (water and electrolytes) (<a href="#ff10-1">Fig.&#x00A0;10-1</a>). Factors that influence the amount of body fluid are age, gender, and body fat. In general, younger people have a higher percentage of body fluid than older adults, and men have proportionately more body fluid than women. The skeleton has low water content. Muscle, skin, and blood contain the highest amounts of water (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Body fluid is located in two fluid compartments: the intracellular space (fluid in the cells) and the extracellular space (fluid outside the cells). Approximately two thirds of body fluid is in the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment. Approximately one third is in the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The ECF compartment is further divided into the intravascular (blood), interstitial, and transcellular fluid spaces:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The intravascular space (the fluid within the blood vessels) contains plasma, the effective circulating volume. Approximately 3 L of the average 6 L of blood volume in adults is made up of plasma. The remaining 3 L is made up of the blood cells: erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes (platelets).</span></li>
<li><span>The interstitial space contains the fluid that surrounds the cell and totals about 11 to 12 L in an adult. Lymph is an interstitial fluid.</span></li>
<li><span>The transcellular space is the smallest division of the ECF compartment and contains approximately 1 L. Examples of transcellular fluids include cerebrospinal, pericardial, synovial, intraocular, and pleural fluids, sweat, and digestive secretions.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">As the next section describes, the ECF transports electrolytes; it also carries other substances, such as enzymes and hormones.</p>
<p class="indent">Body fluid normally moves between the two major compartments (i.e., ICF and ECF) in an effort to maintain equilibrium between the spaces. A semipermeable membrane surrounding each of the cells allows certain fluids and electrolytes to move between the ICF and ECF. Loss of fluid from the ICF or ECF can disrupt equilibrium. The body constantly works to keep fluid and electrolytes in a homeostatic balance. If too much fluid moves from ICF to ECF, cellular dehydration can occur. If too much fluid moves from ECF to ICF, cell swelling can occur (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Papadakis, McPhee, &#x0026; Rabow, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes fluid is not lost from the body but is unavailable for use by either the ICF or ECF. Loss of ECF into a space that does not contribute to equilibrium between the ICF and the ECF is referred to as a third-space fluid shift, or third spacing. Third-space fluid accumulates within membrane-bound spaces in the body such as the peritoneal cavity and pleural space. Examples of third-spaced fluid include ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and angioedema (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib741">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Early evidence of a third-space fluid shift is a decrease in urine output despite adequate fluid intake. Urine output decreases because fluid shifts out of the intravascular space; the kidneys then receive less blood and attempt to compensate by decreasing urine output. Other signs and symptoms of third spacing that indicate an intravascular fluid volume deficit (FVD) include increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, decreased central venous pressure, edema, increased body weight, and imbalances in fluid intake and output (I&#x0026;O). Third-space fluid is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream over a period of a few days to a few weeks. However, the acute volume depletion must be restored to prevent further complications (Sterns, 2017a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Electrolytes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Electrolytes in body fluids are active chemicals (cations that carry positive charges and anions that carry negative charges). The major cations in body fluid are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen ions. The major anions are chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, sulfate, and negatively charged protein ions.</p>
<p class="indent">These chemicals unite in varying combinations. Therefore, electrolyte concentration in the body is expressed in terms of milliequivalents (mEq) per liter, a measure of chemical activity, rather than in terms of milligrams (mg), and a unit of weight. More specifically, a milliequivalent is defined as being equivalent to the electrochemical activity of 1 mg of hydrogen. In a solution, cations and anions are equal in milliequivalents per liter.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrolyte concentrations in the ICF differ from those in the ECF, as reflected in <a href="#tt10-1">Table&#x00A0;10-1</a>. Because special techniques are required to measure electrolyte concentrations in the ICF, it is customary to measure the electrolytes in the most accessible portion of the ECF&#x2014;namely, the plasma (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium ions, which are positively charged, far outnumber the other cations in the ECF. Because sodium concentration affects the overall concentration of the ECF, sodium is important in regulating the volume of body fluid. Water follows movement of sodium in the body fluids. Retention of sodium is associated with fluid retention, and excessive loss of sodium is usually associated with decreased volume of body fluid.</p>
<p class="indent">As shown in <a href="#tt10-1">Table&#x00A0;10-1</a>, one of the major electrolytes in the ICF is potassium. The ECF has a low concentration of potassium, and patients can tolerate only small changes in potassium concentration. Changes in potassium within the ECF can cause cardiac rhythm disturbances and hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrest. Therefore, the release of large stores of intracellular potassium, typically caused by trauma to the cells and tissues, can be extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="indent">The body expends a great deal of energy maintaining the high extracellular concentration of sodium and the high intracellular concentration of potassium. It does so by means of a cell membrane pump that exchanges sodium and potassium ions, termed the sodium&#x2013;potassium pump (see discussion later in this chapter).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Osmosis, Osmolality, and Osmolarity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When two different solutions are separated by a membrane that is semi-permeable; fluid shifts from the region of less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution, until the solutions are of equal concentration. This diffusion of water caused by fluid and solute concentration gradients is known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osmosis:&lt;/b&gt; the process by which fluid moves across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration; the process continues until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane">osmosis</button></strong> (<a href="#ff10-2">Fig.&#x00A0;10-2</a>). Osmolality and osmolarity are terms that describe the concentration of solutes or dissolved particles in a solution. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osmolality:&lt;/b&gt; the number of milliosmoles (the standard unit of osmotic pressure) per kilogram of solvent; expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg).

The term <em>osmolality</em> is used more often than <em>osmolarity</em> to evaluate the solutes in the blood or urine (Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018a).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Normal movement of fluids through the capillary wall into the tissues depends on Starling&#x2019;s Laws of Capillary Forces. Capillary forces are the two forces at every capillary membrane: hydrostatic pressure (also called hydraulic pressure) and osmotic pressure. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hydrostatic pressure:&lt;/b&gt; the pressure created by the weight of fluid against the wall that contains it. In the body, hydrostatic pressure in blood vessels results from the weight of fluid itself and the force resulting from cardiac contraction (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; hydraulic pressure)">Hydrostatic pressure</button></strong> is the pressure exerted by fluid on the walls of the blood vessel, and osmotic pressure is the pressure exerted by the solutes within the plasma. Hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of the capillary toward the ICF. Osmotic pressure pulls fluid into the capillary from the ICF. These forces oppose each other at every capillary membrane and balance each other out in healthy (homeostatic) conditions. The direction of fluid movement depends on the differences in the two opposing forces of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure (Fig.&#x00A0;10-3). If hydrostatic pressure is greater than osmotic pressure, then the movement of fluid is from ECF toward the ICF.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Oncotic Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Osmotic pressure specifically exerted by the albumin within the bloodstream is termed <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;colloid oncotic pressure:&lt;/b&gt; osmotic pressure created by the protein (mainly albumin) in the bloodstream (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; colloidal osmotic pressure)">colloid oncotic pressure</button></strong> or <strong>colloid osmotic pressure</strong><strong>.</strong> A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;colloid:&lt;/b&gt; a fluid containing particles that are nonsoluble and evenly distributed throughout the solution">colloid</button></strong> is fluid consisting of nonsoluble substances that are evenly distributed within a solvent. Blood is an example of a colloid solution. It is a mixture of blood cells and plasma which contains water, proteins, enzymes, and other solutes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Crystalloid versus Colloid Solutions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid replacement in the body depends on what type of fluid is lost. If a large amount of blood is lost, for example, the preferred treatment is replacement with matching blood (commonly packed red blood cells). However, crystalloid or colloid solutions can be used to temporarily replace blood or replenish fluid losses from the body. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;crystalloid:&lt;/b&gt; a fluid containing soluble mineral ions and water in solution">Crystalloid</button></strong> solutions are mineral ions dissolved in water. Examples include normal saline (0.9% NaCl), half normal saline (0.45% NaCl), and lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution (Plasma-Lyte). Crystalloid solutions are commonly used to replace fluid in hypovolemia. Examples of colloid solutions include albumin solutions, hyperoncotic starch, and dextran. Colloid solutions are commonly used as temporary blood replacement until the correct type of blood is available for infusion (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Mandel &#x0026; Palevsky, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Tonicity</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tonicity:&lt;/b&gt; fluid tension or the effect that osmotic pressure of a solution with impermeable solutes exerts on cell size because of water movement across the cell membrane">Tonicity</button></strong> is the ability of solutes to cause an osmotic driving force that promotes water movement from one compartment to another. Movement of water is either from ICF to ECF or ECF to ICF. The tonicity of a solution can be used to drive water movement between compartments to change the state of cellular hydration and cell size. Tonicity most commonly refers to the NaCl content of the solution. The tonicity of a solution is determined by how it compares to physiologic fluid which is 0.9% NaCl (Sterns, 2017b). Fluids can be isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic compared to physiologic fluid of 0.9% NaCl.</p>
<p class="indent">Tonicity commonly pertains to intravenous (IV) solutions. IV solutions of different tonicities can be infused into the bloodstream to produce movement of water from one compartment to the other.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Isotonic solutions</strong> are composed of 0.9% NaCl; the same sodium and chloride concentration as the bloodstream and the same water concentration as the bloodstream. Isotonic solutions do not provoke water movement between ICF or ECF compartments. Isotonic solutions expand the plasma volume of the blood (Sterns, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Hypotonic solutions</strong> are composed of less sodium chloride concentration compared to the blood; for example, 0.45% NaCl or 0.225% NaCl. Hypotonic solutions contain less solute but more water than the bloodstream. IV hypotonic solution infusions can be used to move water from the ECF into the ICF. IV hypotonic solutions can be used to hydrate a patient as they contain high water concentration (Sterns, 2017b).</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>Hypertonic solutions</strong> are composed of greater concentration of NaCl compared to blood (e.g., 3% NaCl). Hypertonic solutions contain more solute concentration and less water than the bloodstream. IV hypertonic solution can be infused into the bloodstream to pull water from the ICF into the ECF. The movement of water from ICF to ECF will cause dehydration of the cells. This is useful in disorders of severe edema; particularly cerebral edema, which requires immediate treatment. Sodium, glucose, and mannitol are examples of solutes capable of affecting water movement from ICF to ECF. Mannitol, a nonresorbable sugar alcohol, in water is an IV solution that can be used to move water from ICF to ECF rapidly. IV mannitol can induce a condition termed osmotic diuresis; it is most commonly used to decrease cerebral edema (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Brater &#x0026; Ellison, 2019</a>). (See discussion of parenteral therapy later in this chapter.)</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Osmotic diuresis</strong> is the increase in urine output caused by the excretion of solutes, such as glucose or mannitol. In high concentrations, glucose or mannitol can act as solutes within the bloodstream. These solutes exert a force that pulls water out of the ICF and brings it into the ECF (bloodstream). The water then is filtered out of the bloodstream at the kidneys and excreted into the urine. The urine contains extra water that is derived from the ICF; this increased urine volume is called diuresis (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Brater &#x0026; Ellison, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Diffusion</h6>

It occurs through the random movement of ions and molecules. Examples of diffusion are the exchange of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) between the pulmonary capillaries and alveoli and the tendency of sodium to move from the ECF compartment, where the sodium concentration is high, to the ICF, where its concentration is low (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries tends to filter fluid out of the intravascular compartment into the interstitial fluid. Movement of water and solutes occurs from an area of high hydrostatic pressure to an area of low hydrostatic pressure. The kidneys filter approximately 180 L of plasma per day. Another example of filtration is the passage of water and electrolytes from the capillary bed to the interstitial fluid; in this instance, the hydrostatic pressure results from the pumping action of the heart (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">The sodium concentration is greater in the ECF than in the ICF; because of this, sodium tends to enter the cell by diffusion. To maintain cellular function, more potassium needs to be inside the cell and more sodium needs to be outside the cell. The sodium&#x2013;potassium pump maintains the electrolyte gradient of high extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> compared to low intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, and high intracellular K<sup>+</sup> compared to low extracellular K<sup>+</sup>. The pump maintains the different concentrations of cations Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in and out of the cell. For every 3 Na<sup>+</sup> pumped out of the cell, 2 K<sup>+</sup> ions are pumped into the cell (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Pirahanchi &#x0026; Aeddula, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The sodium&#x2013;potassium pump uses energy to maintain this electrolyte gradient and is powered by the enzyme termed Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.

<h6 class="h6">Kidneys</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The daily urine volume excreted by the adult varies according to hydration status. A well-hydrated person excretes 1 to 2 L urine per day. A general rule is that the output is approximately 1 mL of urine per kilogram of body weight per hour (1 mL/kg/h) in all age groups (Sterns, 2017a). For example, a 70-kg adult will excrete 70 mL/h; over 24 hours this equals approximately 1680 mL of urine.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Skin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Perspiration is visible water and electrolyte loss through the skin (sweating). The chief solutes in sweat are sodium, chloride, and potassium. Actual sweat losses can vary from 0 to 1000 mL or more every hour, depending on factors such as the environmental and body temperature. Continuous water loss by evaporation through the skin (approximately 500 mL/day) occurs through perspiration, referred to as insensible water loss (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). Fever, high environmental temperature, and exercise greatly increase insensible water loss through the skin. Burn injury, which causes the loss of the natural skin barrier, also causes a large water loss (Sterns, 2017b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lungs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The lungs normally eliminate water vapor, also referred to as insensible water loss, at a rate of approximately 300 mL daily (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). The loss is much greater with increased respiratory rate or depth, or in a dry climate. Similar to water loss through the skin, fever, high environmental temperature, and exercise all increase insensible water loss through the lungs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal Tract</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Loss of fluid from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is about 100 to 200 mL daily. Approximately 8 L of fluid circulates through the GI system every 24 hours. However, most of the fluid is reabsorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine. Diarrhea and fistulas of the intestine can cause large losses of fluids (Sterns, 2018a).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s190">Laboratory Tests for Evaluating Fluid Status</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Serum osmolality primarily reflects the concentration of sodium, although blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose also play a major role in determining serum osmolality. Urine osmolality is determined by urea, creatinine, and uric acid. When measured with serum osmolality, urine osmolality is the most reliable indicator of urine concentration. In healthy adults, normal serum osmolality is 275 to 290 mOsm/kg (Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018a). The value of osmolarity is usually within 10 mOsm of the value of osmolality (Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018a). Factors that increase and decrease serum and urine osmolality are identified in <a href="#tt10-3">Table&#x00A0;10-3</a>. Serum osmolality may be measured directly through laboratory tests or estimated at the bedside by doubling the serum sodium level or by using the following formula:</p>
<p class="center2"><img src="images/229-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Urine specific gravity measures the density of urine compared to water. It is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine. It is one way to assess the kidneys&#x2019; ability to excrete or conserve water. The specific gravity of urine is compared to that of distilled water, which has a specific gravity of 1.000. The normal range of urine specific gravity is 1.005 to 1.030 (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib745">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2017</a>). Urine with a specific gravity of 1.005 is very dilute or high in water <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page230" title="230"></span>content, whereas urine with a specific gravity of 1.030 is very concentrated or low in water content. Under normal conditions, a well-hydrated person excretes urine with a low specific gravity, whereas a dehydrated person excretes urine with high specific gravity. Urine specific gravity can be measured by sending approximately 20 mL of urine to the laboratory for urinalysis testing or assessed using a urine dipstick test. Specific gravity is a less reliable indicator of urine concentration than urine osmolality; increased glucose or protein in urine can cause a falsely elevated specific gravity. Factors that increase or decrease urine osmolality are the same as those for urine specific gravity (Sterns, 2017a).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">BUN is a laboratory value that measures the amount of urea in the bloodstream. The normal range of BUN is 10 to 20 mg/dL (3.6 to 7.2 mmol/L). BUN level can vary with renal function, amount of cellular breakdown, protein intake, and hydration status. If urine output decreases, as occurs in renal dysfunction, then urea is not excreted and accumulates in the bloodstream causing an increase. Increased BUN can also occur if water content in the bloodstream decreases due to dehydration. If a person is consuming a high protein diet, there is an increased amino acid content in the bloodstream, which in turn increases nitrogen content of the blood, thereby increasing BUN (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Inker &#x0026; Perrone, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Additional factors that increase BUN include GI bleeding, fever, and sepsis. Factors that decrease BUN include end-stage liver disease, a low protein diet, starvation (due to low protein), and any condition that results in expanded fluid volume which dilutes urea in the blood (e.g., pregnancy). Because of all these variables, BUN is not an optimal gauge of kidney function (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Inker &#x0026; Perrone, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Creatinine is a breakdown product of muscle metabolism that is almost totally cleared from the bloodstream and excreted by the kidney. It is a better indicator of renal function than BUN because it does not vary with protein intake or hydration status. The normal serum creatinine is approximately 0.7 to 1.4 mg/dL (62 to 124 mmol/L); however, its concentration depends on lean body mass and varies from person to person. Serum creatinine levels increase when renal function decreases in most people and is an accurate gauge of kidney function (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hematocrit measures the percentage of red blood cells (RBCs) (erythrocytes) in a volume of whole blood and normally ranges from 42% to 52% in men and 35% to 47% in women. Conditions that increase the hematocrit value are dehydration and polycythemia. Dehydration causes decreased water content of the blood which concentrates the RBCs in the bloodstream. Polycythemia is a disorder in which there is an abnormally high number of RBCs made by the bone marrow, which in turn increases the number of RBCs in the bloodstream. Conversely, over hydration (which increases the volume of water within the bloodstream) will decrease the hematocrit. Anemia (which is a lack of sufficient production of RBCs by the bone marrow) causes decreased hematocrit (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Schrier, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Urine sodium values change with sodium intake and the status of fluid volume: As sodium intake increases, excretion increases; as the circulating fluid volume decreases, sodium is conserved. Normal urine sodium levels range from 75 to 200 mEq/24 h (75 to 200 mmol/24 h). A random specimen usually contains more than 40 mEq/L of sodium. Urine sodium levels are used to assess volume status and are useful in the diagnosis of hyponatremia and acute kidney injury (Sterns, 2017a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s191">Homeostatic Mechanisms</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The body is equipped with remarkable homeostatic mechanisms to keep the composition and volume of body fluid within narrow limits of normal. Organs involved in homeostasis include the kidneys, heart, lungs, pituitary gland, adrenal glands, and parathyroid glands (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Kidney Functions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Vital to the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, the kidneys normally filter 180 L of plasma every day in the adult and excrete 1 to 2 L of urine (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Inker &#x0026; Perrone, 2018</a>). They act both autonomously and in response to hormones, such as aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). Major functions of the kidneys in maintaining normal fluid balance include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Regulation of ECF volume and osmolality by selective retention and excretion of body fluids</span></li>
<li><span>Regulation of normal electrolyte levels in the ECF by selective electrolyte retention and excretion of hydrogen ions</span></li>
<li><span>Regulation of pH of the ECF by retention and excretion of hydrogen ions</span></li>
<li><span>Excretion of metabolic wastes and toxic substances (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Inker &#x0026; Perrone, 2018</a>)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Given these functions, failure of the kidneys results in multiple fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Heart and Blood Vessel Functions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The pumping action of the heart circulates blood through the kidneys under sufficient pressure to allow for urine formation. Failure of this pumping action interferes with renal perfusion and thus with water and electrolyte regulation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lung Functions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The lungs are also vital in maintaining homeostasis. Through exhalation, the lungs remove approximately 300 mL of water daily in the normal adult as insensible water loss (Sterns, 2017a). Abnormal conditions, such as hyperventilation (abnormally deep respiration) or continuous coughing, increase this water loss. The lungs also play a major role in acid&#x2013;base balance. Because the lungs regulate carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which directly influences acid content of the bloodstream, they influence acid&#x2013;base balance. When the lungs have a decrease in breathing rate, CO<sub>2</sub> is retained in the alveoli and bloodstream, which increases acid content of the blood. When the lungs have an increase in breathing rate, CO<sub>2</sub> is blown off, lost from the bloodstream, which decreases acid content of the blood (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pituitary Functions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The hypothalamus manufactures ADH, which is stored in the posterior pituitary gland and released as needed to conserve water. ADH is secreted by the pituitary gland in reaction to dehydration or blood loss and acts at the nephrons. At the collecting duct of the nephron, ADH causes increased reabsorption of water from the tubules into the bloodstream (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). This increases the water content of the bloodstream (<a href="#ff10-5">Fig.&#x00A0;10-5</a>).</p>

ADH, antidiuretic hormone; BP, blood pressure; ECF, extracellular fluid; GFR, glomerular filtration rate.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Adrenal Functions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid secreted by the zona glomerulosa (outer zone) of the adrenal cortex, has a profound effect on fluid balance. Increased secretion of aldosterone causes sodium retention (and thus water retention) and potassium loss. Conversely, decreased secretion of aldosterone causes sodium and water loss and potassium retention.</p>
<p class="indent">Cortisol, another adrenocortical hormone, has less mineralocorticoid action. However, when secreted in large quantities (or administered as corticosteroid therapy), it can also produce sodium and fluid retention (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Parathyroid Functions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The parathyroid glands, embedded in the thyroid gland, regulate calcium and phosphate balance by means of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH influences reabsorption of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream, calcium absorption <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page232" title="232"></span>from the intestine, and calcium reabsorption into the bloodstream from the renal tubules (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Baroreceptors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The baroreceptors are located in the left atrium and the carotid and aortic arches. These receptors respond to changes in the circulating blood volume and regulate sympathetic and parasympathetic neural activity as well as endocrine activities.</p>
<p class="indent">As arterial pressure decreases, baroreceptors transmit fewer impulses from the carotid and the aortic arches to the vasomotor center. A decrease in impulses stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which stimulates the sinoatrial (SA) node in the heart. The outcome is an increase in heart rate, conduction, and contractility and an increase in blood pressure. Sympathetic stimulation constricts renal arterioles, which in turn triggers renin release and stimulation of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system (see next section for further discussion) (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Renin&#x2013;Angiotensin&#x2013;Aldosterone System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the kidneys sense low perfusion or diminished blood pressure, they secrete renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which triggers the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system. This system is one of the body&#x2019;s most important compensatory mechanisms in maintaining fluid balance. Renin circulates to the liver and converts angiotensinogen, a protein synthesized by the liver, into angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates potent peripheral arterial vasoconstriction which increases arterial blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone increases sodium and water reabsorption at the nephron into the bloodstream. This raises blood volume and blood pressure. Aldosterone also stimulates secretion of potassium into the nephron tubules, which in turn causes potassium excretion by the kidney (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antidiuretic Hormone and Thirst</h6>
<p class="nonindent">ADH and the thirst mechanism have important roles in maintaining sodium concentration and oral intake of fluids. Oral intake is controlled by the thirst center located in the hypothalamus. As serum concentration or osmolality increases or blood volume decreases, neurons in the hypothalamus are stimulated by intracellular dehydration; thirst then occurs, and the person increases their intake of oral fluids. When increased osmolality is sensed by the brain, the posterior pituitary is stimulated to release ADH. ADH acts at the kidney nephrons to increase water reabsorption into the bloodstream. ADH raises blood volume and decreases urine output (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Osmoreceptors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Located on the surface of the hypothalamus, osmoreceptors sense changes in sodium concentration. As osmotic pressure increases, the neurons become dehydrated and quickly release impulses to the posterior pituitary, which increases the release of ADH, which then travels in the blood to the kidneys, where it alters permeability to water, causing increased reabsorption of water and decreased urine output. The retained water dilutes the ECF and returns its concentration to normal. Restoration of normal osmotic pressure provides feedback to the osmoreceptors to inhibit further ADH release (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>) (see <a href="#ff10-5">Fig.&#x00A0;10-5</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Natriuretic Peptides</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Natriuretic peptide hormones affect fluid volume and cardiovascular function through natriuresis (the excretion of sodium), direct vasodilation, and the opposition of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system. The most common natriuretic peptides include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and <em>N</em>-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Chen &#x0026; Colucci, 2017</a>). ANP is synthesized, stored, and released by muscle cells of the atria of the heart. BNP and NT-pro BNP are released mainly by ventricular muscle cells of the heart. BNP and NT-pro BNP levels are often measured in the clinical diagnosis and management of heart failure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). NT-pro BNP has a longer half-life than BNP, so its level remains elevated in the bloodstream for a longer period of time than BNP. Natriuretic peptides are also secreted in other disorders including renal failure, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, and sepsis. Natriuretic peptides decrease water and sodium in the circulatory system which in turn decreases blood pressure. Their action is directly opposite that of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system (<a href="#ff10-6">Fig.&#x00A0;10-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are two other natriuretic peptides that are not usually measured clinically. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is distributed within the brain, ovary, uterus, testis, and epididymis. D-type natriuretic peptide (DNP) has structural similarities to ANP, BNP, and CNP.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s192"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Normal physiologic changes of aging include reduced cardiac, renal, and respiratory function. Body fat changes, body water content decreases, and muscle mass decreases. These changes of aging may alter the older adult&#x2019;s responses to fluid and electrolyte changes and acid&#x2013;base disturbances. Decreased respiratory function and renal function can cause impaired acid&#x2013;base balance in older adults with major illness or trauma. Decreased renal function that occurs with age can also cause slightly elevated serum creatinine. Decreased muscle mass that occurs with aging leads to decreased daily breakdown of muscle, which reduces serum creatinine. Therefore, high&#x2013;normal and minimally elevated serum creatinine values may indicate substantially reduced renal function in older adults (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the use of multiple medications by older adults can affect renal and cardiac function and body water content, thereby increasing susceptibility to fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Routine procedures, such as the vigorous administration of laxatives or enemas before colon x-ray studies, may produce a serious FVD, necessitating the use of IV fluids to prevent hypotension and other effects of hypovolemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance that may produce minor changes in young and middle-aged adults may produce profound changes in older adults. In many older patients, the clinical manifestations of fluid and electrolyte disturbances may be subtle or atypical. For example, fluid deficit may not trigger thirst sensation and can lead to delirium in the older adult (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>). Rapid infusion of an excessive volume of IV fluids can cause fluid overload and cardiac <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page233" title="233"></span>failure in older patients. These reactions are likely to occur more quickly and with the administration of smaller volumes of fluid than in healthy young and middle-aged adults because of the decreased cardiac reserve and reduced renal function that accompany aging (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Dehydration is the rapid loss of body weight due to the loss of either water or sodium. This results in an elevated sodium concentration (Sterns, 2017c). Dehydration in older adults is common because of decreased kidney mass, decreased glomerular filtration rate, decreased renal blood flow, decreased ability to concentrate urine, inability to conserve sodium, decreased excretion of potassium, and a decrease of total-body water. Loss of subcutaneous tissue and resultant thinning of the skin occurs with aging; the dermis is dehydrated and loses strength and elasticity.</p>
