<p class="nonindent">Assessment of hearing and balance involves inspection of the external, middle, and inner ear. Evaluation of gross hearing acuity also is included in every physical examination.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2843">Inspection of the External Ear</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Inspection of the external ear is a simple procedure, but it is often overlooked. The external ear is examined by inspection and direct palpation; the auricle and surrounding tissues should be inspected for deformities, lesions, and discharge, as well as size, symmetry, and angle of attachment to the head. Manipulation of the auricle does not normally elicit pain. If this maneuver is painful, acute external otitis is suspected (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2017</a>). Tenderness on palpation in the area of the mastoid may indicate acute mastoiditis or inflammation of the posterior auricular node. Occasionally, sebaceous cysts and tophi (subcutaneous mineral deposits) are present on the pinna. A flaky scaliness on or behind the auricle usually indicates seborrheic dermatitis and can be present on the scalp and facial structures as well.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2844">Otoscopic Examination</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The tympanic membrane is inspected with an otoscope and indirect palpation with a pneumatic otoscope. To examine the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane, the otoscope should be held in the examiner&#x2019;s right hand, in a pencil-hold position, with the examiner&#x2019;s hand braced against the patient&#x2019;s face (see <a href="#ff59-4">Fig. 59-4</a>). This position prevents the examiner from inserting the otoscope too far into the external canal. Using the opposite hand, the auricle is grasped and gently pulled back to straighten the canal in the adult.</p>
<p class="indent">The speculum is slowly inserted into the ear canal, with the examiner&#x2019;s eye held close to the magnifying lens of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1939" title="1939"></span>otoscope to visualize the canal and tympanic membrane. The largest speculum that the canal can accommodate (usually 5 mm in an adult) is guided gently down into the canal and slightly forward. Because the distal portion of the canal is bony and covered by a sensitive layer of epithelium, only light pressure can be used without causing pain. The external auditory canal is examined for discharge, inflammation, or a foreign body.</p>

<p class="indent">The healthy tympanic membrane is pearly gray and is positioned obliquely at the base of the canal. The following landmarks are identified, if visible (see <a href="c59-sec01.xhtml#ff59-2">Fig. 59-2</a>): the pars tensa, the umbo, the manubrium of the malleus, and its short process. A slow, circular movement of the speculum allows further visualization of the malleolar folds and periphery. The position and color of the membrane and any unusual markings or deviations from normal are documented. Presence of fluid, air bubbles, blood, or masses in the middle ear should also be noted.</p>
<p class="indent">Proper otoscopic examination of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane requires that the canal be free of large amounts of cerumen. Cerumen is normally present in the external canal, and small amounts should not interfere with otoscopic examination. If the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized because of cerumen, the cerumen may be removed using several methods (see later discussion of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1940" title="1940"></span>cerumen removal in section Cerumen Impaction). Cerumen buildup is a common cause of local irritation, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tinnitus:&lt;/b&gt; subjective perception of sound with internal origin; unwanted noises in the head or ear most often described as ringing in the ears">tinnitus</button></strong> (i.e., an unwanted noise commonly described as ringing in the ears), and reversible hearing loss (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2845">Evaluation of Gross Auditory Acuity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A general estimate of hearing can be made by assessing the patient&#x2019;s ability to hear a whispered phrase, testing one ear at a time. The Weber and Rinne tests may be used to distinguish conductive loss from sensorineural loss when hearing is impaired (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). These tests are part of a regular screening physical examination and are useful if a more specific assessment is needed, if hearing loss is detected, or if confirmation of audiometric results is desired.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Whisper Test</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To exclude one ear from the testing, the examiner covers the untested ear with the palm of the hand. The examiner then whispers softly from a distance of 1 or 2 feet from the unoccluded ear and out of the patient&#x2019;s sight. The patient with normal acuity can correctly repeat what was whispered.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Weber Test</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The Weber test uses bone conduction to test lateralization of sound. A tuning fork (ideally, 512 Hertz [Hz]), set in motion by grasping it firmly by its stem and tapping it on the examiner&#x2019;s knee or hand, is placed on the patient&#x2019;s head or forehead (see <a href="#ff59-5">Fig. 59-5</a>A). A person with normal hearing hears the sound equally in both ears or describes the sound as centered in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1941" title="1941"></span>middle of the head. A person with conductive hearing loss, such as from otosclerosis or otitis media, hears the sound better in the affected ear. A person with sensorineural hearing loss, resulting from damage to the cochlear or vestibulocochlear nerve, hears the sound in the better-hearing ear. The Weber test is useful for detecting unilateral hearing loss (see <a href="#tt59-1">Table 59-1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Results of the Weber test are used to determine whether the patient has conductive hearing loss (sounds are heard better in the affected ear) or sensorineural hearing loss (sounds are heard better in the normal ear) (see later discussion of hearing loss).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Rinne Test</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the Rinne test (pronounced <em>rin-ay</em>), the examiner shifts the stem of a vibrating tuning fork between two positions: 2 inches from the opening of the ear canal (for air conduction) and against the mastoid bone (for bone conduction) (see <a href="#ff59-5">Fig. 59-5</a>B). As the position changes, the patient is asked to indicate which tone is louder or when the tone is no longer audible.</p>
<p class="indent">The Rinne test is useful for distinguishing between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. A person with normal hearing reports that air-conducted sound is louder than bone-conducted sound. A person with a conductive hearing loss hears bone-conducted sound as long as or longer than air-conducted sound. A person with a sensorineural hearing loss hears air-conducted sound longer than bone-conducted sound.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2846">Cultural Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Deaf culture:&lt;/b&gt; a community that consists of a group of people who are connected by their use of sign language">Deaf culture</button></strong> is distinguished with an uppercase <em>D</em>, whereas deafness as an audiologic condition is indicated by a lowercase <em>d</em>. In a sociocultural context, Deaf refers to individuals who were born with limited hearing or developed hearing loss before developing a spoken language and who use sign language (e.g., American Sign Language [ASL]) as their primary means of communication (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4245">Pendergrass, Newman, Jones, et al., 2019</a>). Core cultural values include a sacred respect for and use of the hands, disassociation from speech, complete acceptance of being Deaf as a normal existence, full access to communication and information sharing, and self-determination (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4218">Holcomb, 2013</a>; <a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4223">Padden, 1980</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">According to the World Federation of the Deaf (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4254">World Federation of the Deaf [WFD], 2020</a>), membership in the Deaf community depends on self-identification, acceptance of other members, and proficiency in a signed language. The Deaf community rejects the term <em>hearing-impaired</em> as demeaning and use of this term is discouraged (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4218">Holcomb, 2013</a>; <a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Moore &#x0026; Levitan, 2016</a>). Health professionals should be aware of individual differences and use the appropriate terminology when referring to Deaf, deaf, and people who are hard of hearing. Other appropriate terms used to identify Deaf people include Deaf signers, Deaf ASL users, or culturally Deaf adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Deaf and people who are hard of hearing are often hampered by communication barriers and an inadequate level of understanding about their language and culture by the hearing majority (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4218">Holcomb, 2013</a>). When communicating with Deaf signers, nurses need to know that one&#x2019;s ability to speak is irrelevant and asking about the details of one&#x2019;s audiologic status is considered rude unless the individual offers this information (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Mindess, 2014</a>). Although a person who is deaf may have the ability to speak, it is important to remember that speech benefits the hearing population and the individual is in fact, deaf. As patient advocates, nurses should be mindful of the differences and similarities among Deaf signers, nonsigning deaf, and hard of hearing as well as their own beliefs about these differences and similarities (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4235">Lewis &#x0026; Keele, 2020</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c59-sec03.xhtml#ct59-1">Chart 59-1</a>. Although various methods may be necessary, communication should always be based on patient preference.</p>
