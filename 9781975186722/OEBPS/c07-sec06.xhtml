<h4 class="h4" id="s142">Nursing Care of Patients with Chronic Conditions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of patients with chronic conditions is varied and occurs in a variety of settings. Care may be direct or supportive. Direct care may be provided in the clinic or primary care provider&#x2019;s office, a nurse-managed center or clinic, a hospital, long-term care facility, or the patient&#x2019;s home. Direct care includes assessing the patient&#x2019;s physical status, providing wound care, managing and overseeing medication regimens, providing education to the patient and family, and performing technical tasks. The availability of this type of nursing care may allow the patient to remain at home and return to a more normal life after an acute episode of illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Because much of the day-to-day responsibility for managing chronic conditions rests with the patient and the family, nurses often provide supportive care at home. Supportive care may include ongoing monitoring, education, counseling, serving as an advocate for the patient, making referrals, and case management. Giving supportive care is just as important as giving direct physical care. For example, through ongoing monitoring either in the home or in a clinic, a nurse might detect early signs of impending complications and make a referral (e.g., contact the primary health care clinician or consult the medical protocol in a clinic) for medical evaluation, thereby preventing a lengthy and costly hospitalization.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping in mind the many facets and implications of chronic health conditions and their potential impact on patients and families will enable the nurse to provide direct physical care to the patient when warranted, to address the emotional and psychological needs of the patient and family, and to prepare and assist patients and family caregivers to assume management of the condition. By doing so, the nurse can help patients and families maintain as normal a life as possible and as they desire.</p>
<p class="indent">Working with people with chronic illness requires not only dealing with the medical aspects of their disorder but also working with the whole person&#x2014;physically, emotionally, and socially. This holistic approach to care requires nurses to draw on their knowledge and skills, including knowledge from the social sciences and psychology, in particular. People often respond to illness, health education, and regimens in ways that differ from the expectations of health care providers. Although quality of life is usually affected by chronic illness, especially if the illness is severe, patients&#x2019; perceptions of what constitutes quality of life often drive their management behaviors or affect how they view advice about health care. Nurses and other health care professionals need to recognize this, even though it may be difficult to see patients make unwise choices and decisions about lifestyles and disease management. People have the right to receive care without fearing ridicule or refusal of treatment, even if their behaviors (e.g., smoking, substance abuse, overeating, failure to follow health care providers&#x2019; recommendations) may have contributed to their chronic disorder.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s143">Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because chronic conditions are so costly to people, families, and society, two of the major goals of nursing are the prevention of chronic conditions and the care of people with them. This requires promoting healthy lifestyles and encouraging the use of safety and disease prevention measures, such as wearing seat belts and obtaining immunizations. Prevention should also begin early in life and continue throughout life. Education on self-care may need to address interactions among the patient&#x2019;s chronic conditions as well as skills necessary to manage the individual diseases and their interactive effects.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient and family education is an important nursing role that may make the difference in the ability of the patient and the family to adapt to chronic conditions. Well-informed, educated patients are more likely than uninformed patients to be concerned about their health and do what is necessary to maintain it. They are also more likely to manage symptoms, recognize the onset of complications, and seek health care early. Knowledge is the key to making informed choices and decisions during all phases of the chronic illness trajectory.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the importance of educating the patient and the family, the nurse must recognize that patients recently diagnosed with serious chronic conditions and their families may need time to understand the significance of their condition and its effect on their lives. Education must be planned carefully so that it is not acute. Furthermore, it is important to assess the impact of a new diagnosis of chronic illness on a patient&#x2019;s life and the meaning of self-management to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse who cares for patients with chronic conditions in the hospital, clinic, home, or any other setting should assess patient&#x2019;s knowledge about their illness and its management; the nurse cannot assume that patients with a long-standing chronic condition have the knowledge necessary to manage the condition. Patients&#x2019; learning needs change as the chronic condition changes and their personal situations change. The nurse must also recognize that patients may know how their body responds under certain conditions and how best to manage their symptoms. Contact with patients in any setting offers nurses the ideal opportunity to reassess patients&#x2019; learning needs and provide additional education about a chronic condition and its management.</p>
<p class="indent">Educational strategies and materials should be adapted to the individual patient so that the patient and the family can understand and follow recommendations from health care providers. For instance, educational materials should be tailored for people with low literacy levels and available in several languages and in various alternative formats (e.g., Braille, large print, audiotapes). It may be necessary to provide sign language interpreters.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuing and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic illness management is a collaborative process between the patient, family, nurse, and other health care providers. Collaboration extends to all settings and throughout the illness trajectory. Keeping an illness stable over time requires careful monitoring of symptoms and attention to management regimens. Detecting problems early and helping patients develop appropriate management strategies can make a significant difference in outcomes.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 162</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page163" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="163">p. 163</span></div>
<p class="indent">Most chronic conditions are managed in the home. Therefore, care and education during hospitalization should focus on essential information about the condition so that management can continue once the patient is discharged home. Nurses in all settings should be aware of the resources and services available in a community and should make the arrangements (before hospital discharge, if the patient is hospitalized) to secure those resources and services. When appropriate, home care services are contacted directly. The home health nurse reassesses how the patient and the family are adapting to the chronic condition and its treatment and continues or revises the plan of care accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">Because chronic conditions occur worldwide and the world is increasingly interconnected, nurses should think beyond the personal level to the community and global levels. In terms of illness prevention and health promotion, this entails wide-ranging efforts to assess people for risks of chronic illness (e.g., blood pressure and diabetes screening, stroke risk assessments) and group education related to illness prevention and management. In addition, nurses should remind patients with chronic illnesses or disabilities and their families about the need for ongoing health promotion and preventive health screening recommended for all people, because chronic illness and disability are often considered the main concern while other health-related issues are ignored (see <a href="c07-sec03.xhtml#ct7-6">Chart&#x00A0;7-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Telehealth or telehomecare (use of electronic data and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration) has been used effectively to provide care for patients with chronic illness. It is particularly useful in monitoring patients with chronic conditions living in rural areas (<a href="#bib468">Health Resources &#x0026; Services Administration, 2013</a>). It has also been used to deliver select medical and nursing interventions (e.g., counseling) and provide ongoing education and support.</p>
<p class="indent">Transitional care, if available, should be considered and implemented when the patient has MCC, has impaired cognitive status as well as physical limitations, has complex therapies, or is frail or unstable prior to discharge from the hospital to home. Transitional care nurses serve as the primary coordinator of care. These nurses conduct assessments of the patient as well as the family caregivers&#x2019; ability to assist in management of the patient in the home. Nurses in this role help the patient and the family set goals during hospitalization, identify the reasons for the patient&#x2019;s current health status, design a plan of care that addresses them, make home visits, provide telephone support, and coordinate various care providers and services (<a href="#bib489">Naylor et al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s144">Nursing Care for Special Populations with Chronic Illness</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When providing care and education, the nurse must consider multiple factors (e.g., age; gender; culture and ethnicity; cognitive status; the presence of physical, sensory, and cognitive limitations; health literacy) that influence susceptibility to chronic illness and the ways patients respond to chronic disorders. Certain populations, for example, tend to be more susceptible to certain chronic conditions. Populations at high risk for specific conditions can be targeted for special education and monitoring programs; this includes those at risk because of their genetic profile (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for further discussion of genomics and genetics). People of different cultures and genders may respond to illness differently, and being aware of these differences is essential. For cultures in which patients rely heavily on the support of their families, the families must be involved and made part of the nursing plan of care. As the United States becomes more multicultural and ethnically diverse, and as the general population ages, nurses need to be aware of how a person&#x2019;s culture and age affect chronic illness management and be prepared to adapt their care accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to consider the effect of a preexisting disability, or a disability associated with recurrence of a chronic condition, on the patient&#x2019;s ability to manage ADLs, self-care, and the therapeutic regimen. These issues were discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> A 70-year-old man is hospitalized for congestive heart failure. He has an above-the-knee amputation because of an injury that occurred 40 years ago as well as significant hearing loss due to exposure to loud noise in his work and lack of ear protection. In providing discharge planning for him, what evidence-based education is warranted to ensure that he is able to monitor his cardiac status? What evidence-based safety precautions are warranted? How would you modify education because of his hearing loss?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> A 28-year-old woman with paraplegia experienced since she was 14 years of age is hospitalized with a large sacral pressure injury due to her failure to relieve pressure points when in her wheelchair. She is scheduled for surgery to d&#x00E9;bride the pressure injury followed by placement of a graft to the area. She acknowledges that she has difficulty following medical advice and is eager to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible to return home because she becomes depressed when she is away from her home and her boyfriend. What nursing and interprofessional assessments are indicated during your initial interactions with her? What interventions, including education, will you implement during her postoperative recovery? What other interprofessional services might you try to engage so she can make the best transition back to her home setting?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> A 48-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis has experienced frequent relapses, increasing mobility limitations with each relapse, and mild cognitive impairment. She is now hospitalized with a diagnosis of possible pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. Her daughter has asked you, her mother&#x2019;s primary nurse, for assistance in making alternative living arrangements for her mother; the daughter tells you she is exhausted and frustrated by providing care for her mother and her own two children while trying to maintain her full-time job as an administrative assistant. How would you approach this situation? What is your priority in assessing the situation and taking action to assist this family?</p>
