<h4 class="h4" id="s125">Nursing Care of Patients with Disability</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As active members of society, people with disabilities are no longer an invisible minority. An increased awareness of their needs will bring about changes to improve access and accommodations. Modification of the physical environment permits access to public and private facilities and services, including health care, and nurses can serve as advocates for people with disabilities to eliminate discriminatory practices.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s126">Nursing Considerations during Hospitalization</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During hospitalization, as well as during periods of acute illness or injury or while recovering from surgery, patients with preexisting disabilities may require assistance with carrying out ADLs that they could otherwise manage at home <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" title="152"></span>independently and easily. Patients should be asked preferences about approaches to carrying out their ADLs, and assistive devices they require should be readily available. Careful planning with patients to ensure that the hospital room is arranged with their input enables them to manage as independently as possible. For example, patients who have paraplegia may be able to transfer independently from bed to their wheelchair; however, if the bed is left in an elevated position, they may be unable to do so. If patients usually use service animals to assist them with ADLs, it is necessary to make arrangements for the accommodation of these animals.</p>
<p class="indent">If patients with hearing loss or vision impairment are hospitalized, it is essential to establish effective communication strategies. Alternative methods for these patients to communicate with the health care team must be put in place and used, and all staff members must be aware that some patients are not able to respond to the intercom or telephone. If patients have vision impairment, it is necessary to orient them to the environment and talk to them in a normal tone of voice. When a patient has a disability that affects speech, referral with a speech-language therapist or communication specialist may assist in identifying alternative communication methods (use of sounds, gestures, eye movements) between the nurse and the patient. When a person with intellectual, cognitive, or psychiatric-mental health disability is hospitalized, the health care team must determine what strategies are effective in ensuring that the patient understands what is happening and can communicate his or her needs, promoting a safe and nonstressful environment, adhering as closely as possible to the patient&#x2019;s daily patterns, and consulting with the patient&#x2019;s family caregiver.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s127">Health Promotion and Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Health care providers often neglect health promotion concerns of people with disabilities, who may be unaware of these concerns. For example, people who have had hearing loss since childhood may lack exposure to information about new immunizations through television and podcasts. People with lifelong disabilities may not have received information about general health issues as children, and people with new onset as well as lifelong disabilities may not receive encouragement to participate in health promotion activities. Because individuals with disabilities, including those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, are living longer and aging with their disability, the need for health promotion takes on increasing importance. Therefore, nurses should take every opportunity to emphasize the importance of participation in health promotion activities (e.g., healthy diet, exercise, social interactions) and preventive health screening.</p>
<p class="indent">The management of some disabilities increases the risk of illness, and in some people, health screening (e.g., bone density testing, gynecologic examinations, mammography) may be required earlier in life or more frequently (HHS, 2005). Referrals by nurses to accessible sites for screening may be needed, because many imaging centers are inaccessible or staff are unprepared to make modifications for women who need assistance for screening (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">McClintock et al., 2018</a>). In addition, nursing consultation with physical therapists may be needed to identify creative ways of enabling people with disabilities to exercise safely, because exercise facilities are also often inaccessible for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">General health promotion strategies and health-screening recommendations for all men and women also apply to those with disabilities. Although physical limitations, cognitive impairments, and structural and attitudinal barriers existing in clinical facilities may make it difficult for some men and women to obtain health care and preventive health screening, the presence of a disability should not be used as a reason or excuse to defer recommended screening. Rather, the presence of a disability may <em>increase</em> the risk of secondary health conditions or disorders that require screening and follow-up. Just as people without disabilities should have regular screening tests, such as mammography or testicular and prostate examinations, so should people with disabilities. Nurses are often in a position to influence decisions about how equipment and procedures can be adapted to meet the special needs of their patients, whether these needs are cognitive, motor, or communicative.</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of the disabling condition on health risks should be considered. For example, the risk of osteoporosis may be increased in women and men whose disabilities limit their ability to participate in weight-bearing exercise or who use medications that contribute to bone loss (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Smeltzer &#x0026; Qi, 2014</a>). Individuals with intellectual disabilities have several additional risk factors, such as taking medications to treat seizures that contribute to bone loss. Although people with certain disabilities have an increased risk of osteoporosis at a younger age than people without disabilities, little attention is given to prevention, detection, and treatment of osteoporosis, despite the increased risk for falls associated with many disabling disorders.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses can provide expert health promotion education classes that are targeted to people with disabilities and refer them to accessible online resources. Classes on nutrition and weight management are extremely important to people who are wheelchair users and need assistance with transfers. Safer sex classes are needed by adolescents and young adults who have spinal cord injury, TBI, or developmental disabilities, because the threats of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy exist for these populations just as they do for the population in general.</p>
<p class="indent">The need for health promotion in the areas of establishing relationships, sex, pregnancy, and childbearing is as great in people with disabilities, including those with intellectual and cognitive disabilities, as in people without disabilities. However, societal attitudes and biases against sexual relationships and childbearing in people with disabilities often result in health care providers either excluding such individuals from discussions about these issues, or failing to take their interest and questions seriously. Approaching these topics at the point of interest and knowledge level of a patient with a disability is important for sexual health. Furthermore, addressing sexual issues is important to prepare people with disabilities, who are at risk for sexual and other forms of abuse, to distinguish between healthy and abusive or exploitative sexual interactions and relationships. The increased risk for abuse and violence affects both men and women with disabilities; such abuse and violence has potential physical and psychological consequences that must be assessed and addressed (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Dembo, Mitra, &#x0026; McKee, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other healthy behaviors about which people with neurologic disabilities need education include avoiding alcohol and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page153" title="153"></span>nonprescription medications while taking antispasmodic and anticonvulsant medications, which are commonly prescribed for those with disabilities.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Growing attention has addressed health issues of veterans, those individuals who have served in the military, including service-connected disability and chronic illness. There are currently 18.5 million U.S. veterans. Over 41% of those who served in the military after September 11, 2001 (&#x201C;911&#x201D;) in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other war zones have disabilities, which is significantly higher than the rate of 25% of veterans from earlier eras (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018b). Many have more severe disabilities than previous veterans, because of survival of those who previously would have died from their injuries. In addition, the increased use of explosive devices in warfare has increased the number of veterans with limb loss and TBI. The impact of disability on the lives of veterans and their families is considerable and multifaceted and must be considered when providing care to them. Asking patients, &#x201C;Have you ever served in the military?&#x201D; is the first step to identifying health-related issues that veterans face when seeking health care; asking this question also acknowledges the importance of military service to veterans.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s128">Significance of &#x201C;People-First&#x201D; Language</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to all people, both those with and those without disabilities, that they not be equated with their illness or physical condition. Therefore, nurses should refer to all people using &#x201C;people-first&#x201D; language. That means referring to the person first: &#x201C;the patient with diabetes&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;the diabetic&#x201D; or &#x201C;the diabetic patient,&#x201D; &#x201C;the person with a disability&#x201D; rather than the &#x201C;disabled person,&#x201D; &#x201C;women with disabilities&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;disabled women,&#x201D; and &#x201C;people who are wheelchair users&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;the wheelchair bound.&#x201D; This simple use of language conveys the message that the person, rather than the illness or disability, is of greater importance to the nurse.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s129"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The demographic profile in the United States reflects an increased number of older adults with disabilities, with two thirds of Americans 85 years of age and older experiencing functional limitations. Age-related disabilities are those that occur in the older adult population and are thought to be attributable to the aging process. Examples of age-related disabilities include osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and hearing loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Although disability is often perceived as being associated with old age, it occurs across the lifespan; in fact, the majority of people with disabilities are younger than 65 years, with one third between 44 and 65 years of age (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Krahn et al., 2015</a>). While many people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorder) have a slightly shorter lifespan than other people from their age cohort, others live well into adulthood and old age. The number of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities aged 60 years and older is expected to nearly double from 850,600 in 2010 to 1.4 million by 2030 (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Heller, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Aging is an important issue that affects people with preexisting disabilities, as they often develop changes associated with aging at a younger age than do those without disabilities. Therefore, people with preexisting disability should be evaluated for early onset of changes related to aging. The nurse must also consider the effects of aging on a preexisting disability and in turn the effects of disability on aging. The following are examples of changes that occur with aging in people with preexisting disabilities:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>People who use crutches for ambulation because of spina bifida, polio, and lower extremity amputation may experience muscle or joint problems as they age because of long-time overuse of the upper extremities; symptoms may not occur for many years but may cause discomfort and interfere with the person&#x2019;s ability to perform ADLs.</span></li>
<li><span>People who experienced respiratory compromise with the onset of polio decades earlier may experience increasing respiratory symptoms with aging (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib487">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2019</a>). Others experience increased muscle weakness and fatigue, making it necessary to begin to use more extensive assistive devices for mobility (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Duncan &#x0026; Batliwalla, 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Women with long-standing mobility limitations, lack of weight-bearing exercise, and issues associated with intellectual disabilities may experience bone loss and osteoporosis prior to menopause, yet their rate of screening is low (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Dreyfus, Lauer, &#x0026; Wilkinson, 2014</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Heller, 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Smeltzer &#x0026; Qi, 2014</a>).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Concern about what the future holds is common in people aging with preexisting disabilities, who may have questions about what physical, financial, and emotional supports they will have as they age (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib490">Nosek, 2000</a>). For example, if their disability becomes more severe, they may be concerned about entering an assisted living or a long-term care facility. The nurse should recognize the concerns of people with disabilities about their future and encourage them to make suitable plans, which may relieve some of their fears about what will happen to them as they age.</p>
<p class="indent">Aging parents of adult children with intellectual or developmental disabilities often fear what will happen when they are no longer available and able to care for their children. Limited long-term care resources, increased life expectancy for people with developmental disabilities, changing family patterns, and competition with the older adult population for similar resources increase the fears of these parents. Thus, nurses must identify needed community resources and services. Identifying these issues and concerns and assessing arrangements made by aging parents of adult children with disabilities can help reduce some of parents&#x2019; fears about their children&#x2019;s futures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s130">Disability in Medical-Surgical Nursing Practice</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Disability is often considered an issue that is specific or confined to rehabilitation, pediatrics, or gerontologic nursing. However, as noted previously, disability can occur across the lifespan and is encountered in all settings. Patients with preexisting disabilities due to conditions that have been present from birth or to illnesses or injuries experienced as an adolescent or young adult or during middle age often require health care and nursing care in medical-surgical settings. It is important to note that even if a disability has been present <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" title="154"></span>for patients&#x2019; entire lives and they have adapted to it, the disability may still have implications for nursing care and needs to be considered in planning and providing care.</p>
<p class="indent">Although in the past many people with lifelong disabilities or adult onset of severe disabilities may have had shortened lifespans, today most can expect to have normal or near-normal lifespans and to live productive and meaningful lives. They are also at risk for the same acute illnesses that can affect all people and are at increased risk for aging-related chronic diseases due to smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity. In addition, they are at increased risk for unintentional injuries, with fall-related injuries the most common type of injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of unfavorable interactions with health care providers, including negative attitudes, insensitivity, and lack of knowledge, people with disabilities may avoid seeking medical intervention or health care services. For this reason, and because the number of people with disabilities is increasing, nurses must acquire knowledge and skills and be available to assist them in maintaining a high level of wellness. Nurses are in key positions to influence the architectural design of health care settings and the selection of equipment that promotes ease of access and health. Padded examination tables that can be raised or lowered make transfers easier for people with disabilities. Birthing chairs benefit women with disability during yearly pelvic examinations and Pap smears and during urologic evaluations. Ramps, grab bars, and raised and padded toilet seats benefit many people who have neurologic or musculoskeletal disabilities and need routine physical examination and monitoring. When a patient with a disability is admitted to the hospital for any reason, the patient&#x2019;s needs for these modifications should be assessed and addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Men and women with disabilities may be encountered in hospitals, clinics, offices, and nursing centers when they seek health care to address a problem related to their disability. However, they may also be encountered in these settings when they seek care for a health problem that is not related in any way to their disability. For example, a woman with spina bifida, spinal cord injury, or post-polio syndrome might seek health care related to a gynecologic issue, such as vaginal bleeding. Although her disability should be considered in the course of assessment and delivery of health and nursing care, it should not be the exclusive focus of the assessment or care that she receives. Furthermore, neither a severe physical disability that affects a woman&#x2019;s ability to transfer to an examination table for a gynecologic examination nor a cognitive disability should be a reason to defer a complete health assessment and physical examination, including a pelvic examination. Reproductive care for women with disabilities is notoriously lacking due to absence of appropriate accessible equipment and facilities, health care providers&#x2019; unfamiliarity with health issues of women with disabilities, and negative attitudes toward women with disabilities who are sexually active or who are pregnant or considering pregnancy (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib466">Hasson-Ohayon, Hason-Shaked, Silberg, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Hayward et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">LaPierre et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Mitra et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib490">Nosek, 2000</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Tarasoff, 2017</a>). Nurses who are knowledgeable about these issues and other barriers can make a significant impact on the quality of health care these women receive.</p>
<p class="indent">Health care, including preventive health screening and health promotion, is essential to enable people with disabilities to live the highest quality of life within the limitations imposed by their disabling conditions. Men and women with disabilities have the same needs and same rights for health care and preventive health screening as others, although in some cases, the consequences of their disability increase rather than decrease their need for health screening and participation in health-promoting activities. Therefore, it is essential that medical-surgical nurses be knowledgeable about disability and how it affects people across the lifespan as well as how to provide sensitive and quality nursing care for patients with preexisting and new-onset disability. In an effort to address these issues, specific information on health care of people with disabilities has been included throughout this book.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s131">Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><a href="#ct7-6">Chart&#x00A0;7-6</a> contains points the nurse should consider when educating patients about managing disability at home. A major and often overlooked issue in educating patients about a health problem, a treatment regimen, or health promotion strategies is the need for alternative formats to accommodate people with various disabilities. Patients with disabilities are in need of the same information as other patients; however, they often require large print, Braille, audiotapes, or the assistance of a sign language interpreter. Materials may be obtained from a variety of sources for patients who need these educational strategies and for patients with cognitive impairments attributable to developmental disabilities or newly acquired disabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should ensure that all people&#x2014;whether or not they have disabilities&#x2014;recognize the warning signs and symptoms of stroke, heart attack, and cancer, as well as how to access help. In addition, nurses should educate all patients who are stroke survivors and those with diabetes how to monitor their own blood pressure or glucose levels.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuing and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When caring for patients with disabilities and helping them plan for discharge and continuing care in the home, it is important to consider how a particular disability affects a patient&#x2019;s ability to adhere to recommended treatment regimens and keep follow-up appointments. Furthermore, it is important to consider how the health issue or treatment regimen affects the disability. Although many people with disabilities are independent and able to make decisions, arrangements for transportation, and appointments to accessible facilities, others may have difficulty doing so, particularly if they are experiencing a health problem. The nurse should recognize the effect that the disability has on the patient&#x2019;s ability to follow-up. The nurse should ask the patient whether they anticipate having any difficulties arranging for follow-up care. It is important for the nurse to assist the patient with disabilities to identify unmet needs and to find and use resources (community and social resources, and transportation services) that enable the patient to obtain needed services while remaining in his or her home, if preferred. The nurse should have a list of accessible sites and services available and share <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" title="155"></span>those resources with the patient and the family. In collaboration with other health care providers (occupational and physical therapists, speech therapists), the nurse can identify needed home modifications, including those that are simple and inexpensive, that will enable the patient to participate in self-care at home.</p>

<p class="indent">Transitional care, if available, is ideal for patients with severe disabilities being discharged home. Patients hospitalized for an acute or secondary health condition may be more vulnerable to deterioration in health status or developing other health conditions because of their narrow margin of health or deconditioning that occurs with hospitalization. Important roles of the transitional care nurse are to ensure that required services are available in the home at the time of the patient&#x2019;s discharge, to assess and monitor the patient through home visits, and to provide support and assistance to the patient and the family in the aftermath of hospitalization and discharge (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib489">Naylor, Shaid, Carpenter, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
