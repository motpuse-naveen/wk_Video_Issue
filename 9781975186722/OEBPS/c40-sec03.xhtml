<h4 class="h4" id="s1668">Gastric Cancer</h4>
<p class="nonindent">According to the American Cancer Society (ACS, 2020b), an estimated 27,000 Americans were expected to be diagnosed with gastric cancer in 2020, and an estimated 11,000 deaths from the disease were expected to occur that year. Gastric cancer is a more common diagnosis among older adults, with the mean age at diagnosis of 68 years (ACS, 2020b). Men have a higher incidence of gastric cancer than women. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, and Asian/Pacific <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1278" title="1278"></span>Islanders are at higher risk of developing gastric cancer than Caucasian Americans.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer diagnosis, with the highest incidence in Eastern and Central Asia (e.g., Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and Japan) and Latin America (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Rawla &#x0026; Barsouk, 2019</a>). Countries with high incidence of gastric cancer, such as Japan, have implemented mass screening programs, which resulted in earlier diagnosis (at a more curable stage of disease), and may have reduced the number of deaths from gastric cancer (ACS, 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent">Diet appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. A diet high in smoked, salted, or pickled foods and low in fruits and vegetables may increase the risk of gastric cancer (ACS, 2020b). <em>H. pylori</em> infection is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Other factors related to the incidence of gastric cancer include gastritis, pernicious anemia, smoking, obesity, achlorhydria, gastric ulcers, previous partial gastrectomy (more than 20 years ago), and genetics (ACS, 2020b; National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The vast majority of gastric cancers are sporadic or occurring as a result of acquired, not inherited, gene mutations. However, it is understood that gastric cancers may have a familial component (e.g., blood type A and those with another first-degree relative [parent, sibling, or child] with gastric cancer) and are associated with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes (ACS, 2020b; Cabebe, 2020; NCI, 2020). Inherited cancer predisposition syndromes associated with increased risk of developing gastric cancer include hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome (i.e., hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatosis polyposis, and Peutz&#x2013;Jeghers syndrome (ACS, 2020b; Cabebe, 2020; NCI, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The prognosis for patients with gastric cancer is generally poor. The 5-year survival rate for all patients with gastric cancer is about 32% (NCI, 2020). One reason for the poor survival rate is that the diagnosis is usually made late because most patients are asymptomatic during the early stages of the disease. Most cases of gastric cancer are discovered only after the cancer has spread from the stomach to involve the lymph nodes or has metastasized to distant organs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1669">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ninety to 95% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which arise from the mucus-producing cells of the innermost lining of the stomach (ACS, 2020b). Gastric cancer begins with a lesion involving cells on the top layer of the stomach mucosa. The lesion then penetrates cells in the deeper layers of the mucosa, submucosa, and stomach wall. Eventually the lesion infiltrates the stomach wall and extends to organs or structures adjacent to the stomach. Lymph node involvement and metastasis tend to occur early due to the abundant lymphatic and vascular networks of the stomach. Common sites of metastasis include the liver, peritoneum, lungs, and brain (ACS, 2020b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1670">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Gastric cancer is associated with few if any symptoms in the early stages of the disease (ACS, 2020b; Cabebe, 2020). Symptoms of early-stage disease may include pain that is relieved by antacids, resembling those of benign ulcers, and are seldom definitive. Symptoms of advanced disease are similar to those of peptic ulcer disease, such as dyspepsia, early satiety, weight loss, abdominal pain just above the umbilicus, loss or decrease in appetite, bloating after meals, and nausea or vomiting. Fatigue often occurs as a result of the cancer itself or blood loss from the lesion infiltrating the stomach or surrounding tissue (ACS, 2020b; Cabebe, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1671">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The physical examination is usually not helpful in detecting the cancer because most early gastric tumors are not palpable. Advanced gastric cancer may be palpable as a mass. Ascites and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) may be apparent if the cancer cells have metastasized to the liver. Palpable nodules around the umbilicus, called <em>Sister Mary Joseph&#x2019;s nodules,</em> are a sign of a GI malignancy, usually a gastric cancer (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Cabebe, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Esophagogastroduodenoscopy for biopsy and cytologic washings is the diagnostic study of choice, and a barium x-ray examination of the upper GI tract may also be performed (ACS, 2020b; Cabebe, 2020; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Li, Chung, &#x0026; Mullen, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). Endoscopic ultrasound is an important tool to assess tumor depth and any lymph node involvement. Computed tomography (CT) scanning completes the diagnostic studies, particularly to assess for surgical resectability of the tumor before surgery is scheduled. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are valuable in staging gastric cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">A CBC may be used to evaluate for the presence of anemia. Assessment of tumor markers (blood analysis for antigens indicative of cancer), such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9), and CA 50 are monitored to determine the effectiveness of treatment(s). Tumor marker values are usually elevated in the presence of gastric cancer before treatment and decrease if the tumor is responding to the treatment (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Cabebe, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1672">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment of gastric cancer is multimodal, often involving surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy. In general, the patient with a resectable tumor undergoes a surgical procedure to remove the tumor and appropriate lymph nodes. If the tumor can be removed while it is still localized to the stomach, the patient may be cured. In patients with a tumor that is not surgically resectable or those with advanced disease, cure is less likely. Treatment may include surgery to control the cancer growth or for the palliation of symptoms, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A total gastrectomy may be performed for a resectable cancer in the midportion or body of the stomach. The entire stomach is removed along with the duodenum, the lower portion of the esophagus, supporting mesentery, and lymph nodes. Reconstruction of the GI tract is performed by anastomosing the end of the jejunum to the end of the esophagus, a procedure called an <em>esophagojejunostomy.</em> A radical partial (subtotal) gastrectomy is performed for a resectable tumor in the middle and distal portions of the stomach. A Billroth I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1279" title="1279"></span>or a Billroth II operation (see <a href="c40-sec02.xhtml#tt40-4">Table 40-4</a>) is performed. The Billroth I involves a limited resection and offers a lower cure rate than the Billroth II. The Billroth II procedure is a wider resection that involves removing approximately 75% of the stomach and decreases the possibility of lymph node spread or metastatic recurrence. A proximal partial (subtotal) gastrectomy may be performed for a resectable tumor located in the proximal portion of the stomach or cardia. A total gastrectomy or an esophagogastrectomy is usually performed in place of this procedure to achieve a more extensive resection (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Chisti &#x0026; Willner, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery may be also required to treat common complications of advanced gastric cancer, which may include gastric outlet obstruction, bleeding, and severe pain. Gastric perforation is an emergency situation requiring surgical intervention. A gastric resection may be the most effective palliative procedure for advanced gastric cancer. Palliative procedures such as gastric or esophageal bypass, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy may temporarily alleviate symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Palliative rather than radical surgery may be performed if there is metastasis to other vital organs, such as the liver, or to achieve a better quality of life.</p>
<p class="h7">Complications of Gastric Surgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient undergoing gastric surgery may experience complications, including hemorrhage, dumping syndrome, bile reflux, and gastric outlet obstruction. Postoperative bleeding from the surgical site is a common complication of gastric surgery. Bleeding may be severe (hemorrhage) and manifest as vomiting large amounts of bright red blood, which may result in hemorrhagic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). The medical management and nursing care of the patient experiencing hemorrhage is discussed in the Peptic Ulcer Disease section of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dumping syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; physiologic response to rapid emptying of gastric contents into the small intestine; manifested by nausea, weakness, sweating, palpitations, syncope, and possibly diarrhea (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; vagotomy syndrome)">Dumping syndrome</button></strong> may occur as a result of any surgical procedure that involves the removal of a significant portion of the stomach or includes resection or removal of the pylorus (see <a href="c40-sec02.xhtml#tt40-4">Table 40-4</a>). The rapid bolus of hypertonic food from the stomach to the small intestines draws extracellular fluid into the lumen of the intestines to dilute the high concentrations of electrolytes and sugars, which results in intestinal dilation, increased intestinal transit, hyperglycemia, and the rapid onset of GI and vasomotor symptoms (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Kanth &#x0026; Roy, 2019</a>; NIDDK, 2019). It is estimated that 25% to 50% of all patients who have undergone gastric surgery experience at least some symptoms of dumping syndrome (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Kanth &#x0026; Roy, 2019</a>). Early symptoms tend to occur within 10 to 30 minutes after a meal and often include early satiety, cramping abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Vasomotor symptoms may manifest as a headache, flushing and feelings of warmth, diaphoresis, dizziness, palpations, drowsiness, faintness, or syncope. Early symptoms tend to resolve within 1 hour or with bowel evacuation (defecation) (NIDDK, 2019). Later, the rapid elevation in blood glucose is followed by the increased secretion of insulin, which results in hypoglycemia 2 to 3 hours after eating. Manifestations of hypoglycemia may include irritability, anxiety, shakiness, weakness, fatigue, diaphoresis, palpitations, and hunger. Dumping syndrome typically lasts for a few months after surgery, although in some patients, symptoms may persist on a long-term basis.</p>
<p class="indent">Bile reflux may occur with any gastric surgery that involves manipulation or removal of the pylorus, which acts as a barrier to prevent reflex of duodenal contents back into the stomach. Prolonged exposure of bile acid from the duodenum results in irritation and damage to the gastric mucosa, which may lead to gastritis, esophagitis, and possibly peptic ulcer formation. The patient with bile reflux may experience burning epigastric pain that may increase after meals. Vomiting usually does not provide relief from pain. Pharmacologic management of bile reflux includes the administration of proton pump inhibitors and ursodiol. Ursodiol changes the composition of bile, reducing acidity and promoting gastric healing (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Kumar &#x0026; Thompson, 2017</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2988">Li, Zhang, Yao, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Gastric outlet obstruction may occur as a complication of gastric surgery. Postoperative gastric outlet obstruction may be caused by stenosis (narrowing) or stricture (scar tissue) formation at the surgical anastomosis site. Typical clinical manifestations and management of gastric outlet obstruction were previously discussed (see the Peptic Ulcer Disease section of this chapter).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chemotherapy and Targeted Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In instances where the gastric tumor is not resectable, treatment with chemotherapy may offer further control of the disease or palliation. Chemotherapy may also be used in addition to surgery as adjuvant treatment of gastric cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents often include fluorouracil, carboplatin, capecitabine, cisplatin, docetaxel, epirubicin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel. For improved tumor response rates, it is more common to administer combination chemotherapy, primarily fluorouracil-based therapy, with other agents (e.g., fluorouracil plus cisplatin or oxaliplatin) (ACS, 2020b; National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Targeted therapies have become an important addition to the treatment of advanced gastric cancers (NCCN, 2020). Trastuzumab (a recombinant humanized anti&#x2013;HER-2 monoclonal antibody) prescribed in combination with fluorouracil or capecitabine and cisplatin has shown an improvement in survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer who are HER-2 positive (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2994">Miura, Sukawa, Hironaka, et al., 2018</a>). Other targeted therapies are currently being investigated for the treatment of advanced gastric cancers. For example, ramucirumab is currently in clinical trial studies in combination with olaparib for tumors considered to be inoperable (NCI, 2020). Ramucirumab works by blocking VEGFR2, which reduces the blood supply to the tumor to decrease tumor growth (NCCN, 2020; Ramurcirumab, 2020) (<a href="#ct40-3">Chart 40-3</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radiation Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radiation therapy is primarily used for advanced gastric cancers to slow the rate of tumor growth or for the palliation of symptoms related to obstruction, bleeding, and significant pain (ACS, 2020b). Radiation therapy may also be used alone or along with chemotherapy before surgery to decrease the size of the tumor or after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and to delay or prevent reoccurrence of the cancer (ACS, 2020b; NCCN, 2020). Common approaches to radiation therapy for gastric cancer include traditional external-beam radiation therapy or newer specialized approaches to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1280" title="1280"></span>external-beam radiation therapy, such as three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intraoperative radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). These specialized approaches to external radiation therapy precisely direct the radiation beam to the site of the tumor, thus limiting damage to the healthy surrounding tissue (ACS, 2020b; Cabebe, 2020).</p>

<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Should Patients at the End-of-Life Be Enrolled in Clinical Trials?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You are a nurse who works in an outpatient oncology treatment center. R.K. is a 68-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma 13 months ago. She had a gastrectomy and peritonectomy last year, and finished six cycles of chemotherapy 2 months ago. Her most recent postchemotherapy positron emission tomography (PET) scans reveal metastatic disease to her liver, lungs, and pelvis. The oncologist discusses her options with R.K. and her husband, and tells them that R.K. should make preparations for end of life. The oncologist tells them that R.K. can elect to receive palliative chemotherapy, which is associated with good quality of life and extended survival by 2 months in most patients like R.K. who take this option. Another option R.K. might pursue is to enroll in a phase I clinical trial with a novel immunotherapeutic agent. The oncologist is clear that the aim of this treatment would be not to extend R.K.&#x2019;s life, but to test the safety of the new immunotherapy, and that any potential benefits could only be reaped by future patients with gastric cancer. R.K. and her husband decide to go home and discuss her options between themselves. A few days later, they return to the oncology center to tell the oncologist that they wish for R.K. to enroll in the clinical trial. After you finish checking them into an examination room in preparation to see the oncologist, R.K.&#x2019;s husband turns to you with tears in his eyes and says &#x201C;I want my wife to have the very best treatments possible. I will take any chance of a cure for her and this new drug might be the right ticket.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Phase I of a clinical trial is one of the very earliest steps in testing a new therapy. This step in the research process aims to find if the new therapy is safe in humans. The effectiveness of the new therapy in treating a disease is not subject to testing at this early juncture. R.K.&#x2019;s oncologist noted this during discussions with R.K. and her husband. However, it is not uncommon for patients and family members who face a life-threatening diagnosis to misunderstand the aims of an intervention or of enrolling in a research study, and falsely assume that there is indeed a therapeutic aim that does not exist. For this reason, most researchers who conduct clinical trials will give patients written information about the nature of the research to read at home and to give them time to digest and discuss their enrollment in the research study with their friends and family members so that they may make a fully informed decision.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Do you believe that R.K. is making a well-informed decision should she go through with enrolling in the clinical trial?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is it just to not invite patients who are near end of life to participate in research? Is it morally defensible to offer a patient with a terminal diagnosis the option to enroll in a clinical trial when there is no clear potential benefit to them?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What if R.K. turns to you, after her husband voices his hopes for a cure, and says &#x201C;I agree with my husband and I will take any chance I can get!&#x201D; On the other hand, what if she turns to you and says &#x201C;My husband is having a difficult time letting go right now, and I am trying to do my best to support him. I want to do this because I want my death to have some meaning. I want to help future patients with my type of cancer.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be mobilized to be of assistance to you and to R.K. and her husband so that they make the decision that is in R.K.&#x2019;s best interests?</p>

<p class="nonindent">Gastric cancer mostly affects older adults. It is estimated that 6 of every 10 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer each year are 65 years old or older (ACS, 2020c). According to most recent Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, 65.9% of all deaths from gastric cancer occur in patients 65 years old or older (NCI, 2020). Confusion, agitation, and restlessness may be the only symptoms seen in older adult patients, who may have no gastric symptoms until their tumors are well advanced. At this time, they present with reduced functional ability and other signs and symptoms of malignancy.</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery is more hazardous for the older adult, and the risk increases proportionately with increasing age. Nonetheless, gastric cancer should be treated with surgery in older patients. Patient education is important to prepare older patients with cancer for treatment, to help them manage adverse effects, and to face the challenges that cancer and aging present.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A relaxed, nonthreatening atmosphere is provided so the patient can express fears, concerns, and possibly anger about the diagnosis and prognosis. The nurse encourages the family or significant other to support the patient, offering reassurance and supporting positive coping measures. The nurse educates the patient about any procedures and treatments so that the patient knows what to expect.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> O<small>PTIMAL</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse encourages the patient to eat small, frequent portions of nonirritating foods to decrease gastric irritation. Food supplements should be high in calories, as well as vitamins A and C and iron, to enhance tissue repair. Because the patient may develop dumping syndrome when enteral feeding resumes after gastric resection, the nurse explains ways to prevent and manage it and informs the patient that symptoms often resolve after several months. Management of dumping syndrome includes encouraging six small feedings daily that are low in carbohydrates and sugar and the consumption of fluids between meals rather than with meals. If a total gastrectomy is performed, injection of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> will be required for life, because intrinsic factor, secreted by parietal cells in the stomach, binds to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> so that it may be absorbed in the ileum. This deficiency in vitamin B<sub>12</sub> metabolism can result in decreased production of red blood cells, or pernicious anemia. If the patient is unable to eat adequately prior to surgery to meet nutritional requirements, parenteral nutrition may be necessary. Weight loss is a common occurrence in the postoperative period following gastric surgery. Chemotherapy treatment can contribute to ongoing weight loss. Research suggests that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to manage symptoms that may contribute to ongoing weight loss such as early satiety, dysphagia, reflux and regurgitation, and elimination issues (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2971">Aoyama, Sato, Maezawa, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2983">Grace, Shaw, Lalji, et al., 2018</a>). The nurse monitors the IV therapy and nutritional status and records intake, output, and daily weights to ensure that the patient is maintaining or gaining weight. The nurse assesses for signs of dehydration (thirst, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, tachycardia, decreased urine output) and reviews the results of daily laboratory studies to note any metabolic abnormalities (sodium, potassium, glucose, BUN). Antiemetic agents are given as prescribed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse administers analgesic agents as prescribed. A continuous IV infusion of an opioid or a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump set to infuse an opioid may be necessary to mitigate postoperative pain. The frequency, intensity, and duration of the pain are routinely assessed to determine the effectiveness of the analgesic agent. The nurse works with the patient to help manage pain by suggesting nonpharmacologic methods for pain relief, such as position changes, imagery, distraction, relaxation exercises (using relaxation apps and online videos), backrubs, massage, and periods of rest and relaxation. See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion of pain management.</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse helps the patient express fears, concerns, and grief about the diagnosis. The nurse answers the patient&#x2019;s questions honestly and encourages the patient to participate in treatment decisions. Some patients mourn the loss of a body part and perceive their surgery as a type of mutilation. Some express disbelief and need time and support to accept the diagnosis (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct40-4">Chart 40-4</a> for more discussion).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse offers emotional support and involves family members and significant others whenever possible. This includes recognizing mood swings and defense mechanisms (e.g., denial, rationalization, displacement, regression) and reassuring the patient, family members, and significant others that emotional responses are normal and expected. The services of clergy, psychiatric clinical nurse specialists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists are made available, if needed. The nurse projects an empathetic attitude and spends time with the patient. Many patients may begin to participate in self-care activities after they have acknowledged their loss.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Self-care activities depend on the type of treatments used&#x2014;surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliative care. Patient and family education include information about diet and nutrition, treatment regimens, activity and lifestyle changes, pain management, and possible complications (<a href="#ct40-5">Chart 40-5</a>). Consultation with a dietitian is essential to determine how the patient&#x2019;s nutritional needs can best be met at home. The nurse instructs the patient or caregiver about administration of enteral or parenteral nutrition. If chemotherapy or radiation is prescribed, the nurse provides explanations to the patient and family about what to expect, including the length of treatments, the expected side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, neutropenia), and the need for transportation to appointments for treatment. Psychological counseling may also be helpful (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Lee, J. Y., Jang, Y., Kim, S., et al. (2020). Uncertainty and unmet care needs before and after surgery in patients with gastric cancer: A survey study. <em>Nursing &#x0026; Health Sciences</em>, <em>22</em>(2), 427&#x2013;435.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients diagnosed with cancer often experience uncertainty and a variety of other physical, psychological, emotional, and educational needs throughout their illness course. Little is known about unmet care needs across the illness trajectory in patients who have gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is frequently preceded by nonspecific symptoms that patients often attribute to less serious causes; symptom ambiguity at time of diagnosis may contribute to high levels of uncertainty. Varying symptom clusters and levels of symptom intensity and frequency after surgical intervention for gastric cancer may also increase uncertainty. Understanding how uncertainty and needs change over time may help improve the effectiveness of nursing interventions. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of uncertainty and unmet care needs before and after surgery in patients with gastric cancer.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a descriptive study using a before and after design to evaluate uncertainty and unmet care needs at time of diagnosis and after gastrectomy in patients with a diagnosis of gastric cancer. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants 20 years of age or older with a new diagnosis of gastric cancer; patients receiving chemotherapy or with other types of cancer were excluded. Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline. Uncertainty was measured using the <em>Uncertainty in Illness Scale</em> and unmet care needs were examined using the <em>Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form 34</em> at two time points; time 1 (day of admission after diagnosis) and time 2 (first postoperative outpatient follow-up). Both scales were translated to Korean and validated. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and differences in uncertainty and unmet needs from time 1 to time 2 were examined using a dependent <em>t</em>-test.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Eighty-six participants with a mean age of 58.5 years completed the study; the majority were male (58.1%), married (83.7%), and educated at or above a high school level (74.4%). Most had a diagnosis of early gastric cancer (93%), with no family history of cancer (61.6%), or no cancer-related symptoms prior to their diagnosis (59.3%); the majority (81.4%) had sought out information about gastric cancer after their diagnosis. Patients reported moderate levels of uncertainty at time of diagnosis and after surgery; however, total uncertainty scores and the subscales of ambiguity, inconsistency, and unpredictability were significantly higher at time of diagnosis. Needs related to patient care support, psychological status, and health care system information (e.g., disease progression, testing, recovery, self-management) were also significantly higher at time of diagnosis compared to follow-up. However, physical needs (e.g., tiredness, pain, ability to do usual activities/work at home, and feeling unwell) were significantly higher at follow-up. Needs related to sexuality were low at both time points and there were no significant differences in scores from time of diagnosis to postoperative follow-up.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study demonstrates that patients who have gastric cancer experience moderate levels of uncertainty related to symptoms, prognosis, and treatment duration that are higher at time of diagnosis. Patient care needs varied across the course of treatment, which suggests that nurses should perform ongoing assessments in various domains and individualize interventions based on patients&#x2019; priority concerns.</p>

The nurse reinforces nutritional counseling and supervises the administration of any enteral or parenteral feedings; the patient or caregiver must become skillful in administering the feedings and in detecting and preventing untoward effects or complications related to the feedings (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>). The nurse instructs the patient or caregiver to record the patient&#x2019;s daily intake, output, and weight and explains strategies to manage pain, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms. Education is provided on how to recognize and report signs and symptoms of complications that require immediate attention, such as bleeding, obstruction, perforation, or any symptoms that become progressively worse. The nurse must explain the chemotherapy or radiation therapy regimen and ensure that the patient and family or significant other understand the care that will be needed during and after treatments (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Because the prognosis for gastric cancer is poor, the patient, family, or significant other may need assistance with decisions regarding end-of-life care; the nurse should provide support and make referrals as needed.</p>
