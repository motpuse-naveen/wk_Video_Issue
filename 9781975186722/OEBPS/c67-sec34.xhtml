<h4 class="h4" id="s3247">Tick Bites</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tick bites are common in many areas of the United States, and they usually occur in grassy or wooded areas. It is important to learn the place where the bite occurred as well as the location of the bite on the body. The tick bite itself is not usually the problem; rather, it is the pathogen transmitted by the tick that can cause serious disease. Ticks can carry diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, west Nile virus, and Lyme disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Ticks transmit pathogens through their saliva; therefore, the earlier the tick is removed, the better the prognosis. The tick should be removed with tweezers using a straight upward pull (see <a href="#ff67-4">Fig. 67-4</a>), and the patient should be informed of the signs and symptoms of diseases carried by ticks, especially if the patient lives in or has visited an area endemic for tick-related diseases (e.g., Lyme disease) (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">Lyme disease has three stages. Stage I may present with erythema migrans (a classic &#x201C;bull&#x2019;s-eye&#x201D; rash) that typically can be found in the axilla, groin, or thigh area and that appears within 4 weeks after the tick bite, with a peak manifestation time of 7 days after the bite. Classically, this rash is at least 5 cm in diameter with bright red borders. It is accompanied by flulike signs and symptoms that may include chills, fever, myalgia, fatigue, and headache. Without treatment, the rash subsides within 3 to 4 weeks. However, the rash and flulike manifestations can be significantly reduced within days if prompt treatment with antibiotic agents (e.g., doxycycline) is initiated. If antibiotics are not given, stage II Lyme disease may present within 4 to 10 weeks following the tick bite and may manifest with joint pain, memory loss, poor motor coordination, adenopathy, and cardiac abnormalities. Facial nerve palsy is the most common manifestation of stage II Lyme disease (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>). Stage III can begin anywhere from weeks to more than a year after the bite and has serious long-term chronic sequelae, including arthritis, neuropathy, myalgia, and myocarditis. Even after appropriate treatment with antibiotics, 10% to 20% of patients may experience long-term effects including fatigue and arthralgias; some experience neurologic symptoms that may persist for over 10 years (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>).</p>
