<h4 class="h4" id="s546">Viral Rhinitis (Common Cold)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Viral rhinitis is the most frequent viral infection in the general population (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Meneghetti, 2018</a>). The term <em>common cold</em> often is used when referring to a URI that is self-limited and caused by a virus. The term <em>cold</em> refers to an infectious, acute inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, and general malaise. More broadly, the term refers to an acute URI, whereas terms such as <em>rhinitis, pharyngitis,</em> and <em>laryngitis</em> distinguish the sites of the symptoms. The term is also used when the causative virus is influenza (the flu). Colds are highly contagious because virus is shed for about 2 days before the symptoms appear and during the first part of the symptomatic phase.</p>
<p class="indent">Colds caused by rhinoviruses tend to occur in the early fall and spring. Other viruses tend to cause winter colds (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1394">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). Seasonal changes in relative humidity may affect the prevalence of colds. The most common cold-causing viruses survive better when humidity is low, in the colder months of the year.</p>
<p class="indent">Colds are caused by as many as 200 different viruses. Rhinoviruses are the most likely causative organisms. Other viruses implicated in the common cold include coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus. Each virus may have multiple strains; as a result, people are susceptible to colds throughout life (Buensalido, 2019b). Some virus strains may be particularly virulent, causing more severe manifestations than those implicated with common colds, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virion, which caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of a vaccine against the multiple strains of virus is almost impossible. Immunity after recovery is variable and depends on many factors, including a person&#x2019;s natural host resistance and the specific virus that caused the cold. Despite popular belief, cold temperatures and exposure to cold rainy weather do not increase the incidence or severity of the common cold.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s547">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of viral rhinitis may include low-grade fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and nasal discharge, halitosis, sneezing, tearing watery eyes, &#x201C;scratchy&#x201D; or sore throat, general malaise, chills, and often headache and muscle aches. As the illness progresses, cough usually appears. In some people, the virus exacerbates <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;herpes simplex:&lt;/b&gt; a cutaneous viral infection with painful vesicles and erosions on the tongue, palate, gingiva, buccal membranes, or lips (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; cold sore)">herpes simplex</button></strong>, commonly called a <em>cold sore</em> (<a href="#ct18-3">Chart&#x00A0;18-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of viral rhinitis may last from 1 to 2 weeks. If severe systemic respiratory symptoms occur, it is no longer considered viral rhinitis but one of the other acute URIs. Allergic conditions can affect the nose, mimicking the symptoms of a cold.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s548">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management consists of symptomatic therapy that includes adequate fluid intake, rest, prevention of chilling, and the use <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page498" title="498"></span>of expectorants as needed. Warm salt-water gargles soothe the sore throat, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, relieve aches and pains. Antihistamines are used to relieve sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Petroleum jelly can soothe irritated, chapped, and raw skin around the nares (Buensalido, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Guaifenesin, an expectorant, is available without a prescription and is used to promote removal of secretions. Antimicrobial agents (antibiotics) should not be used, because they do not affect the virus or reduce the incidence of bacterial complications. In addition, their inappropriate use has been implicated in the development of organisms resistant to therapy.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Colds and Cold Sores (Herpes Simplex Virus)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Herpes labialis is an infection that is caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Herpes labialis is extremely contagious and can be spread through contaminated razors, towels, and dishes. It is activated by overexposure to sunlight or wind, colds, influenza and similar infections, heavy alcohol use, and physical or emotional stress.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Statistics</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Once the patient is infected with this virus, it can lie latent in the cells. The incubation period is between 2 and 12 d.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Between 50% and 80% of Americans are infected by age 30 y, because HSV-1 is typically transmitted during childhood through nonsexual contact.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Estimates suggest that 80% of people infected are asymptomatic.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Clinical Manifestations</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Herpes labialis is characterized by an eruption of small, painful blisters on the skin of the lips, mouth, gums, tongue, or the skin around the mouth. The blisters are commonly referred to as cold sores or fever blisters.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Early symptoms of herpes labialis include burning, itching, and increased sensitivity or tingling sensation. These symptoms may occur several days before the appearance of lesions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lesions appear as macules or papules, progressing to small blisters (vesicles) filled with clear, yellowish fluid. They are raised, red, and painful and can break and ooze. The lesions typically extend through the epidermis and penetrate into the underlying dermis, consistent with a partial-thickness wound.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eventually, yellow crusts slough over the lesions to reveal pink, healing skin.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Typically, the virus is no longer detectable in the lesion or wound 5 d after the vesicle has developed.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Medical and Nursing Management</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Antiviral medications (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir) may be prescribed to minimize the symptoms and the duration or length of flare-up.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acetaminophen may be given for analgesia.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Topical anesthetics such as lidocaine can help in the control of discomfort.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Occlusive dressings have been shown to speed the healing process. Occlusive ointments with antiviral properties (e.g., docosanol) might be considered for lip and mucosal lesions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Patients should understand that the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Patients should seek treatment with antiviral medications and ointments when they are first experiencing symptoms (e.g., tingling, burning, or itching sensations) as early treatment with these drugs can result in a speedier recovery.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Although herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) typically causes painful vesicular and ulcerative lesions in the genital and anal areas, HSV-1 may also cause genital herpes. Oral&#x2013;genital contact can spread oral herpes to the genitals (and vice versa). People with active herpetic lesions should avoid oral sex.</p>

<p class="indent">Topical nasal decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine nasal and oxymetazoline nasal) should be used with caution. Topical therapy delivers medication directly to the nasal mucosa, and its overuse can produce <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rhinitis medicamentosa:&lt;/b&gt; rebound nasal congestion commonly associated with overuse of over-the-counter nasal decongestants">rhinitis medicamentosa</button></strong>, or rebound rhinitis. Most patients treat the common cold with OTC medications that produce moderate clinical benefits, such as relief of symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, alternative medicines (e.g., echinacea, zinc lozenges, and zinc nasal spray) are frequently used to treat the common cold; however, evidence regarding their effectiveness in shortening the symptomatic phase is limited (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Mousa, 2017</a>). The inhalation of steam or heated, humidified air has been a mainstay of home remedies to treat the common cold; however, the value of this therapy has not been demonstrated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s549">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most viruses can be transmitted in several ways: direct contact with infected secretions, inhalation of large particles from others&#x2019; coughing or sneezing, or inhalation of small particles (aerosol) that may be suspended in the air for up to an hour. Implementation of appropriate hand hygiene measures (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>, <a href="c66-sec02.xhtml#ct66-1">Chart&#x00A0;66-1</a> for further information) remains the most effective measure to prevent transmission of organisms. The nurse educates the patient about how to break the chain of infection with appropriate hand hygiene and the use of tissues to avoid the spread of the virus with coughing and sneezing, and to cough or sneeze into the upper arm if tissues are not readily available. The nurse instructs the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page499" title="499"></span>patient about methods to treat symptoms of the common cold and provides both verbal and written information to assist in the prevention and management of URIs.</p>
