<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fracture:&lt;/b&gt; a break in the continuity of a bone">fracture</button></strong> is a complete or incomplete disruption in the continuity of bone structure and is defined according to its type and extent. Fractures occur when the bone is subjected to stress greater than it can absorb (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>). Fractures may be caused by direct blows, crushing forces, sudden twisting motions, and extreme muscle contractions. When the bone is broken, adjacent structures are also affected, which may result in soft tissue edema, hemorrhage into the muscles and joints, joint dislocations, ruptured tendons, severed nerves, and damaged blood vessels. Body organs may be injured by the force that caused the fracture or by fracture fragments.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1517">Types of Fractures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures types are identified by the name of the injured bone and location (e.g., proximal, midshaft, distal) (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Beutler &#x0026; Titus, 2019</a>). Fractures are also described according to the degree of break (e.g., a <em>greenstick fracture</em> refers to a partial break) or the character of any fractured bone fragments (e.g., a <em>comminuted fracture</em> has more than two fragments). Select specific types of fractures are displayed in <a href="#ff37-2">Figure 37-2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">A <em>closed fracture</em> (simple fracture) is one that does not cause a break in the skin. An <em>open fracture</em> (compound, or complex, fracture) is one in which the skin or mucous membrane wound extends to the fractured bone. Open fractures are often classified using a modified system by Gustilo-Anderson which classifies the severity into three categories based on the extent of soft-tissue injury and the size of the corresponding skin wounds (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Elniel &#x0026; Giannoudis, 2018</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Type I is a clean wound less than 1 cm long and simple fracture pattern.</span></li>
<li><span>Type II is a larger wound with minimal soft tissue damage and no flaps or avulsions.</span></li>
<li><span>Type III (A, B, and C subtypes) is considered the most severe, highly contaminated, and has extensive soft tissue damage; it involves vascular injury or traumatic amputation.</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">An <em>intra-articular fracture</em> extends into the joint surface of a bone. Because each end of a long bone is cartilaginous, if the fracture is nondisplaced, x-rays will not always reveal the fracture because cartilage is nonradiopaque. MRI or arthroscopy will identify the fracture and confirm the diagnosis. The joint is stabilized and immobilized with a splint or cast, and no weight bearing is allowed until the fracture has healed. Because of the damage to articular cartilage, intra-articular fractures often lead to early posttraumatic osteoarthritis (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mittal &#x0026; Mittal, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1518">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical signs and symptoms of a fracture vary according to which bone is affected, the patient&#x2019;s health and age, and the severity of the injury (Whittle, 2017a). However, they often include acute pain, loss of function, deformity, shortening of the extremity, crepitus, localized edema and ecchymosis, muscle spasm, and tenderness (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The pain is continuous and increases in severity until the bone fragments are immobilized. Immediately after a fracture, the injured area becomes numb and the surrounding muscles flaccid. The muscle spasms that accompany a fracture begin shortly thereafter, within a few to 30 minutes, and result in more intense pain than the patient reports at the time of injury. The muscle spasms can minimize further movement of the fracture fragments or can result in further bony fragmentation or malalignment (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Norris, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Loss of Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After a fracture, the extremity cannot function properly because normal function of the muscles depends on the integrity of the bones to which they are attached. Pain contributes to the loss of function. In addition, abnormal movement (false motion) may be present.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Deformity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Displacement, angulation, or rotation of the fragments in a fracture of the arm or leg causes a deformity that is detectable when the limb is compared with the uninjured extremity.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Shortening</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In fractures of long bones, there is actual shortening of the extremity because of the compression of the fractured bone. Sometimes, muscle spasms can cause the distal and proximal site of the fracture to overlap, causing the extremity to shorten (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Norris, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Crepitus</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the extremity is gently palpated, a crumbling sensation, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;crepitus:&lt;/b&gt; grating or crackling sound or sensation; may occur with movement of ends of a broken bone or irregular joint surface">crepitus</button></strong>, can be felt or may be heard. It is caused by the rubbing of the bone fragments against each other.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Localized Edema and Ecchymosis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After a fracture, localized edema and ecchymosis occur as a result of trauma and bleeding into the tissues. These signs may not develop for several hours after the injury or may develop within an hour, depending on the severity of the fracture.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1519">Emergency Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Immediately after injury, if a fracture is suspected, the body part must be immobilized before the patient is moved. Adequate splinting is essential. Joints proximal and distal to the fracture also must be immobilized to prevent movement of fracture fragments. Immobilization of the long bones of the lower extremities may be accomplished by bandaging the legs together, with the unaffected extremity serving as a splint for the injured one. In an upper extremity injury, the arm may be bandaged to the chest, or an injured forearm may be placed in a sling. The neurovascular status distal to the injury should be assessed both before and after splinting to determine the adequacy of peripheral tissue perfusion and nerve function (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Derby &#x0026; Beutler, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">With an open fracture, the wound is covered with a sterile dressing to achieve homeostasis as rapidly as possible at the injury site and to prevent contamination of deeper tissues (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>). No attempt is made to reduce the fracture, even if one of the bone fragments is protruding through the wound. Splints are applied for immobilization.</p>
<p class="indent">In the ED, the patient is evaluated completely. The clothes are gently removed, first from the uninjured side of the body and then from the injured side. The patient&#x2019;s clothing may be cut away. The fractured extremity is moved as little as possible to avoid more damage.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1520">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Reduction</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fracture reduction:&lt;/b&gt; restoration of fracture fragments into anatomic alignment">Fracture reduction</button></strong> refers to restoration of bone fragments to anatomic realignment and positioning with immobilization (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>). Either closed reduction or open reduction may be used to reduce a fracture. The specific method selected depends on the nature of the fracture; however, the underlying principles are the same. Usually, the primary provider reduces a fracture as soon as possible to prevent loss of elasticity from the tissues through infiltration by edema or hemorrhage. In most cases, fracture reduction becomes more difficult as the injury begins to heal (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Before fracture reduction and immobilization, the patient is prepared for the procedure; consent for the procedure is obtained, and an analgesic agent is given as prescribed. Regional anesthesia can also be very useful for pain control with fractures and dislocation reduction (Eiff, Hatch, &#x0026; Higgins, 2020a). The injured extremity must be handled gently to avoid additional damage.</p>
<p class="h7">Closed Reduction</p>
<p class="nonindent">In most instances, closed reduction is accomplished by bringing the bone fragments into anatomic alignment through manipulation and manual traction. The extremity is held in the aligned position while a cast, splint, or other device is applied (see later discussion). Reduction under anesthesia with percutaneous pinning may also be used. The immobilizing device maintains the reduction and stabilizes the extremity for bone healing. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1160" title="1160"></span>X-rays are obtained after reduction to verify that the bone fragments are correctly aligned (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Traction (skin or skeletal) may be used until the patient is physiologically stable to undergo surgical fixation (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="h7">Open Reduction</p>
<p class="nonindent">Some fractures require open reduction. Through a surgical approach, the bone fragments are anatomically aligned. Internal fixation devices (e.g., metallic pins, wires, screws, plates, nails, or rods) may be used to hold the bone fragments in position until solid bone healing occurs (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>). These devices may be attached to the sides of bone, or they may be inserted through the bony fragments or directly into the medullary cavity of the bone (see <a href="#ff37-3">Fig. 37-3</a>). Internal fixation devices ensure firm approximation and fixation of the bony fragments (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>). Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) is a common orthopedic surgical procedure used to treat severe fractures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Immobilization</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the fracture has been reduced, the bone fragments must be immobilized and maintained in proper position and alignment until union occurs. Immobilization may be accomplished by external or internal fixation. Methods of external fixation include bandages, casts, splints, continuous traction, and external fixators.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Maintaining and Restoring Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Reduction and immobilization are maintained as prescribed to promote bone and soft tissue healing. Edema is controlled by elevating the injured extremity and applying ice as prescribed. Neurovascular status is monitored routinely, and the primary provider is notified immediately if signs of neurovascular compromise develop. Restlessness, anxiety, and discomfort are controlled with a variety of approaches, such as reassurance, position changes, and pain-relief strategies, including the use of analgesic medications. Isometric and muscle setting exercises are encouraged to minimize atrophy and to promote circulation. Participation in activities of daily living (ADLs) is encouraged to promote independent functioning and self-esteem. Gradual resumption of activities is promoted as prescribed. With internal fixation, the surgeon determines the amount of movement and weight-bearing stress the extremity can sustain and prescribes the level of activity (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>). See later discussion for more information about caring for patients who have casts, are in traction, or are undergoing surgery for fractures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1521">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Patients with Closed Fractures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a closed fracture has no opening in the skin at the fracture site. The fractured bones may be nondisplaced or slightly displaced, but the skin is intact. The nurse educates the patient regarding the proper methods to control edema and pain (see <a href="#ct37-2">Chart 37-2</a>). It is important to educate about exercises to maintain the health of unaffected muscles and to increase the strength of muscles needed for transferring and for using assistive devices such as crutches, walkers, and special utensils. The patient is also educated to use assistive devices safely. Plans are made to help patients modify the home environment as needed and to ensure safety, such as removing floor rugs or anything that obstructs walking paths throughout the house. Patient education includes self-care, medication information, monitoring for potential complications, and the need for continuing health care supervision. Fracture healing and restoration of strength and mobility may take an average of 6 to 8 weeks, depending on the quality of the patient&#x2019;s bone tissue (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Patients with Open Fractures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In an open fracture, there is a risk for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteomyelitis:&lt;/b&gt; infection of the bone">osteomyelitis</button></strong> (i.e., infection of the bone), tetanus, and gas gangrene (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for discussion of osteomyelitis). The objectives of management are to prevent infection of the wound, soft tissue, and bone, and to promote healing of bone and soft tissue. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given upon the patient&#x2019;s arrival in the hospital along with intramuscular (IM) tetanus toxoid as indicated (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Howe, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Wound irrigation using a sterile isotonic saline solution and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;d&#x00E9;bridement:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of contaminated and devitalized tissues and foreign material">d&#x00E9;bridement</button></strong> (removal of tissues and foreign material) are initiated in the operating room as soon as possible. The wound is cultured, and bone grafting may be performed to fill in areas of bone defects. The fracture is carefully reduced and stabilized by external fixation (see later discussion), and the wound is usually left open. If there is any damage to blood vessels, soft tissue, muscles, nerves, or tendons, appropriate treatment is implemented.</p>

<p class="indent">With open fractures, primary wound closure is usually delayed, particularly with higher-grade fractures. Heavily contaminated wounds are left unsutured and treated with vacuum-assisted closures (VACs) to facilitate wound drainage. Wound irrigation and d&#x00E9;bridement may be repeated, removing infected and devitalized tissue and increasing vascularity in the region (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dunbar &#x0026; Cannada, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The extremity is elevated to minimize edema. Neurovascular status must be assessed frequently. Temperature is monitored at regular intervals, and the patient is monitored for signs of infection. Bone grafting may be necessary to bridge bone defects and to stimulate bone healing (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dunbar &#x0026; Cannada, 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1522">Fracture Healing and Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Weeks to months are required for most fractures to heal. Many factors influence the timeframe of the healing process (see <a href="#ct37-3">Chart 37-3</a>). With a comminuted fracture, bone fragments must be properly aligned to attain the best healing possible. It is essential for the fractured bone to have blood supply to the area to facilitate the healing process. In general, fractures of flat bones (pelvis, sternum, and scapula) heal rapidly. A complex, comminuted fracture may heal slowly. Fractures at the ends of long bones, where the bone is more vascular and cancellous, heal more quickly than do fractures in areas where the bone is dense and less vascular (midshaft). Fractures typically heal more quickly in younger patients (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Howe, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If fracture healing is disrupted, bone union may be delayed or stopped completely. Factors that can impair fracture healing include inadequate fracture immobilization, inadequate blood supply to the fracture site or adjacent tissue, multiple trauma, extensive bone loss, infection, poor adherence to prescribed restrictions (e.g., cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use), malignancy, certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids), older age, and some disease processes (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Howe, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications of fractures may be either acute or delayed. Early complications include shock, fat embolism, acute compartment syndrome, VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and infection (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>). Late complications include delayed union, malunion, nonunion, AVN of bone, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and heterotopic ossification.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Early Complications</h6>
<p class="h7">Shock</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hypovolemic or traumatic shock resulting from hemorrhage is more frequently noted in trauma patients with pelvic fractures and in patients with a displaced or open femoral fracture in which the femoral artery is torn by bone fragments. Treatment for shock consists of stabilizing the fracture to prevent further hemorrhage, restoring blood volume and circulation, relieving the patient&#x2019;s pain, providing proper immobilization, and protecting the patient from further injury and other complications (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>). See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for a discussion of shock.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon17-fat.jpg" alt="icon" /> Fat Embolism Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">Fat embolism syndrome (FES) describes the clinical manifestations that occur when fat emboli enter circulation following orthopedic trauma, especially long bone (e.g., femur) and pelvic fractures. FES is more frequent in closed fractures than in open fractures (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Weinhouse, 2019</a>). At the time of fracture, fat globules may diffuse from the marrow into the vascular compartment. The fat globules (e.g., emboli) may occlude the small blood vessels that supply the lungs, brain, kidneys, and other organs. The onset of symptoms is rapid, typically within 24 to 72 hours of injury, but may occur up to a week after injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>). FES occurs more frequently in males than in females, with its highest incidence in those between the ages of 10 and 40 years.</p>
<p class="h8">Clinical Manifestations</p>
<p class="nonindent">The classic triad of clinical manifestations of FES includes hypoxemia, neurologic compromise, and a petechial rash (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Weinhouse, 2019</a>). The typical first manifestations are pulmonary and include hypoxia, tachypnea, and dyspnea accompanied by tachycardia, substernal chest pain, low-grade fever, crackles, and additional manifestations of respiratory failure. Chest x-ray may show evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or it may be normal. Petechial rash may develop 2 to 3 days after the onset of symptoms. This rash is secondary to dysfunction in the microcirculation and/or thrombocytopenia and is typically located in nondependent regions (e.g., chest, mucous membranes) of the body. There may be varying degrees of neurologic deficits that can include restlessness, agitation, seizures, focal deficits, and encephalopathy (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Fukumoto &#x0026; Fukumoto, 2018</a>). There are no universal criteria for diagnosis of FES; diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion based upon the classic triad of symptoms and imaging findings (Uranslip, Muengtaweepongsa, Chanalithichai, et al., 2018).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Subtle personality changes, restlessness, irritability, or confusion in a patient who has sustained a fracture are indications for immediate arterial blood gas studies.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h8">Prevention and Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention is the most important aspect of treatment; immediate immobilization of fractures, including early surgical fixation, minimal fracture manipulation, and adequate support for fractured bones during turning and positioning, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance are measures that may reduce the incidence of fat emboli. There is no specific treatment for FES; the treatment is supportive. Fluid resuscitation, oxygenation, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and sometimes corticosteroids are used as supportive therapy (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Weinhouse, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Acute Compartment Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">An anatomic compartment is an area of the body encased by bone or fascia (e.g., the fibrous membrane that covers and separates muscles) that contains muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. The human body has 46 anatomic compartments, and 36 of these are located in the extremities (see Fig.&#x00A0;37-4). Acute compartment syndrome, a time-sensitive surgical emergency, is characterized by the elevation of pressure within an anatomic compartment that is above normal perfusion pressure. Acute compartment syndrome arises from an increase in compartment volume (e.g., from edema or bleeding), a decrease in compartment size (e.g., from a restrictive cast), or aspects of both. When the pressure within an affected compartment rises above normal, perfusion to the tissues is impaired, causing cell death, which may lead to tissue necrosis and permanent dysfunction (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Papachristos &#x0026; Giannoudis, 2018</a>). The most common cause is fractures, with tibial fractures having the highest risk (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Long, Koyfman, &#x0026; Gottlieb, 2019</a>). Acute compartment syndrome is most common among young adults, and although it may take up to 48 hours for symptoms to present, it typically has a rapid progression of symptoms and signs over a few hours after the initial injury or fracture repair (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Stracciolini &#x0026; Hammerberg, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</p>
<p class="nonindent">Frequent assessment of neurovascular function after a fracture is essential and focuses on the &#x201C;five Ps&#x201D;: <strong><em>p</em></strong>ain, <strong><em>p</em></strong>allor, <strong><em>p</em></strong>ulselessness, <strong><em>p</em></strong>aresthesia, and <strong><em>p</em></strong>aralysis (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Papachristos &#x0026; Giannoudis, 2018</a>). The patient with acute compartment syndrome typically presents with severe pain that is out of proportion to the injury, which is considered the cardinal symptom (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Stracciolini &#x0026; Hammerberg, 2019</a>). Additionally, patients often describe this pain as deep and burning, and that it is unrelieved by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1163" title="1163"></span>medications. Exacerbation of pain on passive stretching of the muscles within the involved compartment is highly predictive (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2758">McMillan, Gardner, Schmidt, et al., 2019</a>). With continued nerve ischemia and edema, the patient experiences diminished sensation followed by complete numbness. Motor weakness may occur as a late sign of nerve ischemia. Motion is evaluated by asking the patient to flex and extend the wrist or plantar flex and dorsiflex the foot. Paralysis (no movement) is a late finding after prolonged ischemia and is associated with neurovascular injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">McMillan et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff37-4">

<img src="images/ff37-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff37-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;37-4 &#x2022;</span> <strong>A.</strong> Cross-section of normal lower leg with muscle compartments. <strong>B.</strong> Cross-section of lower leg with compartment syndrome.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Peripheral circulation is evaluated by assessing color, temperature, capillary refill time, edema, and pulses. Cyanotic nail beds suggest venous congestion. Pallor or dusky and cold digits, prolonged capillary refill time, and diminished pulses suggest impaired arterial perfusion. Edema may obscure the function of arterial pulsation, and Doppler ultrasonography may be used to verify a pulse. Pulselessness is a late sign (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">McMillan et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A prompt diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome is based on clinical suspicion and repeated clinical examinations of the &#x201C;five Ps&#x201D;; however, it is important to keep in mind that pain is a subjective measure and may only be detected in patients who are conscious (AAOS, 2018). As well, some of the clinical signs and symptoms may only present in the late stages of acute compartment syndrome (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Stracciolini &#x0026; Hammerberg, 2019</a>). Palpation of the muscle, if possible, reveals it to be swollen and hard with the skin taut and shiny. The orthopedic surgeon may measure tissue pressure by inserting a tissue pressure-monitoring device, such as a handheld direct injection device (e.g., Stryker Intra-Compartmental Pressure Monitor), into the muscle compartment (normal pressure is 8 mm Hg or less) (see <a href="#ff37-5">Fig. 37-5</a>). Nerve and muscle tissues deteriorate as compartment pressure increases. Prolonged pressure of more than 30 mm Hg can result in irreversible changes (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Long et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prompt management of acute compartment syndrome is essential and includes relieving all external pressure on the compartment. The orthopedic surgeon needs to be notified immediately if neurovascular compromise is suspected. Delay in treatment may result in permanent nerve and muscle damage, necrosis, infection, rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury, and amputation (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Stracciolini &#x0026; Hammerberg, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If conservative measures do not restore tissue perfusion and relieve pain, a fasciotomy (surgical decompression with excision of the fascia) is considered the definitive treatment to relieve the constrictive muscle fascia (AAOS, 2018). After fasciotomy, the wound is not sutured but is left open to allow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1164" title="1164"></span>the muscle tissues to expand; it is covered with moist, sterile saline dressings or with artificial skin. Negative-pressure wound therapy using a vacuum dressing has been shown to be effective to remove fluids and decrease times to primary closure (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Modrall, 2019</a>). The affected arm or leg is splinted in a functional position and elevated to heart level and prescribed intermittent passive ROM exercises are usually performed. In 2 to 3 days, when the swelling has resolved and tissue perfusion has been restored, the wound is d&#x00E9;brided and closed (possibly with skin grafts).</p>

<p class="h8">Nursing Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should frequently assess pain and neurovascular status of the affected limb and report any negative changes that may suggest compartment syndrome immediately to the primary provider. The limb should be maintained in a functional position at the level of the heart to promote optimal blood flow.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Acute compartment syndrome is managed by maintaining the extremity at heart level (not above heart level) and removing constrictive dressings by opening and bivalving the cast or opening the splint, if one or the other is present.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Pain management is essential and is accomplished with opioid analgesia, as prescribed. Careful assessment of intake and output and urinalysis could alert the nurse to the development of rhabdomyolysis (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Education is necessary for those patients discharged to home-based or community settings with fractures and casts and should include recognition of the unique characteristics of acute compartment syndrome (increasing, refractory pain and neurovascular manifestations) and instructions when to contact the primary provider for emergent follow-up.</p>
<p class="h7">Other Early Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">VTE, including DVT and PE, are associated with reduced skeletal muscle contractions and bed rest. Patients with fractures of the lower extremities and pelvis are at high risk for VTE (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>). PE may cause death several days to weeks after injury. See <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for a discussion of VTE, PE, and DVT.</p>
<p class="indent">Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic disorder that results in widespread hemorrhage and microthrombosis with ischemia. Its causes are diverse and can include massive tissue trauma. Early manifestations of DIC include ecchymoses, unexpected bleeding after surgery and bleeding from the mucous membranes, venipuncture sites, and gastrointestinal and urinary tracts (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Iyer, 2019</a>). See <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for discussion of treatment for DIC.</p>
<p class="indent">All open fractures are considered contaminated and are treated as soon as possible with copious irrigation, d&#x00E9;bridement, tetanus immunization/prophylaxis, and IV antibiotics (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schaller, 2018</a>). Surgical internal fixation of fractures carries a risk of infection. The nurse must monitor and educate the patient regarding signs and symptoms of infection, including tenderness, pain, redness, swelling, local warmth, elevated temperature, and purulent drainage.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Delayed Complications</h6>
<p class="h7">Delayed Union, Nonunion, and Malunion</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;delayed union:&lt;/b&gt; prolongation of expected healing time for a fracture">Delayed union</button></strong> occurs when healing does not occur within the expected timeframe for the location and type of fracture. Delayed union may be associated with distraction (pulling apart) of bone fragments, systemic or local infection, poor nutrition, or comorbidity (e.g., diabetes, autoimmune disease). The healing time is prolonged, but the fracture eventually heals (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Nyary &#x0026; Scammell, 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nonunion:&lt;/b&gt; failure of fractured bones to heal together">Nonunion</button></strong> is an incomplete healing of a fracture and results from failure of the ends of a fractured bone to unite, whereas <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;malunion:&lt;/b&gt; healing of a fractured bone in a malaligned position">malunion</button></strong> is the healing of a fractured bone in a malaligned (deformed) position (see <a href="#ff37-6">Fig. 37-6</a>). In both of these instances, the patient complains of persistent discomfort and abnormal movement at the fracture site. Nonunion occurs most commonly in tibial fractures, whereas malunion occurs most commonly in fractures of the hand (or fingers) (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Howe, 2018</a>). Factors contributing to delayed union, nonunion, and malunion are those associated with impaired bone healing (see <a href="#ct37-3">Chart 37-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Impaired bone healing can be treated with nonsurgical and surgical interventions. Nonsurgical treatment modalities include low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and externally applied electrical bone growth stimulators (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Osman, Gabr, &#x0026; Haddad, 2019</a>). Electrical stimulation techniques enhance the process of bone healing by exposure of osteoblasts to electromagnetic fields, which stimulate the secretion of growth factors (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2688">Bhavsar, Leppik, Oliveira, et al., 2019</a>). In some cases, electrical bone stimulators can also be invasive: completely implanted or partially implanted in the form of pins to the site of impaired healing (see <a href="#ff37-7">Fig. 37-7</a>). Surgical interventions include bone grafts and internal and external fixation (Weinlein, 2017; Whittle, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent">Grafted bone undergoes a reconstructive process that results in a gradual replacement of the graft with new bone. During surgery, the bone fragments are d&#x00E9;brided and aligned, infection (if present) is removed, and a bone graft is placed in the bony defect. The bone graft may be an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;autograft:&lt;/b&gt; heart valve replacement made from the patient&#x2019;s own heart valve (e.g., pulmonic valve excised and used as an aortic valve)">autograft</button></strong> (tissue, frequently from the iliac crest, harvested from the patient for their own use; also called autogenous), an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;allograft:&lt;/b&gt; tissue harvested from a donor for use in another person">allograft</button></strong> (tissue <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1165" title="1165"></span>harvested from a donor), or a bone graft substitute (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2683">Baldwin, Li, Auston, et al., 2019</a>). The bone graft fills the bone gap and provides a lattice structure for invasion by bone cells and actively promotes bone growth. The type of bone selected for grafting depends on function&#x2014;cortical bone is used for structural strength, cancellous bone for osteogenesis, and corticocancellous bone for strength and rapid incorporation (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Baldwin et al., 2019</a>). Free vascularized bone autografts are grafted with their own blood supply, allowing for primary fracture healing.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff37-7">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff37-7.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff37-7.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;37-7 &#x2022;</span> Bone healing stimulator applied to the arm. Reprinted with permission from EBI Medical Systems, Parsippany, NJ.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">After grafting, immobilization and non&#x2013;weight-bearing restrictions are required while the bone graft becomes incorporated and the fracture or defect heals, which may be confirmed on an x-ray (Whittle, 2017b). Depending on the type of bone grafted and the age of the patient, healing may take from 6 to 12 months or longer. Bone grafting complications include wound or graft infection, fracture of the graft, and nonunion. Specific problems associated with autografts include a limited quantity of bone available for harvest and harvest site pain that may persist for up to 2 years after harvest. Infrequent specific allograft complications include partial acceptance (lack of host and donor histocompatibility, which retards graft incorporation), graft rejection (rapid and complete resorption of the graft), and transmission of disease (rare) (Whittle, 2017b).</p>
<p class="h8">Nursing Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a nonunion has experienced an extended time in fracture treatment and may become frustrated with prolonged therapy. The nurse provides emotional support and encouragement to the patient and encourages adherence to the treatment regimen. The orthopedic surgeon evaluates the progression of bone healing with periodic x-rays.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care for the patient with a bone graft includes providing pain management and monitoring the patient for possible complications. The nurse needs to reinforce educational information concerning the objectives of the bone graft, immobilization, non&#x2013;weight-bearing regimen and exercises, wound care, monitoring for signs of infection, and the importance of follow-up care with the orthopedic surgeon (Whittle, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care for the patient using a bone growth stimulator focuses on patient education that addresses immobilization, weight-bearing restrictions, and correct use of the stimulator as prescribed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Avascular Necrosis of Bone (AVN; Osteonecrosis)</p>
<p class="nonindent">AVN occurs when the bone loses its blood supply and dies; the process eventually leads to bony collapse and destruction of the associated joint. It may occur after a fracture with disruption of the blood supply to the distal area. It is also seen with prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy, exposure to radiation, sickle cell disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases; chronic alcohol use and cigarette smoking are other atraumatic etiologies (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Graham, 2020</a>). The process is often progressive, and the patient develops pain with movement that progresses to pain at rest. Diagnostics include history and physical examination with x-rays, CT scans, and bone scans. AVN of the hip is the most commonly affected site; the knee is the second most common site. The goal of treatment is to preserve the native joint for as long as possible and includes both conservative and surgical interventions (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Graham, 2020</a>). Nonoperative management includes activity modification, administration of analgesics, and partial weight bearing of the affected region. Joint preserving procedures are aimed at revascularizing the affected area by drilling the avascular segment or using a bone marrow graft. In extreme cases, it is advisable to remove the fragment and reconstruct the joint (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Jones &#x0026; Mont, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</p>
<p class="nonindent">CRPS is a complex and rare disorder characterized by regional pain in a limb that is disproportionate; it typically begins following a fracture, soft tissue injury, or surgery. Dysfunctional peripheral and central nervous system responses that mount an excessive response to the precipitating event (e.g., fracture, surgery) are thought to be the cause of the pain. Women are affected more often than men, and the average age of diagnosis is 40 years (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2768">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], 2017</a>). Two subtypes of CRPS have been recognized: Type I (formerly called <em>reflex sympathetic dystrophy</em>) applies to patients with CRPS without evidence of peripheral nerve injury, and Type II (formerly called <em>causalgia)</em> refers to patients with nerve injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Abdi, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical manifestations of CRPS include severe burning pain, local edema, hyperesthesia, stiffness, discoloration, vasomotor skin changes (e.g., fluctuating warm, red, dry and cold, sweaty, cyanotic), and trophic changes that may include glossy, shiny skin, and changes in hair and nail growth. This syndrome is frequently chronic, with extension of symptoms to adjacent areas of the body. Dysfunction of the affected limb may also be manifested in CRPS. The diagnosis is made through the history and physical examination and ruling out other organic causes (NINDS, 2017).</p>
<p class="h8">Nursing Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">The primary objective of treatment is physical functional maintenance or recovery of physical function (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Stanton-Hicks, 2018</a>). Early effective pain relief is the focus of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1166" title="1166"></span>management. Pain may be controlled with analgesic agents. NSAIDs, topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine patches), corticosteroids, and opioids. Anticonvulsant agents (e.g., gabapentin) and antidepressant agents (e.g., amitriptyline) can be effective in treating neuropathic pain. Additional treatments may include sympathetic nerve blocks, neural stimulation, and intrathecal delivery of prescribed medications. Novel treatments under investigation include infusions of immunoglobulin (IVIG) and ketamine and the use of hyperbaric oxygen (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Abdi, 2020</a>). The nurse evaluates the effectiveness of these interventions and therapies (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) and helps the patient cope with CRPS manifestations through therapeutic listening, initiation of relaxation techniques and behavior modification, and referral for rehabilitation therapy. Rehabilitation initiated early can improve circulation to the affected area and maximize function. Depression and anxiety are often associated with severe pain disorders; therefore, the nurse should recommend a mental health referral as necessary (NINDS, 2017).</p>

<p class="h7">Heterotopic Ossification</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;heterotopic ossification:&lt;/b&gt; misplaced formation of bone">Heterotopic ossification</button></strong> refers to benign bone growth in an atypical location, such as in the soft tissue (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Speed, 2019</a>). Heterotopic ossification that is categorized as traumatic myositis ossificans usually develops in response to soft tissue trauma (e.g., contusion, sprain). It is characterized by pain and joint stiffness that causes decreased ROM. It typically occurs in young males after musculoskeletal sports injuries (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2761">Meyers, Lisiecki, Miller, et al., 2019</a>). If significant ROM dysfunction persists, surgery may be indicated to remove the bone growth and restore function (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Speed, 2019</a>).</p>
