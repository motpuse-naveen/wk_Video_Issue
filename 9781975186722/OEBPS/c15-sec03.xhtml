<p class="nonindent">Several types of surgical robots are used to facilitate the performance of minimally invasive procedures. These techniques were first introduced in the 1980s in an effort to overcome the disadvantages of traditional laparoscopic surgery, such as limited arm movement and view (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Carlos &#x0026; Saulan, 2018</a>). Many surgical specialties have the ability to use robotic technology for surgical cases, particularly those in the cardiac, urologic, thoracic, and gynecologic specialties. Several types of robotic-driven tools assist in making surgery more precise and less invasive for patients. Technologic advancements of the robot include 3D high-definition imaging and better motion control of instrumentation. The articulated arms offer a 360-degree wristlike movement for precision grasping, manipulation, dissection, and suturing of tissue (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Phillips, 2017</a>).</p>
