<h4 class="h4" id="s1146">Bleeding Disorders</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The failure of normal hemostatic mechanisms can result in bleeding which may be severe. Bleeding is commonly provoked by trauma; however, in certain circumstances, it can occur spontaneously. The causes of bleeding disorders can be categorized based upon whether there is a deficiency of platelets or a defect in the platelets, or based upon whether <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page931" title="931"></span>there is an inherited or acquired coagulation factor abnormality, or based upon a defect in the vasculature. When the cause is platelet or coagulation factor abnormalities, bleeding can occur anywhere in the body. When the source is a vascular abnormality the site of bleeding is more localized. Some patients may have simultaneous defects in more than one hemostatic mechanism.</p>

<p class="indent">The bone marrow may be stimulated to increase platelet production. This can be a reactive response to significant bleeding, or a more general response to increased hematopoiesis, as in iron deficiency anemia. Sometimes an increase in platelets does not result from increased platelet production, but from a loss of platelet pooling in the spleen. The spleen typically holds about one third of circulating platelets at any time. If the spleen is absent (e.g., after splenectomy) the platelet reservoir is lost, and an abnormally high number of platelets enter the circulation. Eventually the rate of platelet production slows to reestablish a more normal platelet level.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1147">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of bleeding disorders vary according to the type of defect. A careful history and physical examination can be useful in determining the source of the hemostatic defect. Abnormalities of the vascular system are sources of localized bleeding, usually into the skin. Because platelets are primarily responsible for stopping bleeding from small vessels, patients with decreased platelets develop <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;petechiae:&lt;/b&gt; tiny capillary hemorrhages">petechiae</button></strong>, often in clusters. These lesions can be seen on the skin and mucous membranes and occur throughout the body (see <a href="#ff29-4">Fig. 29-4</a>). Bleeding from platelet disorders can be severe, but most often, bleeding from platelet disorders can be controlled when pressure is applied.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, coagulation factor defects do not tend to cause superficial bleeding because the primary hemostatic mechanisms are still intact. Instead, bleeding occurs deeper within the body (e.g., subcutaneous or intramuscular hematomas, hemorrhage into joint spaces). External bleeding diminishes very slowly when local pressure is applied; it frequently recurs several hours after pressure is removed. An example of this would be severe bleeding that occurs several hours after tooth extraction. Risk factors for bleeding are listed in <a href="c29-sec07.xhtml#ct29-6">Chart 29-6</a>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1148">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management varies based on the underlying bleeding disorder. If bleeding is significant, transfusion of blood products may be indicated. The specific blood product used is determined by the underlying defect and the extent of blood loss. If fibrinolysis is excessive, hemostatic agents such as aminocaproic acid can be useful to inhibit the process, but this agent must be used cautiously because excessive inhibition of fibrinolysis can lead to thrombosis. A patient scheduled for an invasive procedure may need to have transfusions of select blood products to reduce risk for excessive bleeding.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1149">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who have bleeding disorders or who have the potential for development of such disorders as a result of disease or therapeutic agents must be educated to monitor themselves frequently and carefully for signs of bleeding (see <a href="#ct29-8">Chart 29-8</a>). They should understand the importance of avoiding activities that increase the risk for bleeding, such as contact sports. The skin should be examined for evidence of bleeding, including petechiae and ecchymoses (bruises) and the nose and gums should also be examined for bleeding. When bleeding disorders are severe, patients who are hospitalized are monitored for bleeding by testing all drainage and excreta (feces, urine, emesis, and, gastric drainage) for obvious and occult blood.</p>
