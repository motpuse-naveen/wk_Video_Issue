<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps_un15">Y</span>ou are the nurse caring for a 70-year-old man with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease who was recently admitted to the skilled nursing facility where you work. The patient was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease 5 years ago but has only recently had a significant decline in function. He can no longer dress himself because he lacks the ability to control fine motor movements in his hands. In addition, he has lost 10 lb in the past 3 months as a result of difficulty feeding himself because of the constant tremors. The patient&#x2019;s wife has reported feeling exhausted prior to her husband&#x2019;s admission; she had not been sleeping well due to her husband having nightmares and trying to get up during the night. You form a task force to help develop a plan of care that is focused on increasing the patient&#x2019;s functionality so that he might be discharged home. Specifically, you invite a staff nutritionist, pharmacist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and social worker to work with you in developing the plan of care for this patient.</p>
<p class="UMUNT1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1965" title="1965"></span>QSEN Competency Focus: <span class="black">Teamwork and Collaboration</span></p>
<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
