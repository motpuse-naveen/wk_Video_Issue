<h4 class="h4" id="s3007">Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Spinal cord injury (SCI)</strong>, an injury to the spinal cord, vertebral column, supporting soft tissue, or intervertebral discs caused by trauma is a major health disorder. In the United States, approximately 294,000 persons are living with an SCI. An estimated 17,810 new cases occur annually; common causes are motor vehicle crashes, falls, violence (predominantly gunshot wounds), and sports-related injuries (<a href="#bib4414">National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center [NSCISC], 2020</a>). Males account for 78% of patients with SCI. The average age of injury is 43 years of age (NSCISC, 2020). The indirect cost for the care of patients with SCI averages about $77,701 per patient per year in 2019 dollars (NSCISC, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The predominant risk factors for SCI include younger age, male gender, and alcohol and illicit drug abuse. The frequency with which these risk factors are associated with SCI serves to emphasize the importance of primary prevention. The same interventions suggested earlier in this chapter for head injury prevention help decrease the incidence of SCI (see <a href="c63-sec01.xhtml#ct63-1">Chart 63-1</a>). Life expectancy continues to increase for people with SCI because of improved health care but remains slightly lower than for those without SCI. The major causes of death are pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and sepsis (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;paraplegia:&lt;/b&gt; paralysis of the lower extremities with dysfunction of the bowel and bladder from a lesion in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral region of the spinal cord">Paraplegia</button></strong> (paralysis of the lower body) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tetraplegia:&lt;/b&gt; varying degrees of paralysis of both arms and legs, with dysfunction of bowel and bladder from a lesion of the cervical segments of the spinal cord; formerly called &lt;em&gt;quadriplegia&lt;/em&gt;">tetraplegia</button></strong> (paralysis of all four extremities; formerly called <em>quadriplegia</em>) can occur, with incomplete tetraplegia being the most frequently occurring injury, followed by complete paraplegia, complete tetraplegia, and incomplete paraplegia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3008">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Damage in SCI ranges from transient concussion (from which the patient fully recovers) to contusion, laceration, and compression of the spinal cord tissue (either alone or in combination), to complete <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;transection:&lt;/b&gt; severing of the spinal cord; transection can be complete (all the way through the cord) or incomplete (partially through)">transection</button></strong> (severing) of the spinal cord (which renders the patient paralyzed below the level of the injury). The vertebrae most frequently involved are the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical vertebrae (C5&#x2013;C7), the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12), and the first lumbar vertebra (L1). These vertebrae are most susceptible because there is a greater range of mobility in the vertebral column in these areas (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">SCI can be separated into two categories: primary injuries and secondary injuries. Primary injuries are the result of the initial insult or trauma and are usually permanent. Secondary injuries resulting from SCI include edema and hemorrhage (<a href="#bib4432">Venkatesh, Ghosh, Mullick, et al., 2019</a>). The secondary injury is a major concern for critical-care nurses. Early treatment is essential to prevent partial damage from becoming total and permanent.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3009"> <img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Veterans account for a large proportion of those living with SCI (<a href="#bib4405">Gary, Cao, Burns, et al., 2020</a>). Veterans who have suffered an SCI are significantly older and predominantly male compared to civilians with SCI (<a href="#bib4447">Furlan, Kurban, &#x0026; Craven, 2019</a>). However, the level of injury, severity, mechanisms of injury, and need for mechanical ventilation after the SCI are all similar to civilians (<a href="#bib4447">Furlan et al., 2019</a>). Veterans with war-related SCIs are predominantly young, White, and male; they have commonly sustained thoracic, severe, SCI caused by gunshot or explosion; and they often have at least one other bodily injury in addition to SCI (<a href="#bib4447">Furlan, Gulasingam, &#x0026; Craven, 2017</a>). Differences between veterans and civilians with SCI may influence adjustment and functional outcomes. For example, factors such as the high rates of posttraumatic stress syndrome, the need to accommodate to civilian life, and the burden of not being able to serve increase the risk for poorer health and unhealthy behaviors, mental health problems, and substance use disorder (<a href="#bib4447">Gary et al., 2020</a>). Veterans with SCI have higher cognitive function, social integration, self-perceived independence, and social support, as well as less pain and fewer secondary impairments than civilians with SCI. They also have better physical independence and mobility (<a href="#bib4447">Gary et al., 2020</a>). Among civilians, there is a greater likelihood of employment post SCI for non-Hispanic White men with a college education. However, veterans with SCI lesions higher in the spinal cord are less likely to be employed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3010">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Manifestations of SCI depend on the type and level of injury (see <a href="#ct63-7">Chart 63-7</a>). The type of injury refers to the extent of injury to the spinal cord itself. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;complete spinal cord lesion:&lt;/b&gt; a condition that involves total loss of sensation and voluntary muscle control below the lesion">complete spinal cord lesion</button></strong> signifies loss of both sensory and voluntary motor communication from the brain to the periphery, resulting in paraplegia or tetraplegia. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;incomplete spinal cord lesion:&lt;/b&gt; a condition in which there is preservation of the sensory or motor fibers, or both, below the lesion">Incomplete spinal cord lesion</button></strong> denotes that the ability of the spinal cord to relay messages to and from the brain is not completely absent. Sensory and/or motor fibers are preserved below the lesion. Injuries are classified according to the area of spinal cord damage: central, lateral, anterior, or peripheral (see <a href="#ct63-7">Chart 63-7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) provides classification of SCI according to the degree of sensory and motor function present after injury (ASIA, 2019; see Fig.&#x00A0;63-4). The neurologic level refers to the lowest level at which sensory and motor functions are intact. Below the neurologic level, there may be total or partial, sensory and/or motor paralysis (dependent upon affected tracts), loss of bladder and bowel control (usually with urinary retention and bladder distention), loss of sweating and vasomotor tone, and marked reduction of blood pressure from loss of peripheral vascular resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">If conscious, the patient usually complains of acute pain in the back or neck, which may radiate along the involved nerve. However, absence of pain does not rule out spinal injury, and a careful assessment of the spine should be conducted if there has been a significant force and mechanism of injury (i.e., concomitant head injury).</p>
<p class="indent">Respiratory dysfunction is related to the level of injury. The muscles contributing to respiration are the diaphragm (C4), intercostals (T1&#x2013;T6), and abdominals (T6&#x2013;T12). Injuries at C4 or above (causing paralysis of the diaphragm) often will require ventilator support, since acute respiratory failure is a leading cause of death (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Injuries of T12 and above will have impact on respiratory function. Functional abilities by level of injury are described in Table&#x00A0;63-3.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3011">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A detailed neurologic examination is performed. Diagnostic x-rays (lateral cervical spine x-rays) and CT scanning are usually performed initially. An MRI scan may be ordered as a further workup if a ligamentous injury is suspected, because significant spinal cord damage may exist even in the absence of bony injury (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). If an MRI scan is contraindicated, a myelogram may be used to visualize the spinal axis. An assessment is made for other injuries because spinal trauma often is accompanied by concomitant injuries, commonly to the head and chest. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring may be indicated if an SCI is suspected, because bradycardia (slow heart rate) and asystole (cardiac standstill) are common in patients with acute spinal cord injuries.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3012">Emergency Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The immediate management at the scene of the injury is critical because improper handling of the patient can cause further damage and loss of neurologic function. Any patient who is involved in a motor vehicle crash, a diving or contact sports injury, a fall, or any direct trauma to the head and neck must be considered to have SCI until such an injury is ruled out. Initial care must include a rapid assessment, immobilization, extrication, and stabilization or control of life-threatening injuries, and transportation to the most appropriate medical facility. Immediate transportation to a trauma center with the capacity to manage major neurologic trauma is then necessary (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">At the scene of the injury, the patient must be immobilized on a spinal (back) board, with the head and neck maintained in a neutral position, to prevent an incomplete injury from becoming complete. One member of the team must assume control of the patient&#x2019;s head to prevent flexion, rotation, or extension; this is done by placing the hands on both sides of the patient&#x2019;s head at about ear level to limit movement and maintain alignment while a spinal board and cervical immobilizing device is applied. If possible, at least four people should slide the patient carefully onto a board for transfer to the hospital. Head blocks should also be considered, as they will further limit any neck movement. Any twisting movement may irreversibly damage the spinal cord by causing bony fragment or disc movement or exacerbating ligamentous injury, causing further instability.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is referred to a regional spinal injury or trauma center because of the multidisciplinary personnel and support services required to counteract the destructive changes that occur in the first 24 hours after injury. During treatment in the emergency and x-ray departments, the patient is kept on the transfer board. The patient must always be maintained in an extended position. No part of the body should be twisted or turned, and the patient is not allowed to sit up. Once the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2074" title="2074"></span>extent of the injury has been determined, the patient may be placed on a rotating specialty bed or in a cervical collar (see <a href="#ff63-5">Fig. 63-5</a>). Later, if SCI and bone instability have been ruled out, the patient may be moved to a conventional bed or the collar may be removed without harm. If a specialty bed is needed but not available, the patient should be placed in a cervical collar and on a firm mattress.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3013"><img class="m" src="images/icon17a.png" alt=""/> Medical Management (Acute Phase)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of management are to prevent secondary injury, to observe for symptoms of progressive neurologic deficits, and to prevent complications. The patient is resuscitated as necessary, and oxygenation and cardiovascular stability are maintained. SCI is a devastating event; new treatment methods and medications are continually being investigated for the acute and chronic phases of care (<a href="#bib4447">Venkatesh et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Administration of high-dose IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) in the first 24 or 48 hours is controversial. The validity of studies has been questioned based on critical analysis of the original and additional data. As a result, there is now a consensus that corticosteroids may offer only a slight benefit. Corticosteroids are no longer considered the standard of care for acute SCI, although some centers continue to use corticosteroid protocols (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Respiratory Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen is given to maintain a high partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>), because hypoxemia can create or worsen a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2075" title="2075"></span>neurologic deficit of the spinal cord. If endotracheal intubation is necessary, extreme care is taken to avoid flexing or extending the patient&#x2019;s neck, which can result in extension of a cervical injury.</p>
<p class="indent">In high cervical spine injuries, spinal cord innervation to the phrenic nerve, which stimulates the diaphragm, is lost. Diaphragmatic pacing (electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve) attempts to stimulate the diaphragm to help the patient breathe. Intramuscular diaphragmatic pacing is currently in the clinical trial phase for the patient with a high cervical injury. This is implanted via laparoscopic surgery, usually after the acute phase.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Skeletal Fracture Reduction and Traction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Management of SCI requires immobilization and reduction of dislocations (restoration of preinjury position) and stabilization of the vertebral column. This can be accomplished by surgical or nonsurgical interventions; both aim to prevent new or worsening neurologic damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Cervical fractures can be reduced, and the cervical spine aligned with some form of skeletal traction, such as with skeletal tongs or with the use of the halo device. Traction is applied to the skeletal traction device by weights (ensuring the weights are unencumbered); the amount depends on the size of the patient and the degree of fracture displacement. The traction force is exerted along the longitudinal axis of the vertebral bodies, with the patient&#x2019;s neck in a neutral position. The traction is then gradually increased by adding more weights. As the amount of traction is increased, the spaces between the intervertebral discs widen and the vertebrae are given a chance to slip back into position. Reduction usually occurs after correct alignment has been restored. Once reduction is achieved, as verified by cervical spine x-rays and neurologic examination, the weights are gradually removed until the amount of weight needed to maintain the alignment is identified. Traction is sometimes supplemented with manual manipulation of the neck by a surgeon, to help achieve realignment of the vertebral bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">A halo device may be used initially with traction or may be applied after removal of the tongs. It consists of a titanium or stainless-steel halo ring that is fixed to the skull by four pins, which are inserted into the outer table of the skull. The ring is attached to a removable halo vest, a device that suspends the weight of the unit circumferentially around the chest. A frame connects the ring to the chest. Halo devices provide immobilization of the cervical spine while allowing early ambulation (see <a href="#ff63-6">Fig. 63-6</a>) for patients with adequate function.</p>
<p class="indent">Thoracic and lumbar injuries are usually treated with surgical intervention, followed by immobilization with a fitted brace. Traction is often not indicated either before or after surgery, due to the relative stability of the spine in these regions.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is indicated in any of the following situations:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Compression of the cord is evident.</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>The injury results in a fragmented or unstable vertebral body.</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>The injury involves a wound that penetrates the cord.</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Bony fragments are in the spinal canal.</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>The patient&#x2019;s neurologic status is deteriorating.</p>
<p class="indent">Early surgical stabilization may improve the clinical outcome of patients compared to surgery performed later during the clinical course. The goals of surgical treatment are to preserve neurologic function by removing pressure from the spinal cord and to provide stability.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3014">Management of Acute Complications of Spinal Cord Injury</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Spinal and Neurogenic Shock</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The spinal shock associated with SCI reflects a sudden depression of reflex activity in the spinal cord, called areflexia, that occurs below the level of injury. The muscles innervated by the part of the spinal cord segment below the level of the lesion are without sensation, paralyzed, and flaccid, and the reflexes are absent. Blood pressure may be decreased, and the patient may be bradycardic. Hypotension and shock can further damage the spinal cord; therefore, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2076" title="2076"></span>85 mm Hg or higher during the hyperacute phase. The reflexes that initiate bladder and bowel function are affected. Bowel distention and paralytic ileus can be caused by depression of the reflexes and are treated with intestinal decompression by insertion of a nasogastric tube. A paralytic ileus most often occurs within the first 2 to 3 days after SCI and resolves within 3 to 7 days.</p>
<p class="indent">Neurogenic shock develops as a result of the loss of autonomic nervous system function below the level of the lesion. The vital organs are affected, causing decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, as well as venous pooling in the extremities and peripheral vasodilation (<a href="#bib4447">Volski &#x0026; Ackerman, 2020</a>). In addition, the patient does not perspire in the paralyzed portions of the body, because sympathetic activity is blocked; therefore, close observation is required for early detection of an abrupt onset of fever. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for further discussion on neurogenic shock.</p>
<p class="indent">With injuries to the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord, innervation to the major accessory muscles of respiration is lost and respiratory problems develop. These include decreased vital capacity, retention of secretions, increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels and decreased oxygen levels, respiratory failure, and pulmonary edema.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Venous Thromboembolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potential complication of immobility and occurs in patients with SCI at the same rate as those having had other types of traumatic injuries (<a href="#bib4390">Wang, Strayer, Harris, et al., 2017</a>). Patients who develop VTE are at high risk for both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE due to immobility, flaccidity, and decreased vasomotor tone (<a href="#bib4447">Wang et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Manifestations of PE include pleuritic chest pain, anxiety, shortness of breath, and abnormal blood gas values (increased PaCO<sub>2</sub> and decreased PaO<sub>2</sub>). A fatal PE has been reported in up to 2% of patients with SCI within the first 3 months after injury (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Low-dose anticoagulation therapy usually is initiated to prevent DVT and PE, along with the use of anti-embolism stockings or sequential pneumatic compression devices (SCDs). In some cases, permanent indwelling filters may be placed prophylactically in the vena cava to prevent emboli (dislodged clots) from migrating to the lungs and causing PE. Prevention continues into the rehabilitation and chronic phases of SCI care (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). See <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion on VTE.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient&#x2019;s breathing pattern and the strength of the cough are assessed, and the lungs are auscultated, because paralysis of the diaphragm, in addition to abdominal and respiratory muscles, diminishes coughing and makes clearing of bronchial and pharyngeal secretions difficult. Reduced excursion of the chest also results.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is monitored closely for any changes in motor or sensory function and for symptoms of progressive neurologic damage. In the early stages of SCI, determining whether the cord has been severed may not be possible, because signs and symptoms of cord edema are indistinguishable from those of cord transection. Edema of the spinal cord may occur with any severe cord injury and may further compromise spinal cord function.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Motor and sensory functions are assessed through careful neurologic examination. These findings are recorded on a flow sheet so that changes in the baseline neurologic status can be monitored closely and accurately. The ASIA classification is commonly used to describe the level of function for patients with SCI (see <a href="#ff63-4">Fig. 63-4</a>). <a href="#ct63-7">Chart 63-7</a> also gives examples of the effects of altered spinal cord function. At the minimum:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Motor ability is tested by asking the patient to spread the fingers, squeeze the examiner&#x2019;s hand, and move the toes or turn the feet.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sensation is evaluated by gently pinching the skin or touching it lightly with an object such as a tongue blade, starting at shoulder level and working down both sides of the extremities. The patient should have both eyes closed so that the examination reveals true findings, not what the patient hopes to feel. The patient is asked where the sensation is felt.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Any decrease in neurologic function is reported immediately.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is also assessed for spinal shock, which is a complete loss of all reflex, motor, sensory, and autonomic activity below the level of the lesion that causes bladder paralysis and distention. The lower abdomen is palpated for signs of urinary retention and overdistention of the bladder. Further assessment is made for gastric dilation and paralytic ileus caused by an atonic bowel, a result of autonomic disruption.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Temperature is monitored because the patient may have periods of hyperthermia as a result of altered temperature control, which is due to the inability to perspire related to autonomic disruption. Body temperature becomes dependent on surroundings (poikilothermia).</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>VTE</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Orthostatic hypotension</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient may include improved breathing pattern and airway clearance, improved mobility, prevention of injury due to sensory impairment, maintenance of skin integrity, relief of urinary retention, improved bowel function, decreasing pain, early recognition of autonomic dysreflexia, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> A<span class="small">DEQUATE</span> B<span class="small">REATHING AND</span> A<span class="small">IRWAY</span> C<span class="small">LEARANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Possible impending respiratory failure is detected by observing the patient, measuring vital capacity, monitoring oxygen saturation through pulse oximetry, and monitoring arterial blood gases. Early and vigorous attention to clearing bronchial and pharyngeal secretions can prevent retention of secretions and atelectasis. Suctioning may be indicated but should be used with caution to avoid stimulating the vagus nerve and producing bradycardia and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient cannot cough effectively because of decreased inspiratory volume and inability to generate sufficient expiratory pressure, chest physiotherapy and assisted coughing may be indicated. Specific breathing exercises are supervised by the nurse to increase the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm. Assisted coughing promotes clearing of secretions from the upper respiratory tract and is similar to the use of abdominal thrusts to clear an airway. Assisted coughing can be more effective than traditional suctioning because traditional suctioning clears the right mainstem bronchus, whereas sites for atelectasis and pneumonia are most commonly in the left lower lung lobe (<a href="#bib4447">Wang et al., 2017</a>). Proper humidification and hydration are important to prevent secretions from becoming thick and difficult to remove even with coughing. The patient is assessed for signs of respiratory infection (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea). Ascending edema of the spinal cord in the acute phase may cause respiratory difficulty that requires immediate intervention. Therefore, the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status must be monitored closely.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> M<span class="small">OBILITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Proper body alignment is maintained at all times. If not on a specialized rotating bed, the patient should not be turned until the primary provider has indicated that it is safe to do so. Once safe for movement, the patient is repositioned frequently and is assisted out of bed as soon as the spinal column is stabilized. Various types of splints are used to prevent footdrop, which can often occur. When used, the splints are removed and reapplied every 2 hours. Trochanter rolls, applied from the crest of the ilium to the midthigh of both legs, help prevent external rotation of the hip joints. Patients with lesions above the midthoracic level have loss of sympathetic control of peripheral vasoconstrictor activity, leading to hypotension. These patients may tolerate changes in position poorly and require monitoring of blood pressure when positions are changed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Contractures can develop rapidly with immobility and muscle paralysis. A joint that is immobilized too long becomes fixed as a result of contractures of the tendon and joint capsule. Atrophy of the extremities results from disuse. Contractures and other complications may be prevented by range-of-motion exercises that help preserve joint motion and stimulate circulation. Passive range-of-motion exercises should be implemented as soon as possible after the injury. Toes, metatarsals, ankles, knees, and hips should be put through a full range of motion at least four, or ideally five, times daily.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For most patients who have a cervical fracture without neurologic deficit, reduction in traction followed by rigid immobilization for 6 to 8 weeks restores skeletal integrity. These patients are allowed to move gradually to an erect position. A neck brace or molded collar is applied when the patient is mobilized after traction is removed (see <a href="#ff63-5">Fig. 63-5</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> I<span class="small">NJURY DUE TO</span> S<span class="small">ENSORY AND</span> P<span class="small">ERCEPTUAL</span> A<span class="small">LTERATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse assists the patient to compensate for sensory and perceptual alterations that occur with SCI. The intact senses above the level of the injury are stimulated through touch, aromas, flavorful food and beverages, conversation, and music. Additional strategies include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Providing glasses to enable the patient to see from the supine position</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encouraging the use of hearing aids, if indicated, to enable the patient to hear conversations and environmental sounds</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Providing emotional support to the patient and family</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Educating the patient and family about strategies to compensate for, or cope with, sensory deficits</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">AINTAINING</span> S<span class="small">KIN</span> I<span class="small">NTEGRITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Pressure injuries are a significant complication of SCI. They may begin within hours of an acute SCI where pressure is continuous and where the peripheral circulation is inadequate as a result of spinal shock and a recumbent position. It is important to move the patient from the backboard as soon as possible and inspect the skin. In addition, patients who wear cervical collars for prolonged periods may develop breakdown from the pressure of the collar under the chin, on the shoulders, and at the occiput. Pressure injury can add substantially to the personal and economic costs of living with SCI.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2077</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2078" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2078">p. 2078</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The most effective approach to addressing this costly complication of SCI is prevention. The patient&#x2019;s position is changed at least every 2 hours. Turning not only assists in the prevention of pressure injuries but also prevents pooling of blood and edema in the dependent areas. Careful inspection of the skin is made each time the patient is turned. The skin over the pressure points is assessed for redness or breaks; the perineum is checked for soilage, and the catheter is observed for adequate drainage. The patient&#x2019;s general body alignment and comfort are assessed. Special attention should be given to pressure areas in contact with the transfer board.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, the patient&#x2019;s skin should be kept clean by washing with a mild soap, rinsing well, and blotting dry. Pressure-sensitive areas should be kept well lubricated and soft with oil or emollient lotion. The patient is educated about the danger of pressure injuries and is encouraged to take control and make decisions about appropriate skin care. See <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a> for other aspects of care and prevention of pressure injuries.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">AINTAINING</span> U<span class="small">RINARY</span> E<span class="small">LIMINATION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Immediately after SCI, the urinary bladder becomes atonic and cannot contract by reflex activity. Urinary retention is the immediate result. During the initial acute phase, a urinary catheter is inserted; however, prompt discontinuation is advised due to high risk for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Once discontinued, the patient has no sensation of bladder distention and overstretching of the bladder and detrusor muscle may occur, delaying the return of bladder function.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Intermittent catheterization is carried out to avoid overdistention of the bladder and high risk for UTI due to retention of urine. At an early stage, family members are shown how to carry out intermittent catheterization and are encouraged to participate in this facet of care, because they will be involved in long-term follow-up and must be able to recognize complications so that treatment can be instituted.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is educated to record fluid intake, voiding pattern, amounts of residual urine after voiding, characteristics of urine, and any unusual sensations that may occur. The management of a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neurogenic bladder:&lt;/b&gt; bladder dysfunction that results from a disorder or dysfunction of the nervous system and leads to urinary incontinence">neurogenic bladder</button></strong> (bladder dysfunction that results from a disorder or dysfunction of the nervous system) is addressed during the rehabilitation phase of care. The types of neurogenic bladder differ according to which motor or sensory pathways are disrupted (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">External catheters (condom catheters) and leg bags to collect spontaneous voidings are useful for male patients with reflex or total incontinence. The appropriate design and size must be chosen for maximal success, and the patient or caregiver must be taught how to apply the condom catheter and how to provide daily hygiene including skin inspection. Instruction on emptying the leg bag must also be provided, and modifications can be made for patients with limited hand dexterity.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> B<span class="small">OWEL</span> F<span class="small">UNCTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Immediately after SCI, a paralytic ileus usually develops as a result of neurogenic paralysis of the bowel; therefore, a nasogastric tube is often required to relieve distention and to prevent vomiting and aspiration (<a href="#bib4426">Stoffel, Van der Aa, Wittmann, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Bowel activity usually returns within the first week. With the intake of nutrition, it is important to establish a bowel program. A bowel program can help to control bowel movements by establishing a pattern of planned evacuation. The nurse administers prescribed combinations of stool softeners, stimulant laxatives, bulking laxatives, and rectal laxatives along with rectal stimulation, to counteract the effects of immobility and analgesic agents (<a href="#bib4447">Stoffel et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">A patient who has had pins, tongs, or calipers placed for cervical stabilization may have a headache or discomfort for several days after the pins are inserted. Patients initially may be bothered by the rather startling appearance of these devices, but usually they readily adapt to it because the device provides comfort for the unstable neck (see <a href="#ff63-6">Fig. 63-6</a>). The patient may complain of being caged in and of noise created by any object coming in contact with the frame of a halo device, but they can be reassured that adaptation will occur.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The areas around the four pin sites of a halo device are cleaned at least daily and observed for redness, drainage, and pain. The pins are observed for loosening, which may contribute to infection. If one of the pins becomes detached, the head is stabilized in a neutral position by one person, while another notifies the primary provider. A torque screwdriver should be readily available in case the screws on the frame need tightening.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The skin under the halo vest is inspected for excessive perspiration, redness, and skin blistering, especially on the bony prominences. The vest is opened at the sides to allow the torso to be washed. The liner of the vest should not become wet, because dampness causes skin excoriation. Powder is not used inside the vest, because it may contribute to the development of pressure injuries. The liner should be changed periodically to promote hygiene and good skin care. If the patient is to be discharged with the vest, detailed instructions must be given to the family, with time allowed for them to demonstrate the necessary skills of halo vest care (see <a href="#ct63-8">Chart 63-8</a>).</p>

It occurs only after spinal shock has resolved. This syndrome is characterized by a severe, pounding headache with paroxysmal hypertension, profuse diaphoresis above the spinal level of the lesion (most often of the forehead), nausea, nasal congestion, and bradycardia. It occurs among patients with cord lesions above T6 (the sympathetic visceral outflow level) after spinal shock has subsided. The sudden increase in blood pressure may cause retinal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or seizures (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A number of stimuli may trigger this reflex: distended bladder (the most common cause); distention or contraction of the visceral organs, especially the bowel (from constipation, impaction); or stimulation of the skin (tactile, pain, thermal stimuli, pressure injury). Because this is an emergency situation, the objectives are to remove the triggering stimulus and to avoid the possibility of serious complications (<a href="#bib4447">Eldahan &#x0026; Rabchevsky, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients are at high risk for VTE after SCI. The patient must be assessed for symptoms of VTE including DVT and PE. Chest pain, shortness of breath, and changes in arterial blood gas values must be reported promptly to the primary provider. The circumferences of the thighs and calves are measured and recorded daily; further diagnostic studies are performed if a significant increase is noted. Patients remain at high risk for thrombophlebitis for several months after the initial injury. Patients with paraplegia or tetraplegia are at increased risk for the rest of their lives. Immobilization and the associated venous stasis, as well as varying degrees of autonomic disruption, contribute to the high risk and susceptibility for DVT.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Anticoagulation should be initiated within 72 hours of injury and continued for at least 3 months (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). The use of low-molecular-weight heparin or low-dose unfractionated heparin may be followed by long-term oral anticoagulation (i.e., warfarin). Additional measures such as range-of-motion exercises, anti-embolism stockings, and adequate hydration are important preventive measures. SCDs may also be used to reduce venous pooling and promote venous return. It is also important to avoid external pressure on the lower extremities that may result from flexion of the knees while the patient is in bed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Orthostatic Hypotension.</span> For the first 2 weeks after SCI, the blood pressure tends to be unstable and can be quite low. It gradually returns to preinjury levels, but periodic episodes of severe orthostatic hypotension frequently interfere with efforts to mobilize the patient. Interruption in the reflex arcs that normally produce vasoconstriction in the upright position, coupled with vasodilation and pooling in abdominal and lower extremity vessels, can result in hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension is a particularly common problem for patients with lesions above T7. In some patients with tetraplegia, even slight elevations of the head can result in blood pressure dysregulation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A number of techniques can be used to reduce the frequency of hypotensive episodes. Close monitoring of vital signs before and during position changes is essential. Optimization of fluid status and vasopressor medication can be used to treat the profound vasodilation. Anti-embolism stockings should be applied to improve venous return from the lower extremities. Abdominal binders may also be used to encourage venous return and provide diaphragmatic support when the patient is upright (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). Activity should be planned in advance, and adequate time should be allowed for a slow progression of position changes from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2080" title="2080"></span>recumbent to sitting and upright. Tilt tables frequently are helpful in assisting patients to make this transition.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> In most cases, patients with SCI (i.e., patients with tetraplegia or paraplegia) need long-term rehabilitation. The process begins during hospitalization as acute symptoms begin to subside or come under better control and the overall deficits and long-term effects of the injury become clear. The goals begin to shift from merely surviving the injury to learning strategies necessary to cope with the alterations that the injury imposes on activities of daily living (ADLs). The emphasis shifts from ensuring that the patient is stable and free of complications to specific assessment and planning designed to meet the patient&#x2019;s rehabilitation needs. Patient education may initially focus on the injury and its effects on mobility; dressing; and bowel, bladder, and sexual function. As the patient and family acknowledge the consequences of the injury and the resulting disability, the focus of education broadens to address issues necessary for carrying out the tasks of daily living and taking charge of their lives. Education must begin in the acute phase and continue throughout rehabilitation and the patient&#x2019;s entire life as changes occur, the patient ages, and problems arise.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Caring for the patient with SCI at home may at first seem a daunting task to the family. They will require dedicated nursing support to gradually assume full care of the patient. Although maintaining function and preventing complications will remain important, goals regarding self-care and preparation for discharge will assist in a smooth transition to rehabilitation and eventually to the community.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The goal of the rehabilitation process is independence. The nurse becomes a support to both the patient and the family, assisting them to assume responsibility for increasing aspects of patient care and management. Care for the patient with SCI involves members of all health care disciplines, which may include nursing, medicine, rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, physical and occupational therapy, case management, and social services. The nurse often serves as a coordinator of the management team and as a liaison with rehabilitation centers and home care agencies.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">There are many challenges in providing care to the patient with SCI; meeting their psychological needs can be particularly challenging (<a href="#bib4395">Bibi, Rasmussen, &#x0026; McLiesh, 2018</a>). The patient and family often require assistance in dealing with the psychological impact of the injury and its consequences; referral to a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist or other mental health care professional often is helpful. Therapeutic horseback riding may help increase balance, muscle strength, and self-esteem (<a href="#bib4425">Stergiou, Tzoufi, Ntzani, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse should reassure female patients with SCI that pregnancy is not contraindicated and fertility is relatively unaffected, but that pregnant women with acute or chronic SCI pose unique management challenges. The normal physiologic changes of pregnancy may predispose women with SCI to many potentially life-threatening complications, including autonomic dysreflexia, pyelonephritis, respiratory insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, PE, and unattended delivery. Preconception assessment and counseling are strongly recommended to ensure that the woman is in optimal health and to increase the likelihood of an uneventful pregnancy and healthy outcomes (<a href="#bib4399">Crane, Doody, Schiff, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">As more patients survive acute SCI, they face the changes associated with aging with a disability. Three common secondary health problems experienced by persons living with SCI include chronic pain, spasticity, and depression (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). Education in the home and community focuses on health promotion and addresses the need to minimize risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, substance use disorder, obesity). Routine health-screening and preventive services are needed for the older adult with SCI for early detection of secondary health problems. Home health nurses and others who have contact with patients with SCI are in a position to educate patients about healthy lifestyles, remind them of the need for health screenings, and make referrals as appropriate. Assisting patients to identify accessible health care providers, clinical facilities, and imaging centers may increase the likelihood that they will participate in health screening.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3015">Medical Management of Long-Term Complications of SCI</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient faces a lifetime disability, requiring ongoing follow-up and care. The expertise of a number of health professionals including physicians (specifically a physiatrist), rehabilitation nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, rehabilitation engineers, and vocational counselors, is necessary at different times as the need arises.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with an SCI has a shorter life expectancy compared to those who have not had an SCI (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). As patients with SCI age, they have many of the same medical problems as others. In addition, they face the threat of complications associated with their disability (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Usually, patients are encouraged to follow-up at an outpatient spinal cord clinic when complications and other issues arise. Lifetime care includes assessment of the urinary tract at prescribed intervals because there is the likelihood of continuing alteration in detrusor and sphincter function, and the patient is prone to UTI (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Long-term problems and complications of SCI include disuse syndrome, autonomic dysreflexia (discussed earlier), bladder and kidney infections, spasticity, and depression (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). Pressure injuries with potential complications of sepsis, osteomyelitis, and fistulas occur in about 10% of patients. Spasticity may be particularly disabling. Heterotopic ossification (overgrowth of bone) in the hips, knees, shoulders, and elbows occurs in many patients after SCI. Spasticity and heterotopic ossification are painful and can produce a loss of range of motion (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). Management includes observing for and addressing any alteration in physiologic status and psychological outlook, as well as the prevention and treatment of long-term complications. The nursing role involves emphasizing the need for vigilance in self-assessment and care.</p>

<p class="processppara">Assessment focuses on the patient&#x2019;s general condition, complications, and how the patient is managing at that particular point in time. A head-to-toe assessment and review of systems should be part of the database, with emphasis on the areas that are prone to problems in this population. A thorough inspection of all areas of the skin for redness or breakdown is critical. The nurse reviews the established bowel and bladder program with the patient, because the program must continue uninterrupted. Patients with tetraplegia or paraplegia have varying degrees of loss of motor power, deep and superficial sensation, vasomotor control, bladder and bowel control, and sexual function. They are faced with potential complications related to immobility, skin breakdown and pressure injuries, recurring UTIs, and contractures. Knowledge about these particular issues can further guide the assessment in any setting. Nurses in all settings, including home care, must be aware of these potential complications in the lifetime management of these patients.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">An understanding of the emotional and psychological responses to tetraplegia or paraplegia is achieved by observing the responses and behaviors of the patient and family and by listening to their concerns (<a href="#bib4393">Bailey, Gammage, van Ingen, et al., 2017</a>). Documenting these assessments and reviewing the plan with the entire team on a regular basis provide insight into how both the patient and the family are coping with the changes in lifestyle and body functioning. Additional information frequently can be gathered from the social worker or psychiatric/mental health worker.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">It takes time for the patient and family to comprehend the magnitude of the disability. They may go through stages of grief, including shock, disbelief, denial, anger, depression, and acceptance. During the acute phase of the injury, denial can be a protective mechanism to shield the patient from the acute reality of what has happened. As the patient realizes the permanent nature of paraplegia or tetraplegia, the grieving process may be prolonged and all-encompassing because of the recognition that long-held plans and expectations are interrupted or permanently altered. A period of depression often follows as the patient experiences a loss of self-esteem in areas of self-identity, sexual functioning, and social and emotional roles. Exploration and assessment of these issues can assist in developing a meaningful plan of care.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient may include attainment of some form of mobility; maintenance of healthy, intact skin; achievement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2082" title="2082"></span>of bladder management without infection; achievement of bowel control; achievement of sexual expression; strengthening of coping mechanisms; knowledge of long-term management; and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient requires extensive rehabilitation, which is less difficult if appropriate nursing management has been carried out during the acute phase of the injury or illness. Nursing care is one of the key factors determining the success of the rehabilitation program. The main objective is for the patient to live as independently as possible in the home and community.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">NCREASING</span> M<span class="small">OBILITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Exercise Programs.</span> The unaffected parts of the body are built up to optimal strength to promote maximum self-care. The muscles of the hands, arms, shoulders, chest, spine, abdomen, and neck must be strengthened in the patient with paraplegia, because they must bear full weight on these muscles to ambulate. The triceps and the latissimus dorsi are important muscles used in crutch walking. The muscles of the abdomen and the back also are necessary for balance and for maintaining the upright position.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">To strengthen these muscles, the patient can do push-ups when in a prone position and sit-ups when in a sitting position. Extending the arms while holding weights (traction weights can be used) also develops muscle strength. Squeezing rubber balls or crumbling newspaper promotes hand strength.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">With encouragement from all members of the rehabilitation team, the patient with paraplegia can develop the increased exercise tolerance needed for gait training and ambulation activities. The importance of maintaining cardiovascular fitness is stressed to the patient. Alternative exercises to increase the heart rate to target levels must be designed within the patient&#x2019;s abilities.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Mobilization.</span> After the spine is stable enough to allow the patient to assume an upright posture, mobilization activities are initiated. A brace or vest may be used, depending on the level of the lesion. The sooner muscles are used, the less chance there is of disuse atrophy. The earlier the patient is brought to a standing position, the less opportunity there is for osteoporotic changes to take place in the long bones. Weight bearing also reduces the possibility of renal calculi and enhances many other metabolic processes.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Braces and crutches enable some patients with paraplegia to ambulate for short distances. Ambulation using crutches requires a high expenditure of energy. Motorized wheelchairs and specially equipped vans can provide greater independence and mobility for patients with high-level SCI or other lesions. Every effort should be made to encourage the patient to be as mobile and active as possible.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtc2.png" alt=""/> Long-term risks include altered body composition, a decrease in lean body mass, decreased bone mineral density, and increased body mass index (BMI). Patients are at high risk for obesity due to high fat intake combined with decreased physical activity (<a href="#bib4423">Silveira, Winter, Clark, et al., 2019</a>). This puts patients at higher risk for developing comorbid conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Patients benefit from nutrition counseling to prevent these secondary complications. For those who are overweight or who have obesity, weight-loss programs must be designed to accommodate the dietary and physical activity barriers that are unique to this population.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> D<span class="small">ISUSE</span> S<span class="small">YNDROME</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients are at high risk for development of contractures as a result of disuse syndrome due to the musculoskeletal system changes (atrophy) brought about by the loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of injury. Range-of-motion exercises must be provided at least four times a day, and care is taken to stretch the Achilles tendon with exercises, to prevent footdrop. The patient is repositioned frequently and is maintained in proper body alignment whether in bed or in a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Contractures can complicate day-to-day care, increasing the difficulty of positioning and decreasing mobility. A number of surgical procedures have been tried, with varying degrees of success. These techniques are used if more conservative approaches fail, but the best treatment is prevention.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> S<span class="small">KIN</span> I<span class="small">NTEGRITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because these patients spend a great portion of their lives in wheelchairs, pressure injuries are an ever-present threat. Contributing factors are permanent sensory loss over pressure areas; immobility, which makes relief of pressure difficult; trauma from bumps (against the wheelchair, toilet, furniture, and so forth) that cause unnoticed abrasions and wounds; loss of protective function of the skin from excoriation and maceration due to excessive perspiration and possible incontinence; and poor general health (anemia, diabetes), leading to poor tissue perfusion. See <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a> for discussion on the prevention and management of pressure injuries.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The person with tetraplegia or paraplegia must take responsibility for monitoring (or directing monitoring) of their skin status. This involves relieving pressure and not remaining in any position for longer than 2 hours, in addition to ensuring that the skin receives meticulous attention and cleansing. The patient is educated that pressure injuries develop over bony prominences that are exposed to unrelieved pressure in the sitting and lying positions. The most vulnerable areas are identified. The patient with paraplegia is instructed to use mirrors, if possible, to inspect these areas morning and night, observing for redness, slight edema, or any abrasions. While in bed, the patient should turn at 2-hour intervals and then inspect the skin again for redness that does not fade on pressure. The bottom sheet should be checked for wetness and for creases. The patient with tetraplegia or paraplegia, who cannot perform these activities, is encouraged to direct others to check these areas and prevent pressure injuries from developing.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is educated to relieve pressure while in the wheelchair by doing push-ups, leaning from side to side to relieve ischial pressure, and tilting forward while leaning on a table. The caregiver for the patient with tetraplegia will need to perform these activities if the patient cannot do so independently. A wheelchair cushion is prescribed to meet individual needs, which may change in time with changes in posture, weight, and skin tolerance. A referral can be made to a rehabilitation engineer, who can measure pressure levels while the patient is sitting and then tailor the cushion and other necessary aids and assistive devices to the patient&#x2019;s needs.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2082</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2083" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2083">p. 2083</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The diet for the patient with tetraplegia or paraplegia should be high in protein, vitamins, and calories to ensure minimal wasting of muscle and the maintenance of healthy skin, and high in fluids to maintain well-functioning kidneys. Excessive weight gain and obesity should be avoided because they further limit mobility.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> B<span class="small">LADDER</span> M<span class="small">ANAGEMENT</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The effect of the spinal cord lesion on the bladder depends on the level of injury, the degree of cord damage, and the length of time after injury. A patient with tetraplegia or paraplegia usually has either a reflex or a nonreflex bladder. Both bladder types increase the risk for UTI.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse emphasizes the importance of maintaining an adequate flow of urine by encouraging a fluid intake of about 2.5 L daily. The patient should empty the bladder frequently so that there is minimal residual urine and should pay attention to personal hygiene, because infection of the bladder and kidneys almost always occurs by the ascending route. The perineum must be kept clean and dry, and attention must be given to the perianal skin after defecation. Underwear should be cotton (which is more absorbent) and should be changed at least once a day.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If an external catheter (condom catheter) is used, the sheath is removed nightly; the penis is cleansed to remove urine and is dried carefully, because warm urine on the periurethral skin promotes the growth of bacteria. Attention also is given to the collection bag. The nurse emphasizes the importance of monitoring for signs of UTI: cloudy, foul-smelling urine or hematuria (blood in the urine); fever; or chills.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The female patient who cannot achieve reflex bladder control or self-catheterization may need to wear pads or waterproof undergarments. Surgical intervention may be indicated in some patients to create a urinary diversion.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<span class="small">STABLISHING</span> B<span class="small">OWEL</span> C<span class="small">ONTROL</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The objective of a bowel training program is to establish bowel evacuation through reflex conditioning. If the SCI occurs above the sacral segments or nerve roots and there is reflex activity, the anal sphincter may be massaged (digital stimulation) to stimulate defecation. If the cord lesion involves the sacral segment or nerve roots, anal massage is not performed because the anus may be relaxed and lack tone. Massage is also contraindicated if there is spasticity of the anal sphincter. The anal sphincter is massaged by inserting a gloved finger (which has been adequately lubricated) 2.5 to 3.7 cm (1 to 1.5 inches) into the rectum and moving it in a circular motion or from side to side. It soon becomes apparent which area triggers the defecation response. This procedure should be performed at regular time intervals (usually every 48 hours), after a meal, and at a time that will be convenient for the patient at home (<a href="#bib4421">Schmelzer, Daniels, &#x0026; Baird, 2018</a>). The patient is educated about the symptoms of impaction (frequent loose stools; constipation) and is cautioned to watch for hemorrhoids. A diet with sufficient fluids and fiber is essential to developing a successful bowel training program, avoiding constipation, and decreasing the risk for autonomic dysreflexia.</p>

<p class="processppara">Many patients with tetraplegia and paraplegia can have some form of meaningful sexual relationship, although modifications are necessary. The patient and partner benefit from counseling about the range of sexual expression possible, special techniques and positions, exploration of body sensations offering sensual feelings, and urinary and bowel hygiene as related to sexual activity. For men with erectile failure, penile prostheses enable them to have and sustain an erection, and medications for erectile dysfunction may be helpful. Sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil, for example, are oral smooth muscle relaxants that cause blood to flow into the penis, resulting in an erection (see <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a>). Patients who are sexually active should undergo counseling in birth control methods, as some methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) may increase risks for complications such as VTE (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Sexual education and counseling services are included in the rehabilitation services at spinal centers. Small group meetings in which patients can share their feelings, receive information, and discuss sexual concerns and practical aspects are helpful in producing effective attitudes and adjustments.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<span class="small">NHANCING</span> C<span class="small">OPING</span> M<span class="small">ECHANISMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The impact of the disability and loss becomes marked when the patient returns home. Each time something new enters the patient&#x2019;s life (e.g., a new relationship, going to work), the patient is reminded anew of their limitations. Grief reactions and depression are common.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">To work through depression, the patient must have some hope for relief in the future. The nurse can encourage the patient to feel confident in their ability to achieve self-care and relative independence. The role of the nurse ranges from caretaker during the acute phase to educator, counselor, and facilitator as the patient gains mobility and independence.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s disability affects not only the patient but also the entire family. In many cases, family therapy is helpful in working through issues as they arise. Adjustment to the disability leads to the development of realistic goals for the future, making the best of the abilities that are left intact, and reinvesting in other activities and relationships. Rejection of the disability causes self-destructive neglect and nonadherence to the therapeutic program, which leads to more frustration and depression. Crises for which interventions may be sought include social, psychological, marital, sexual, and psychiatric problems. The family usually requires counseling, social services, and other support systems to help them cope with the changes in their lifestyle and socioeconomic status.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A major goal of nursing management is to help the patient overcome their sense of futility and to encourage the patient in the emotional adjustment that must be made before they are willing to venture into the outside world. However, an excessively sympathetic attitude on the part of the nurse may cause the patient to develop an overdependence that defeats the purpose of the entire rehabilitation program. The patient is educated and assisted when necessary, but the nurse should avoid performing activities that the patient can do independently with a little effort. This approach to care more than repays itself in the satisfaction of seeing a patient, who is completely demoralized and helpless, become independent and find meaning in a newly emerging lifestyle.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ONITORING AND</span> M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> P<span class="small">OTENTIAL</span> C<span class="small">OMPLICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Spasticity.</span> Muscle spasticity can be a problematic complication of tetraplegia and paraplegia. Flexor or extensor spasms occur below the level of the spinal cord lesion and can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2084" title="2084"></span>interfere with the rehabilitation process, ADLs, and quality of life (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). Spasticity results from an imbalance between the facilitatory and inhibitory effects on neurons that exist normally. The area of the cord distal to the site of injury or lesion becomes disconnected from the higher inhibitory centers located in the brain, so facilitatory impulses, which originate from muscles, skin, and ligaments, predominate.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Spasticity is defined as a condition of increased muscle tone in a muscle that is weak. Initial resistance to stretching is quickly followed by sudden relaxation. The stimulus that precipitates spasm can be obvious, such as movement or a position change, or subtle, such as a slight jarring of the wheelchair. Most patients with tetraplegia or paraplegia have some degree of spasticity. Because it increases muscle tone, some degree of spasticity can be beneficial in patients who are weak (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>). With SCI, the onset of spasticity usually occurs from a few weeks to 6 months after the injury. The same muscles that are flaccid during the period of spinal shock develop spasticity during recovery. The intensity of spasticity tends to peak approximately 2 years after the injury, after which the spasms tend to regress.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Management of spasticity is based on the severity of symptoms and the degree of incapacitation. Botulinum toxin injections, as well as the antispasmodic medication baclofen, available in an oral and an intrathecal form, may be indicated (<a href="#bib4447">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Oral medications such as diazepam, dantrolene, and tizanidine help control spasms by decreasing sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system. Other forms of adjunctive therapy include oral and transdermal forms of clonidine (<a href="#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). All of the antispasmodic medications cause drowsiness, weakness, and vertigo in some patients. Passive range-of-motion exercises and frequent turning and repositioning are helpful, because stiffness tends to increase spasticity. These activities also are essential in the prevention of contractures, pressure injuries, and bowel and bladder dysfunction.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Infection and Sepsis.</span> Patients with tetraplegia and paraplegia are at increased risk for infection and sepsis from a variety of sources: urinary tract, respiratory tract, and pressure injuries. Sepsis remains a major cause of complications and death in these patients. Prevention of infection and sepsis is essential through maintenance of skin integrity, complete emptying of the bladder at regular intervals, and prevention of urinary and fecal incontinence. The risk for respiratory infection can be decreased by avoiding contact with people who have symptoms of respiratory infection, performing coughing and deep breathing exercises to prevent pooling of respiratory secretions, receiving yearly influenza vaccines, and giving up smoking. A high-protein diet is important in maintaining an adequate immune system, as is avoiding factors that may reduce immune system function, such as excessive stress, drug abuse, and excessive alcohol intake.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If infection occurs, the patient requires thorough assessment and prompt treatment. Antibiotic therapy and adequate hydration, in addition to local measures (depending on the site of infection), are initiated immediately.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">UTIs are minimized or prevented by aseptic technique in catheter management, adequate hydration, a bladder training program, and prevention of overdistention of the bladder and urinary stasis.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Skin breakdown and infection are prevented by the maintenance of a turning schedule; frequent back care; regular assessment of all skin areas; regular cleaning and lubrication of the skin; passive range-of-motion exercise to prevent contractures; pressure relief over broken skin areas, bony prominences, and heels; and wrinkle-free bed linen.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Pulmonary infections are managed and prevented by frequent coughing, turning, and deep breathing exercises and chest physiotherapy; aggressive respiratory care and suctioning of the airway if a tracheostomy is present; assisted coughing as needed; and adequate hydration.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Infections of any kind can be life-threatening. Aggressive nursing interventions are key to prevention, detection, and early management.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care. Patients with tetraplegia or paraplegia are at risk for complications for the rest of their lives. Therefore, a major aspect of nursing care is educating the patient and family about these complications and about strategies to minimize risks. UTIs, contractures, infected pressure injuries, and sepsis may necessitate hospitalization. Other late complications that may occur include lower extremity edema, joint contractures, respiratory dysfunction, and pain. To avoid these and other complications, the patient and family members are educated about skin care, catheter care, range-of-motion exercises, breathing exercises, and other care techniques. Education is initiated as soon as possible and extends into the rehabilitation or long-term care facility and home. In all aspects of care, it is important for the nurse and patient to set mutual goals and discuss the tasks the patient is capable of doing independently and which tasks the patient needs assistance to complete. See <a href="#ct63-9">Chart 63-9</a> for a summary of education points for managing a therapeutic regimen at home.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Referral for home care is often appropriate for assessment of the home setting, patient education, and evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional status. During visits by the nurse, education about strategies to prevent or minimize potential complications is reinforced. The home environment is assessed for adequacy of care and for safety. Environmental modifications are made, and specialized equipment is obtained, ideally before the patient goes home.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s and the family&#x2019;s adherence to recommendations and their use of coping strategies. The use of inappropriate coping strategies (e.g., drug and alcohol use) is assessed, and referrals to counseling are made for the patient and family. Appropriate and effective coping strategies are reinforced. The nurse reviews previous education and determines the need for further physical or psychological assistance. The patient&#x2019;s self-esteem and body image may be extremely poor at this time. Because people with high levels of social support often report feelings of well-being despite major physical disability, it is beneficial for the nurse to assess and promote further development of the support system and effective coping strategies for each patient. Caregivers and peer mentors play a critical role in helping patients feel less dependent, experience feelings of freedom, and reintegrate into the community (<a href="#bib4406">Gassaway, Jones, Sweatman, et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The patient requires continuing, lifelong follow-up by the primary provider, physical therapist, and other rehabilitation team members, because the neurologic deficit is usually permanent and new deficits, complications, and secondary conditions can develop. These require prompt attention before they take their toll in additional physical impairment, time, morale, and financial costs. Research suggests that education and peer mentoring may decrease complications following SCI (<a href="#bib4447">Abrams &#x0026; Wakasa, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib4406">Gassaway et al., 2017</a>). The local counselor for the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation works with the patient with respect to job placement or additional educational or vocational training. The nurse is in a good position to remind patients and family members of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices. Referral to accessible health care providers and imaging centers is important in health promotion and health screening.
