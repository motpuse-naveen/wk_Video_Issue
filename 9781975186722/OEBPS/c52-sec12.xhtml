<p class="nonindent">Breast cancer is a major health problem in the United States. Current statistics indicate that over a lifetime (birth to death), a woman&#x2019;s risk of developing breast cancer is about 12%, or one in eight. Currently, about 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed in women each year. Risk of developing breast cancer increases with increasing age. About two of three invasive breast cancers are found in women 55 years or older. About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary, resulting directly from gene defects (cell mutations) inherited from a biologic parent (ACS, 2019). Female breast cancer incidence rates vary substantially by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic African American women have higher incidence of breast cancer than non-Hispanic Caucasian women before the age of 40 and are more likely to die from breast cancer at every age. Higher death rates in African Americans have been attributed to later stage at diagnosis and poorer stage-specific survival (ACS, 2019).</p>
