<h4 class="h4" id="s1846">Hepatitis D Virus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatitis D virus (delta agent) infection occurs in some cases of hepatitis B. Because the virus requires HBsAg for its replication, only people with hepatitis B are at risk for hepatitis D. Anti-delta antibodies in the presence of HBAg on testing confirm the diagnosis. Hepatitis D is common among those who use IV or injection drugs, patients undergoing hemodialysis, and recipients of multiple blood transfusions. Sexual contact with those who have hepatitis B is considered to be an important mode of transmission of hepatitis B and D. The incubation period varies between 30 and 150 days (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of hepatitis D are similar to those of hepatitis B, except that patients are more likely to develop acute hepatic failure and to progress to chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Treatment is similar to that of other forms of hepatitis. Currently, interferon alfa is the only licensed drug available in the treatment for HDV infection. The rate of recurrence is high, and the efficacy of interferon is related to the dose and duration of treatment. High-dose, long-duration therapy for at least a year is recommended (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3306">Sedhom, D&#x2019;Souza, John, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
