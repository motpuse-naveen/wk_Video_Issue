<p class="nonindent">Acute vascular occlusion may be caused by an embolus or acute thrombosis. Acute arterial occlusions may result from iatrogenic injury, which can occur during insertion of invasive catheters such as those used for arteriography, PTA or stent placement, or an intra-aortic balloon pump, or it may occur as a result of illicit IV drug use. Other causes include trauma from a fracture or dislocation, crush injury, compartment syndrome, and penetrating wounds that disrupt the arterial intima. The accurate diagnosis of an arterial occlusion as embolic or thrombotic in origin is necessary to initiate appropriate treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1000">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial emboli arise most commonly from thrombi that develop in the chambers of the heart as a result of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, infective endocarditis, or chronic heart failure. These thrombi become detached and are carried from the left side of the heart into the arterial system, where they lodge in and obstruct an artery that is smaller than the embolus. Emboli may also develop in advanced aortic atherosclerosis because the atheromatous plaques ulcerate or become rough. Acute thrombosis frequently occurs in patients with preexisting ischemic symptoms.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1001">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of arterial emboli depend primarily on the size of the embolus, organ involvement, and the state of collateral vessels. The immediate effect is cessation of distal blood flow. The blockage can progress distal and proximal to the site of the obstruction. Secondary vasospasm can contribute to the ischemia. The embolus can fragment or break apart, resulting in occlusion of distal vessels. Emboli tend to lodge at arterial bifurcations and areas narrowed by atherosclerosis. Cerebral, mesenteric, renal, and coronary arteries are often involved in addition to the large arteries of the extremities.</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of acute arterial embolism in extremities with poor collateral flow are acute, severe pain, and a gradual loss of sensory and motor function. The six Ps associated with acute arterial embolism are <em>p</em>ain, <em>p</em>allor, <em>p</em>ulselessness, <em>p</em>aresthesia, <em>p</em>oikilothermia (coldness), and <em>p</em>aralysis. Eventually, superficial veins may collapse because of decreased blood flow to the extremity. Because of ischemia, the part of the extremity distal to the occlusion is markedly colder and paler than the part proximal to the occlusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Arterial thrombosis can also acutely occlude an artery. A thrombosis is a slowly developing clot that usually occurs where the arterial wall has become damaged, generally as a result of atherosclerosis. Thrombi may also develop in an arterial aneurysm. The manifestations of an acute thrombotic arterial occlusion are similar to those described for an embolic occlusion. However, treatment is more difficult with a thrombus because the arterial occlusion has occurred in a degenerated vessel and requires more extensive reconstructive surgery to restore flow than is required with an embolic event (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1002">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An arterial embolus is usually diagnosed on the basis of the sudden onset of symptoms and an apparent source for the embolus. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography or transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), chest x-ray, and electrocardiography (ECG) may reveal underlying cardiac disease. Noninvasive duplex and Doppler ultrasonography can determine the presence and extent of underlying atherosclerosis, and arteriography may be performed.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1003">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of arterial thrombosis depends on its cause. Management of acute embolic occlusion usually requires surgery because there is only a 4- to 6-hour window to restore blood flow before irreversible death of tissue. The event is acute with no collateral circulation developed, and the patient quickly moves through the list of six Ps to paralysis, the most advanced stage. Heparin therapy is initiated immediately to prevent further development of emboli and to prevent the extension of existing thrombi. Typically, an initial IV bolus of 60 to 80 U/kg body weight is given, followed by a continuous infusion of 12 to 18 U/kg/h until the patient undergoes an endovascular intervention or surgery (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1937">IBM Watson Health, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endovascular Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Emergency embolectomy is the procedure of choice if the involved extremity is viable (see <a href="#ff26-13">Fig. 26-13</a>). Arterial emboli are usually treated by insertion of an embolectomy catheter. The catheter is passed through an incision into the affected artery and extended through the embolus that is causing the arterial occlusion. The embolectomy catheter balloon is inflated with sterile saline solution, and the thrombus is extracted as the catheter is withdrawn. This procedure involves incising the vessel and removing the clot.</p>
<p class="indent">Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices may also be used for the treatment of an acute thrombosis. All endovascular devices necessitate obtaining access to the patient&#x2019;s arterial system and inserting a catheter into the patient&#x2019;s artery to obtain access to the thrombus. The approach is similar to that used for angiograms, in that it is typically made through the groin to the femoral artery. In select cases, the radial or brachial artery can be accessed, allowing patients to be ambulatory post procedure. To qualify for this approach, the height of the patient is considered to ensure that the length of the catheter can reach the thrombus. Patients who are 5 feet 6 inches or shorter are potential candidates.</p>
<p class="indent">Some endovascular devices require that a small incision (cut-down) be made into the patient&#x2019;s artery. These devices may use a jet of fluid to disrupt the thrombus and then aspirate the particles; a rotating, sinusoidal-shaped wire that mixes a thrombolytic agent that simultaneously dissolves the clot; or high-frequency, low-energy ultrasound to dissolve an occlusive thrombus. Complications arising from the use of any endovascular device may include arterial dissection or distal artery embolization.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient has adequate collateral circulation, treatment may include IV anticoagulation with heparin, which can prevent the thrombus from extending and reduce muscle necrosis. Intra-arterial thrombolytic medications are used to dissolve the embolus. Thrombolytic medications (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA] and single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator) interact with plasminogen to generate plasmin which then breaks down fibrin clots. If t-PA is used for the treatment, heparin is usually given to prevent another thrombus from forming at the site of the lesion. The t-PA activates plasminogen on the thrombus, but it does not decrease the clotting factors as much as other thrombolytic therapies; therefore, patients receiving t-PA can make new thrombi more readily than if they receive other thrombolytics. Other thrombolytic medications are reteplase and tenecteplase (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Millar &#x0026; Laffan, 2017</a>). Although these agents differ in their pharmacokinetics, they are given in a similar manner: A catheter is advanced under x-ray visualization to the clot, and the thrombolytic agent is infused.</p>
<p class="indent">Thrombolytic therapy should not be used when there are known contraindications to therapy or when the extremity cannot tolerate the several additional hours of ischemia that it takes for the agent to lyse (disintegrate) the clot. Contraindications to peripheral thrombolytic therapy include active internal bleeding, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, recent major surgery, uncontrolled hypertension, and pregnancy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1004">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Before an intervention or surgery, the patient remains on bed rest with the affected extremity level or slightly dependent (15 degrees). The affected extremity is kept at room temperature and protected from trauma. Heating and cooling pads are contraindicated because ischemic extremities are easily traumatized by alterations in temperature. If possible, tape and ECG electrodes should not be used on the extremity to protect from trauma. Pressure injury prevention through offloading the heel with a heel device and lifting the bedsheets using a bed cradle are important to protect the affected leg (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1928">European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel, Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance [EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA], 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is treated with thrombolytic therapy, the dose is based on the patient&#x2019;s weight. The patient is admitted to a critical care unit for continuous monitoring. Vital signs are taken initially every 15 minutes and then at progressively longer intervals if the patient&#x2019;s status remains stable. The patient is closely monitored for bleeding. The nurse minimizes the number of punctures for inserting IV lines and obtaining blood samples, avoids intramuscular injections,<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page844" title="844"></span> prevents any possible tissue trauma, and applies pressure at least twice as long as usual after any puncture is performed.</p>
<p class="indent">During the recovery phase, the nurse collaborates with the primary provider about the patient&#x2019;s appropriate activity level based on the patient&#x2019;s condition. Generally, every effort is made to encourage the patient to move the extremity to stimulate circulation and prevent stasis. Anticoagulant therapy may be continued postendovascular intervention to prevent thrombosis of the affected artery and to diminish the development of subsequent thrombi at the initiating site. The nurse assesses for evidence of local and systemic hemorrhage, including mental status changes, which can occur when anticoagulants are given. Pulses, Doppler signals, ABI, and motor and sensory function are assessed every hour for the first 24&#x00A0;hours, because significant changes may indicate reocclusion. Metabolic abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and compartment syndrome may be complications after an acute arterial occlusion.</p>
