<h4 class="h4" id="s1678">Constipation</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;constipation:&lt;/b&gt; fewer than three bowel movements weekly or bowel movements that are hard, dry, small, or difficult to pass">Constipation</button></strong> is defined as fewer than three bowel movements weekly or bowel movements that are hard, dry, small, or difficult to pass (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Simren, Palsson, &#x0026; Whitehead, 2017</a>). Approximately 63 million Americans have chronic constipation, making it a very common GI disorder. People more likely to become constipated are women, particularly pregnant women, patients who recently had surgery, older adults, non-Caucasians, and people with a history of irritable bowel syndrome (NIDDK, 2018). Notably, constipation is a symptom and not a disease; however, constipation can indicate an underlying disease or motility disorder of the GI tract. Perceived constipation can also be an issue. This subjective problem occurs when a person&#x2019;s bowel elimination pattern is not consistent with what they consider normal (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3043">Dimidi, Cox, Grant, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3075">Mari, Mahamid, Amara, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Constipation can be caused by certain medications, such as anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antispasmodics (muscle relaxants), calcium channel antagonists, diuretic agents, opioids, aluminum- and calcium-based antacids, and iron preparations. Other causes of constipation may include weakness, immobility, debility, fatigue, celiac disease, and an inability to increase intra-abdominal pressure to facilitate the passage of stools, as may occur in patients with emphysema or spinal cord injury, for instance. Many people develop constipation because they do not take the time to defecate or ignore the urge to defecate. Constipation is also a result of dietary habits (i.e., low consumption of fiber and inadequate fluid intake), lack of regular exercise, and a stress-filled life (NIDDK, 2018). Fiber is particularly important to bowel health because it increases the bulk of stool, generally easing its passage. One of the most significant benefits of dietary fiber, most of which is derived from plant cell walls, is its fermentability, which affects the diversity of microbes in the GI tract and promotes good bowel wall health (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3120">Williams, Grant, Gidley, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1679">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathophysiology of constipation is poorly understood, but it is thought to include interference with one of three major functions of the colon: mucosal transport (i.e., mucosal secretions facilitate the movement of colon contents), myoelectric activity (i.e., mixing of the rectal mass and propulsive actions), or the processes of defecation (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction). There are four classes of constipation, based upon their underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms (Basson, 2019a):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Functional constipation, which involves normal transit mechanisms of mucosal transport. This type of constipation is most common and can be successfully treated by increasing intake of fiber and fluids.</span></li>
<li><span>Slow-transit constipation, which is caused by inherent disorders of the motor function of the colon (e.g., Hirschsprung disease), and is characterized by infrequent bowel movements.</span></li>
<li><span>Defecatory disorders, which are caused by dysfunctional motor coordination between the pelvic floor and anal sphincter. Dyssynergic constipation is a common cause of chronic constipation and is caused by an inability to coordinate the abdominal, pelvic floor, and rectoanal muscles to defecate. <em>Anismus</em> is a term used to describe pelvic floor dysfunction and constipation. This can cause not only constipation but also fecal incontinence (see later discussion).</span></li>
<li><span>Opioid-induced constipation, which includes new or worsening symptoms that occur when opioid therapy is initiated, changed, or increased and must include two or more symptoms of functional constipation (see later discussion).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The urge to defecate is stimulated normally by rectal distention that initiates a series of four actions: stimulation of the inhibitory rectoanal reflex, relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle, relaxation of the external sphincter muscle and muscles in the pelvic region, and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Interference with any of these processes can lead to constipation.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1287</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1288" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1288">p. 1288</span></div>
<p class="indent">When the urge to defecate is ignored, the rectal mucous membrane and musculature become insensitive to the presence of fecal masses, and consequently a stronger stimulus is required to produce the necessary peristaltic rush for defecation. The initial effect of fecal retention is to produce irritability of the colon, which at this stage frequently goes into spasm, especially after meals, giving rise to colicky midabdominal or low abdominal pains. After several years of this process, the colon loses muscular tone and becomes essentially unresponsive to normal stimuli (similar to an overstretched balloon). Atony or decreased muscle tone occurs with aging. This may lead to constipation because the stool is retained for longer periods.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1680">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations of constipation include fewer than three bowel movements per week; abdominal distention; abdominal pain and bloating; a sensation of incomplete evacuation; straining at stool; and the elimination of small-volume, lumpy, hard, dry stools. The patient may report <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tenesmus:&lt;/b&gt; ineffective and sometimes painful straining and urge to eliminate feces">tenesmus</button></strong> (i.e., ineffective and sometimes painful straining and urge to eliminate feces) or low back pain. Chronic constipation, often associated with psychological disorders, is the presence of these symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the previous year (Basson, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1681">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of constipation is based on the patient&#x2019;s history, physical examination, possibly the results of a barium enema or sigmoidoscopy, and stool testing for occult blood. These tests are used to determine whether this symptom results from spasm or narrowing of the bowel. Anorectal manometry (i.e., pressure studies such as a balloon expulsion test) may be performed to assess malfunction of the sphincter. Defecography and colonic transit studies can also assist in the diagnosis because they permit assessment of active anorectal function. X-ray, colonoscopy, and lower GI endoscopy can be used to evaluate the patient with constipation (Basson, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">As noted previously, the majority of patients with constipation have functional constipation. The Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria provide the framework to make this determination (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Simren, Palsson, &#x0026; Whitehead, 2017</a>) (see Chart 41-1).</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary causes of constipation should be evaluated. Neurologic diseases that can impact bowel function include stroke, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Other causes of secondary constipation include colonic obstruction, rectal or vaginal prolapse, effects of some medications, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and diverticular disease. Diagnostic testing is usually indicated for patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment (e.g., increasing fluids, fiber, physical activity) after 3 to 6 months (Basson, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1682">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Increased arterial pressure can occur with defecation. Straining at stool, which results in the Valsalva maneuver (i.e., forcibly exhaling with the glottis closed), has a striking effect on arterial blood pressure. During active straining, the flow of venous blood in the chest is temporarily impeded because of increased intrathoracic pressure. This pressure tends to collapse the large veins in the chest. The atria and the ventricles receive less blood, and consequently less blood is ejected by the left ventricle. Cardiac output is decreased, and there is a transient drop in arterial pressure, which may cause orthostasis, dizziness, or syncope (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="box3">
<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Constipation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Reported signs and symptoms must be present for the past 3 months with onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis; these must include two or more of the following:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Straining during at least 25% of bowel movements</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lumpy or hard stools from at least 25% of bowel movements</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sensation of incomplete evacuation during at least 25% of bowel movements</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage during at least 25% of bowel movements</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Manual maneuvers (e.g., digital stimulation, support of pelvic floor) needed to facilitate at least 25% of bowel movements</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Less than three spontaneous bowel movements weekly</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">In addition to these, loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives, and there must be insufficient suspicion of irritable bowel syndrome.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Additional complications of constipation include fecal impaction, which may lead to fecal incontinence, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemorrhoids:&lt;/b&gt; dilated portions of the anal veins">hemorrhoids</button></strong> (dilated portions of anal veins), <strong>fissures</strong> (normal or abnormal folds, grooves, or cracks in body tissue), rectal prolapse, and megacolon (see later discussion of disorders of the anorectum, which includes hemorrhoids and fissures). Fecal impaction occurs when an accumulated mass of dry feces, called a <em>fecalith</em>, cannot be expelled. The mass may be palpable on digital examination, may produce pressure on the colonic mucosa that results in ulcer formation, most typically in the rectosigmoid colon, and may cause fecal incontinence, with seepage of liquid stools. Treatment can be embarrassing and also painful, because impaction removal usually involves digital dislodgement and enema administration. An ulcer also has the potential to perforate the colon wall, leading to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;peritonitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity">peritonitis</button></strong> (i.e., inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity) (Basson, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Hemorrhoids develop as a result of perianal vascular congestion caused by straining. Anal fissures may result from the passage of the hard stool through the anus, tearing the lining of the anal canal. The rectum may prolapse through the anal canal, causing seepage of mucus (NIDDK, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Megacolon is a dilated and atonic colon caused by a fecal mass that obstructs the passage of colon contents. Symptoms include constipation, liquid fecal incontinence, and abdominal distention. Megacolon can lead to perforation of the bowel and peritonitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1683"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Visits to primary providers for treatment of constipation are common in people 65 years and older. The most common complaint they voice is the need to strain at stool. The aging process inevitably generates changes in the colon; but the extent and physiologic implications for defecation remain unclear. The clinical situation is made more complex by ubiquitous factors among the aged (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). For <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1289" title="1289"></span>instance, older adults who have loose-fitting dentures or have lost their teeth have difficulty chewing and frequently choose soft, processed foods that are low in fiber. Older adults tend to have decreased food intake, reduced mobility, and weak abdominal and pelvic muscles, and they are more likely to have multiple chronic illnesses requiring multiple medications (polypharmacy) that often cause constipation. Low-fiber convenience foods are widely used by people who have lost interest in eating. Some older adults reduce their fluid intake if they are not eating regular meals. Depression, weakness, and prolonged bed rest also contribute to constipation by decreasing intestinal motility and anal sphincter tone. Nerve impulses are dulled, and there is a decreased urge to defecate. Many older adults overuse laxatives in an attempt to have a daily bowel movement and become dependent on them. Chronic constipation profoundly impairs quality of life comparable to other conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1684">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment targets the underlying cause of constipation and prevention of recurrence. It includes education, exercise, bowel habit training, increased fiber and fluid intake, and judicious use of laxatives. Management may also include discontinuing laxative use or replacing medications that could cause or exacerbate constipation with other nonconstipating medications (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3071">Lacy, Mearin, Chang, et al., 2016</a>). Patients can be educated to sit on the toilet with legs supported and to utilize the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gastrocolic reflex:&lt;/b&gt; peristaltic movements of the large bowel occurring five to six times daily that are triggered by distention of the stomach">gastrocolic reflex</button></strong> (peristaltic movements of the large bowel occurring five to six times daily that are triggered by distention of the stomach) by attempting to defecate following a meal and a warm drink. Routine exercise to strengthen abdominal muscles is encouraged. Biofeedback is a technique that can be used to help patients learn to relax the sphincter mechanism to expel stool. Biofeedback is an effective therapy for patients with dyssynergic defecation and is considered first-line therapy once anorectal structural lesions have been excluded as the cause for constipation (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rao &#x0026; Patcharatrakul, 2016</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3099">Rao, Valestin, Xiang, et al., 2018</a>). Daily dietary intake of 25 to 30 g/day of fiber (soluble and bulk forming) is recommended, especially for the treatment of constipation in the older adult. It is important to add fiber to the diet slowly in order to avoid adverse effects such as abdominal cramping and bloating. Fiber is increased daily in 5 g increments, along with encouraging fluid intake (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Mari et al., 2020</a>). If laxative use is necessary, one of the following may be prescribed: bulk-forming agents (fiber laxatives), saline and osmotic agents, lubricants, stimulants, or emollient stool softeners. The physiologic action and patient education information related to these laxatives are presented in <a href="c41-sec02.xhtml#tt41-1">Table 41-1</a>. Enemas and rectal suppositories are generally not recommended for treating constipation unless other medications have failed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1685">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse elicits information about the onset and duration of constipation, current and past elimination patterns, the patient&#x2019;s expectation of normal bowel elimination, and lifestyle information (e.g., exercise and activity level, occupation, food and fluid intake, and stress level) during the health history interview. Past medical and surgical history, current medications, and laxative and enema use are important, as is information about the sensation of rectal pressure or fullness, abdominal pain, excessive straining at defecation, and flatulence.</p>
<div class="box11a"><p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct41-2"><strong>Chart 41-2 <img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Preventing Constipation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize the physiology of defecation and the importance of responding to the urge to defecate.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Understand the normal variations in patterns of defecation.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Establish a bowel routine, and be aware that having a regular time for defecation (e.g., best time is after a meal) may aid in initiating the reflex.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ensure proper dietary habits, such as eating high-residue, high-fiber foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables); adding fiber to the diet slowly with adequate fluid intake; choosing dietary sources of fiber, which are preferred over fiber supplements; adding bran daily (must be introduced gradually); and increasing fluid intake (unless contraindicated) to help prevent constipation.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Increase muscle strength through an exercise regimen, increased ambulation, and abdominal muscle toning to help propel colon contents.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perform abdominal toning exercises, including contracting abdominal muscles 4 times daily and leg-to-chest lifts 10 to 20 times each day.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use the normal position (semisquatting) to maximize the use of abdominal muscles and force of gravity.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid overuse or long-term use of stimulant laxatives.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">After the health history is obtained, the nurse sets specific goals for patient education (see Chart 41-2). Goals for the patient include restoring or maintaining a regular pattern of elimination by responding to the urge to defecate, ensuring adequate intake of fluids and high-fiber foods, learning about methods to avoid constipation, relieving anxiety about bowel elimination patterns, and avoiding complications.</p>
