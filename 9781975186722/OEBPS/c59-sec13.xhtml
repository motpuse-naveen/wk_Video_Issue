<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;otosclerosis:&lt;/b&gt; a condition characterized by abnormal spongy bone formation around the stapes">Otosclerosis</button></strong> involves the stapes and is thought to result from the formation of new, abnormal spongy bone, especially around the oval window, with resulting fixation of the stapes (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>). The efficient transmission of sound is prevented because the stapes cannot vibrate and carry the sound as conducted from the malleus and incus to the inner ear. Otosclerosis is more common in women, is a familial condition, and can progress to complete deafness (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>; <a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2885">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Otosclerosis may involve one or both ears and manifests as a progressive conductive or mixed hearing loss. The patient may or may not complain of tinnitus. Otoscopic examination usually reveals a normal tympanic membrane. Bone conduction is better than air conduction on Rinne testing. The audiogram confirms conductive hearing loss or mixed loss, especially in the low frequencies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2886">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of otosclerosis can be surgical or medical. Amplification with a hearing aid may help (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One of two surgical procedures may be performed: the stapedectomy or the stapedotomy. A stapedectomy involves removing the stapes superstructure and part of the footplate and inserting a tissue graft and a suitable prosthesis (see Fig.&#x00A0;59-6). In a stapedotomy, the surgeon drills a small hole into the stapes, instead of removing it, to hold a prosthesis. In both procedures, the prosthesis bridges the gap between the incus and the inner ear, providing better sound conduction. The majority of patients experience resolution of conductive hearing loss following stapes surgery. The use of sodium fluoride in the postoperative period increases the success rate and hearing ability postoperatively (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>). Balance disturbance or true vertigo may occur during the postoperative period for several days. Long-term balance disorders are rare.</p>
