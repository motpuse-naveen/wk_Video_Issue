<h4 class="h4" id="s2967">The Epilepsies</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Epilepsy is a group of syndromes characterized by unprovoked, recurring seizures (AANN, 2016a). Epileptic syndromes are classified by specific patterns of clinical features, including age at onset, family history, and seizure type. Epilepsy can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (when the cause is known and the epilepsy is a symptom of another underlying condition, such as a brain tumor).</p>
<p class="indent">Epilepsy affects an estimated 3% of people during their lifetime, and most forms of epilepsy occur in children and older adults (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The improved treatment for cerebrovascular disorders, head injuries, brain tumors, meningitis, and encephalitis has increased the number of patients at risk for seizures after recovery from these conditions. In addition, advances in EEG have aided in the diagnosis of epilepsy. The general public has been educated about epilepsy, which has reduced the stigma associated with it; as a result, more people are willing to acknowledge that they have epilepsy.</p>
<p class="indent">Although some evidence suggests that susceptibility to some types of epilepsy may be inherited, the cause of seizures in many people is idiopathic (unknown). Epilepsy can follow birth trauma, asphyxia neonatorum, head injuries, some infectious diseases (bacterial, viral, parasitic), toxicity (carbon monoxide and lead poisoning), circulatory problems, fever, metabolic and nutritional disorders, or drug or alcohol intoxication. It is also associated with brain tumors, abscesses, and congenital malformations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2968">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Messages from the body are carried by the neurons (nerve cells) of the brain by discharges of electrochemical energy that sweep along them. These impulses occur in bursts whenever a nerve cell has a task to perform. Sometimes, these cells or groups of cells continue firing after a task is finished. During the period of unwanted discharges, parts of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2021" title="2021"></span>body controlled by the errant cells may perform erratically. Resultant dysfunction ranges from mild to incapacitating and often causes loss of consciousness (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). If these uncontrolled, abnormal discharges occur repeatedly, a person is said to have an epileptic syndrome. Epilepsy is not associated with intellectual level. People who have epilepsy without other brain or nervous system disabilities fall within the same intelligence ranges as the overall population. Epilepsy is not synonymous with intellectual or developmental disabilities, but many people who have these types of disabilities, because of serious neurologic damage, also have epilepsy.</p>

<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ease the patient to the floor, if possible.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Protect the head with a pad to prevent injury (from striking a hard surface).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Loosen constrictive clothing and remove eyeglasses.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Push aside any furniture that may injure the patient during the seizure.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the patient is in bed, remove pillows and raise side rails.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Do not attempt to pry open jaws that are clenched in a spasm or attempt to insert anything in the mouth during a seizure.</em> Broken teeth and injury to the lips and tongue may result from such an action.</p>

<p class="indent">Patients with epilepsy, particularly those with generalized events that are medically refractory, are at serious risk for <strong>Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP</strong>)<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bundle:&lt;/b&gt; a set of three to five evidence-based practices that, when implemented appropriately, can measurably improve patient outcomes"></button></strong>, defined as nontraumatic, nondrowning unexpected death of a patient with epilepsy. These events may be witnessed or unwitnessed and postmortem examination reveals no anatomic or toxicologic cause of death. Cardiac and respiratory abnormalities have been implicated in these deaths. SUDEP may or may not be related to a seizure event (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Barot &#x0026; Nei, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2969">Epilepsy in Women</h5>
<p class="nonindent">More than one million American women have epilepsy, and they face particular needs associated with the syndrome. Women with epilepsy often note an increase in seizure frequency during menses; this has been linked to the increase <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2022" title="2022"></span>in sex hormones that alter the excitability of neurons in the cerebral cortex. The effectiveness of contraceptives is decreased by anticonvulsant medications. Therefore, patients should be encouraged to discuss family planning with their primary provider and to obtain preconception counseling if they are considering childbearing (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4335">Stephen, Harden, Tomson, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Women of childbearing age who have epilepsy require special care and guidance before, during, and after pregnancy. Many women note a change in the pattern of seizure activity during pregnancy. The risk of congenital fetal anomaly is two to three times higher in women with epilepsy. Maternal seizures, anticonvulsant medications, and genetic predisposition all contribute to possible malformations. Women who take certain anticonvulsant medications for epilepsy are at risk and need careful monitoring, including blood studies to detect the level of anticonvulsant medications taken throughout pregnancy. Mothers who are at high risk (teenagers, women with histories of difficult deliveries, women who use illicit drugs [e.g., &#x201C;crack&#x201D; cocaine, heroin], and women with diabetes or hypertension) should be identified and monitored closely during pregnancy, because damage to the fetus during pregnancy and delivery can increase the risk of epilepsy. All of these issues need further study (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Stephen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because of bone loss associated with the long-term use of anticonvulsant medications, patients receiving anticonvulsant agents should be assessed for low bone mass and osteoporosis. They should be educated about strategies to reduce their risks of osteoporosis (AANN, 2016a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2970"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults have a high incidence of new-onset epilepsy (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of seizures in the older adult but they are also associated with head injury, dementia, infection, alcoholism, and aging. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Because many older adults have chronic health problems, they may be taking other medications that can interact with medications prescribed for seizure control. In addition, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medications are altered in the older adult as a result of age-related changes in renal and liver function. Therefore, older adult patients must be monitored closely for adverse and toxic effects of anticonvulsant medications and for osteoporosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2971">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Society-wide efforts are the key to prevention of epilepsy. Head injury is one of the main causes of epilepsy that can be prevented. Through highway safety programs and occupational safety precautions, lives can be saved and epilepsy due to head injury prevented; these programs are discussed in <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2972">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of epilepsy is individualized to meet the needs of each patient and not just to manage and prevent seizures. Management differs from patient to patient, because some forms of epilepsy arise from brain damage and others result from altered brain chemistry.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many medications are available to control seizures, although the exact mechanisms of action are unknown. The objective is to achieve seizure control with minimal side effects. Medication therapy controls&#x2014;rather than cures&#x2014;seizures. Medications are selected on the basis of the type of seizure being treated and the effectiveness and safety of the medications. If properly prescribed and taken, medications control seizures in 70% to 80% of patients with seizures. However, 20% of patients with generalized seizures and 30% of those with focal seizures do not demonstrate improvement with any prescribed medication or may be unable to tolerate the side effects of medications (AANN, 2016a). <a href="#tt61-5">Table 61-5</a> lists select anticonvulsant medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment usually starts with a single medication. The starting dose and the rate at which the dosage is increased depend on the occurrence of side effects. The medication levels in the blood are monitored, because the rate of drug absorption varies among patients. Changing to another medication may be necessary if seizure control is not achieved or if toxicity makes it impossible to increase the dosage. The medication may need to be adjusted because of concurrent illness, weight changes, or increases in stress. Side effects of anticonvulsant medications may be divided into three groups: idiosyncratic or allergic disorders, which manifest primarily as skin reactions; acute toxicity, which may occur when the medication is initially prescribed; and chronic toxicity, which occurs late in the course of therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The manifestations of drug toxicity are variable, and any organ system may be involved. For example, gingival hyperplasia (swollen and tender gums) can be associated with long-term use of phenytoin (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Periodic physical and dental examinations and laboratory tests are performed for patients receiving medications that are known to have hematopoietic, genitourinary, or hepatic effects.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is indicated for patients whose epilepsy results from intracranial tumors, abscesses, cysts, or vascular anomalies. Some patients have intractable seizure disorders that do not respond to medication. A focal atrophic process may occur secondary to trauma, inflammation, stroke, or anoxia. If the seizures originate in a reasonably well-circumscribed area of the brain that can be excised without producing significant neurologic deficits, the removal of the area generating the seizures may produce long-term control and improvement (AANN, 2016a).</p>
<p class="indent">This type of neurosurgery has been aided by several advances, including microsurgical techniques, EEGs with depth electrodes, improved illumination and hemostasis, and the introduction of neuroleptanalgesic agents (droperidol and fentanyl). These techniques, combined with the use of local anesthetic agents, enable the neurosurgeon to perform surgery on an alert and cooperative patient. Using special testing devices, electrocortical mapping, and the patient&#x2019;s responses to stimulation, the boundaries of the epileptogenic focus (i.e., abnormal area of the brain) are determined. Any abnormal epileptogenic focus is then excised (AANN, 2016a). Resection surgery significantly reduces the incidence of seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy.</p>

<p class="indent">When seizures are refractory to medication in adolescents and adults with focal seizures, a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) may be implanted under the clavicle. The device is connected to the vagus nerve in the cervical area, where it delivers electrical signals to the brain to control and reduce seizure activity. An external programming system is used by the primary provider to change stimulator settings (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4338">Tzadok, Harush, Nissenkorn, et al., 2019</a>). Patients can activate the stimulator with a magnet at the time of a seizure or aura. Some patients report that use of the VNS diminishes the severity or duration of the seizure. Complications such as infection, cardiac arrhythmias, hoarseness, cough, and laryngeal spasm can occur with the use of this device (AANN, 2016a).</p>
<p class="indent">Another surgical option for patients with refractory seizure activity is the responsive neurostimulation system (RNS). This is a surgically implanted device with electrodes that sense and record brain electrical activity. Electrodes deliver an electrical stimulation to the location of seizure origination within the brain. The RNS works by interrupting brainwave activity before a clinical seizure can occur (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Wong, Mani, &#x0026; Danish, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with well-defined or anatomically deep epileptogenic lesions, MRI-guided stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LiTT) offers a less invasive treatment option. This treatment involves computer-assisted placement of a laser probe into the brain and delivery of heat therapy. Decisions about epilepsy surgery are complex, and these patients should be referred to epilepsy centers for further evaluation (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Crepeau &#x0026; Sirven, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">More research is needed to determine the effects of the various surgical approaches on complication rates, quality of life, anxiety, and depression, all of which are issues for patients with epilepsy.</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse elicits information about the patient&#x2019;s seizure history. The patient is asked about the factors or events that may precipitate the seizures. Alcohol intake is documented. The nurse determines whether the patient has an aura before an epileptic seizure, which may indicate the origin of the seizure (e.g., seeing a flashing light may indicate that the seizure originated in the occipital lobe). Observation and assessment during and after a seizure assist in identifying the type of seizure and its management.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The effects of epilepsy on the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle are assessed (AANN, 2016a). What limitations are imposed by the seizure disorder? Does the patient participate in any recreational activities? Have any social contacts? Is the patient working, and is it a positive or stressful experience? What coping mechanisms are used?</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> I<span class="small">NJURY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Injury prevention for the patient with seizures is a priority. Patients for whom seizure precautions are instituted should have pads applied to the side rails while in bed. Steps to prevent or minimize injury are presented in <a href="#ct61-5">Chart 61-5</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EDUCING</span> F<span class="small">EAR OF</span> S<span class="small">EIZURES</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Fear that a seizure may occur unexpectedly can be reduced by the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Cooperation of the patient and family and their trust in the prescribed regimen are essential for control of seizures. The nurse emphasizes that the prescribed anticonvulsant medication must be taken on a continuing basis and that drug dependence or addiction does not occur. Periodic monitoring is necessary to ensure the adequacy of the treatment regimen, to prevent side effects, and to monitor for drug resistance (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In an effort to control seizures, factors that may precipitate them are identified, such as emotional disturbances, new environmental stressors, onset of menstruation in female patients, or fever (AANN, 2016a). The patient is encouraged to follow a regular and moderate routine in lifestyle, diet (avoiding excessive stimulants), exercise, and rest (sleep deprivation may lower the seizure threshold). Moderate activity is therapeutic, but excessive exercise should be avoided. An additional dietary intervention, referred to as the ketogenic diet or the Modified Atkins diet, may be helpful for control of seizures in some patients. This high-protein, low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet is most effective in children whose seizures have not been controlled with two anticonvulsant medications and has shown some success in adults with poor seizure control. Dietary therapy is not without risk and requires close monitoring and medical follow-up for possible side effects of therapy such as hyperlipidemia, malnutrition, weight loss, and osteoporosis (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Crepeau &#x0026; Sirven, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Photic stimulation (e.g., bright flickering lights, television viewing) may precipitate seizures; wearing dark glasses or covering one eye may be preventive. Tension states (anxiety, frustration) induce seizures in some patients. Classes in stress management may be of value. Because seizures are known to occur with alcohol intake, alcoholic beverages should be avoided.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> C<span class="small">OPING</span> M<span class="small">ECHANISMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The social, psychological, and behavioral problems that frequently accompany epilepsy can be more of a disability than the actual seizures. Epilepsy may be accompanied by feelings of stigmatization, alienation, depression, and uncertainty (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The patient must cope with the constant fear of a seizure and the psychological consequences (AANN, 2016a). Children with epilepsy may be ostracized and excluded from school and peer activities. These problems are compounded during adolescence and add to the challenges of dating, not being able to drive, and feeling different from other people. Adults face these problems in addition to the burden of finding employment, concerns about relationships and childbearing, insurance problems, and legal barriers. Substance use disorders may complicate matters. Family reactions may vary from outright rejection of the person with epilepsy to overprotection.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Counseling assists the patient and family to understand the condition and the limitations it imposes. Social and recreational opportunities are necessary for good mental health. Nurses can improve the quality of life for patients with epilepsy by educating them and their families about symptoms and their management (AANN, 2016a).</p>

<p class="processppara">Perhaps the most valuable facets of care contributed by the nurse to the person with epilepsy are education and efforts to modify the attitudes of the patient and family toward the disorder. The person who experiences seizures may consider every seizure a potential source of humiliation and shame. This may result in anxiety, depression, hostility, and secrecy on the part of the patient and family. Ongoing education and encouragement should be given to patients to enable them to overcome these reactions. The patient with epilepsy should carry an emergency medical identification card or wear a medical information bracelet. The patient and family need to be educated about medications as well as care during a seizure.</p>

<p class="processppara">Status epilepticus is the major potential complication and is described later in this chapter. Another complication is the toxicity of medications. The patient and family are educated about side effects and are given specific guidelines to assess and report signs and symptoms that indicate medication overdose. Anticonvulsant medications require careful monitoring for therapeutic levels. The patient should plan to have serum drug levels assessed at regular intervals. Many known drug interactions occur with anticonvulsant medications. A complete pharmacologic profile should be reviewed with the patient to avoid interactions that either potentiate or inhibit the effectiveness of the medications.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Thorough oral hygiene after each meal, gum massage, daily flossing, and regular dental care are essential to prevent or control gingival hyperplasia in patients receiving phenytoin. The patient is also educated to inform all health care providers of the medication being taken, because of the possibility of drug interactions. An individualized comprehensive education plan is needed to assist the patient and family to adjust to this chronic disorder. Written patient education materials must be appropriate for the patient&#x2019;s reading level and must be provided in alternative formats if warranted.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Because epilepsy can be lifelong, health promotion is important. See <a href="#ct61-6">Chart 61-6</a> for health promotion strategies for the patient with epilepsy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For many patients with epilepsy, overcoming employment problems is a challenge. State vocational rehabilitation agencies can provide information about job training. The EFA has a training and placement service. If seizures are not well controlled, information about sheltered workshops or home employment programs may be obtained. Federal and state agencies and federal legislation may be of assistance to people with epilepsy who experience job discrimination. As a result of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the number of employers who knowingly hire people with epilepsy is increasing, but barriers to employment still exist.</p>

<p class="Box15pTitle"><strong>Strategies for the Patient with Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p class="Box15BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take anticonvulsant medications daily as prescribed to keep the drug level constant to prevent seizures. Never discontinue medications, even if there is no seizure activity.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep a medication and seizure record (in electronic or paper format), noting when medications are taken and any seizure activity.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Notify the primary provider if unable to take medications due to illness.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have anticonvulsant medication serum levels checked regularly. When testing is prescribed, report to the laboratory for blood sampling before taking morning medication.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid activities that require alertness and coordination (driving, operating machinery) until after the effects of the medication have been evaluated.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Report signs of toxicity so that dosage can be adjusted. Common signs include drowsiness, lethargy, dizziness, difficulty walking, hyperactivity, confusion, inappropriate sleep, and visual disturbances.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid over-the-counter medications unless approved by the primary provider.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Carry a medical alert bracelet or identification card specifying the name of the anticonvulsant medication and primary provider.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid seizure triggers, such as alcoholic beverages, electrical shocks, stress, caffeine, constipation, fever, hyperventilation, and hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take showers rather than tub baths to avoid drowning if seizure occurs; never swim alone.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Exercise in moderation in a temperature-controlled environment to avoid excessive heat.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Develop regular sleep patterns to minimize fatigue and insomnia.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware of and use the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) special services, including help in obtaining medications, vocational rehabilitation, and coping with epilepsy.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Patients who have uncontrollable seizures accompanied by psychological and social difficulties should be referred as early as possible to a comprehensive epilepsy center where continuous audio&#x2013;video and EEG monitoring, specialized treatment, and rehabilitation services are available (AANN, 2016a). Patients and their families need to be reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screenings to promote a healthy lifestyle. Genetic and preconception counseling is advised.</p>
