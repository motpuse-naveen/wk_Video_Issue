<h4 class="h4" id="s2496">Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Assessing the male reproductive system includes a targeted health history and physical examination.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2497">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Male sexuality is a complex phenomenon that is strongly influenced by personal, cultural, religious, and social factors. Sexuality and male reproductive function become concerns in the presence of illness and disability (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3858">Kaufman, Lapauw, Mahmoud, et al., 2019</a>). Throughout the assessment process, the nurse must recognize the significance of sexuality to the patient. Assessment of male reproductive function begins with an evaluation of urinary function and symptoms. The patient is asked about his usual state of health and any recent change in general physical and sexual activity. Any symptoms or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1746" title="1746"></span>changes in function are explored fully and described in detail. Symptoms related to bladder function and urination, collectively referred to as prostatism, are explored further. Symptoms may occur with an obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate gland and may include increased urinary frequency, decreased force of urine stream, and &#x201C;double&#x201D; or &#x201C;triple&#x201D; voiding (the patient needs to urinate two or three times over a period of several minutes to completely empty his bladder). The patient is also assessed for dysuria (painful urination), hematuria (blood in the urine), nocturia (urination during the night), and hematospermia (blood in the ejaculate).</p>

<p class="indent">Assessment also involves addressing sexual function, including manifestations of sexual dysfunction. The extent of the history depends on the patient&#x2019;s presenting symptoms and the presence of factors that may affect sexual function such as chronic illnesses or disability (e.g., diabetes, multiple sclerosis, stroke, cardiac disease), the use of medications that affect sexual function (e.g., antihypertensive and anticholesterolemic medications, psychotropic agents), stress, the use of alcohol, and the patient&#x2019;s willingness to discuss sexual issues.</p>
<p class="indent">By initiating an assessment about sexual concerns, the nurse conveys the message that changes in sexual functioning are valid topics and provides a safe environment for discussing these sensitive topics. Several models are available to assist in assessing patient&#x2019;s problems and concerns. The PLISSIT (<em>p</em>ermission, <em>l</em>imited <em>i</em>nformation, <em>s</em>pecific <em>s</em>uggestions, <em>i</em>ntensive <em>t</em>herapy) model of sexual assessment and intervention may be used to provide a framework for nursing interventions (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3821">Annon, 1976</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Messelis, Kazer, &#x0026; Gelmetti, 2019</a>). It provides a graded counseling approach that allows health care professionals to deal with sexual issues with a level of comfort and expertise. The model begins by asking the patient&#x2019;s permission (P) to discuss sexual functioning. Limited information (LI) about sexual function may then be provided to the patient. As the discussion progresses, the nurse may offer specific suggestions (SS) for interventions. A professional who specializes in sex therapy may provide more intensive therapy (IT) as needed. The BETTER (<em>b</em>ringing up the topic, <em>e</em>xplaining, <em>t</em>elling, <em>t</em>iming, <em>e</em>ducate about treatment-related sexual side effects, <em>r</em>ecording) model was developed more recently to assist health care professionals to include sexuality in the assessment of patients with cancer (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Campbell, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may find it difficult to express their feelings and concerns regarding their sexuality, especially after a body image change (e.g., after major surgery such as amputation). Discussing sexuality with patients who have an illness or disability can be uncomfortable for nurses and other health care providers; this, in turn, makes discussion of these issues more difficult and uncomfortable for patients. Some health care professionals may unconsciously have stereotypes about the sexuality of people who are ill or have a disability (e.g., the belief that people with disability are asexual or should be sexually inactive). In addition, patients are often embarrassed to initiate a discussion about sexual issues with their health care providers (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Campbell, 2020</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3832">Katz, Cherven, Ballard, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2498">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the usual aspects of the physical examination, two essential components address disorders of the male genital or reproductive system: the DRE and the testicular examination.</p>

<img src="images/ff53-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff53-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;53-2 &#x2022;</span> <strong>A.</strong> Palpation of the prostate gland during digital rectal examination enables the examiner to assess the size, shape, and texture of the gland. <strong>B.</strong> The prostate is round, with a palpable median sulcus or groove separating the lateral lobes. It should feel rubbery and free of nodules and masses.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Digital Rectal Examination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The DRE is used to screen for prostate cancer and is recommended annually for every man older than 50 years (45 years for men at high risk [African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in first-degree relatives]) (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3820">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2020</a>). The DRE enables the skilled examiner, using a lubricated, gloved finger placed in the rectum, to assess the size, symmetry, shape, and consistency of the posterior surface of the prostate gland (see <span class="chart">Fig.&#x00A0;53-2</span>). The clinician assesses for tenderness of the prostate gland on palpation and for the presence and consistency of any nodules. The DRE may be performed with the patient leaning over an examination table or positioning the man in a side-lying position with legs flexed toward the abdomen or supine with legs resting in stirrups. To minimize discomfort and relax the anal sphincter during the rectal examination, the patient is instructed to take a deep breath and exhale slowly as the practitioner inserts a finger. If possible, he should turn his feet inward, so that his toes are touching. Although this examination may be uncomfortable and embarrassing for the patient, it is an important screening tool.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Testicular Examination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The male genitalia are inspected for abnormalities and palpated for masses. The scrotum is palpated carefully for nodules, masses, or inflammation. Examination of the scrotum can reveal such disorders as hydrocele, inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, orchitis, epididymitis, or a tumor of the testis. The penis is inspected and palpated for ulcerations, nodules, inflammation, discharge, and curvature. If the patient is uncircumcised, the foreskin should be retracted for visualization of the glans penis. The testicular examination provides an excellent opportunity to educate the patient on how to perform a testicular self-examination (TSE) and its importance in early detection of testicular cancer. TSE should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1747" title="1747"></span>begin during adolescence. For more details on TSE, see later discussion in the chapter.</p>
