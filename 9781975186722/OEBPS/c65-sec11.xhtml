<h4 class="h4" id="s3115">Herniation of a Cervical Intervertebral Disc</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The cervical spine is subjected to stresses that result from disc degeneration (due to aging, improper body mechanics) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spondylosis:&lt;/b&gt; degenerative changes occurring in a disc and adjacent vertebral bodies; can occur in the cervical or lumbar vertebrae">spondylosis</button></strong> (degenerative changes occurring in a disc and adjacent vertebral bodies). Cervical disc degeneration may lead to lesions that can cause damage to the spinal cord and its roots (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3116">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A cervical disc herniation usually occurs at the C5&#x2013;C6 or C6&#x2013;C7 interspaces and compresses a unilateral nerve root (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Pain and stiffness may occur in the neck, the top of the shoulders, and the region of the scapulae. Patients sometimes interpret these signs as symptoms of heart trouble or bursitis. Pain may also occur in the arm and hand, accompanied by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;paresthesia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal sensation (e.g., burning, tingling, numbness)">paresthesia</button></strong> (numbness, tingling, or a &#x201C;pins and needles&#x201D; sensation) of the upper extremity. Cervical MRI usually confirms the diagnosis. Occasionally, the disc herniates centrally onto the spinal cord, causing Lhermitte syndrome, an electriclike shock sensation in the extremities or spine with neck flexion or straining, and myelopathy (bilateral arm and leg weakness). Myelopathy indicates compression of the spinal cord. The patient may exhibit a decrease in fine motor skills, difficulty with ambulation, difficulty with bowel and bladder control, and respiratory impairment if compression has occurred high in the cervical spine (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hemmer, 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3117">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of treatment are to rest and immobilize the cervical spine to give the soft tissues time to heal and to reduce inflammation in the supporting tissues and the affected nerve roots in the cervical spine (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). It also reduces inflammation and edema in soft tissues around the disc, relieving pressure on the nerve roots. Proper positioning on a firm mattress may bring dramatic relief from pain.</p>
<p class="indent">The cervical spine may be rested and immobilized by a cervical collar, cervical traction, or a brace. A collar allows maximal opening of the intervertebral foramina and holds the head in a neutral or slightly flexed position. The patient may have to wear the collar 24 hours a day during the acute phase. The skin under the collar is inspected for irritation. After the patient is free of pain, cervical isometric exercises are started to strengthen the neck muscles.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Analgesic agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], acetaminophen/oxycodone, or acetaminophen/hydrocodone) are prescribed during the acute phase to relieve pain, and sedative agents may be given to control the anxiety that is often associated with cervical disc disease. Muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, metaxalone) are prescribed for less than 1 week to interrupt muscle spasm and to promote comfort (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) or corticosteroids are prescribed to treat the inflammation and swelling that usually occurs in the affected nerve roots and supporting tissues. Occasionally, a corticosteroid is injected into the epidural space for relief of radicular pain. NSAIDs are given with food to prevent gastrointestinal irritation (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Hot, moist compresses (for 10 to 20 minutes) applied to the back of the neck several times daily increase blood flow to the muscles and help relax the patient and reduce muscle spasm.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical excision of the herniated disc may be necessary if there is a significant neurologic deficit, progression of the deficit, evidence of cord compression, or pain that either worsens or fails to improve. A cervical discectomy, with or without fusion, may be performed to alleviate symptoms. An anterior surgical approach may be used through a transverse incision to remove disc material that has herniated into the spinal canal and foramina, or a posterior approach may be used at the appropriate level of the cervical spine. Potential complications with the anterior approach include carotid or vertebral artery injury, recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction, esophageal perforation, and airway obstruction (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Complications of the posterior approach include damage to the nerve root or the spinal cord due to retraction or contusion of either of these structures, resulting in weakness of muscles supplied by the nerve root or cord.</p>
<p class="indent">Microsurgery, such as endoscopic microdiscectomy, may be performed in select patients through a small incision, using magnification techniques. This usually results in less tissue trauma and pain, and patients consequently have a shorter length of hospital stay compared with those who have conventional surgery (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient is asked about past injuries to the neck, such as whiplash injury, because unresolved trauma can cause persistent discomfort, pain and tenderness, and symptoms of arthritis in the injured joint of the cervical spine. Assessment includes determining the onset, location, and radiation of pain and assessing for paresthesias, limited movement, and diminished function of the neck, shoulders, and upper extremities. It is important to determine whether the symptoms are bilateral; with large herniations, bilateral symptoms may be caused by cord compression. The area around the cervical spine is palpated to assess muscle tone and tenderness. Range of motion in the neck and shoulders is evaluated.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is asked about any health issues that may influence the postoperative course and quality of life. It is also important to assess mood and stress levels. The nurse determines the patient&#x2019;s need for information about the surgical procedure and reinforces what the primary provider has explained. Strategies for pain management are discussed with the patient (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with the surgical procedure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired mobility associated with the postoperative surgical regimen</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about the postoperative course and home care management</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hematoma at the surgical site, resulting in cord compression and neurologic deficit</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recurrent or persistent pain after surgery</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient may include relief of pain, improved mobility, increased knowledge and self-care ability, and prevention of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Incisional pain is expected. Radicular pain improves over time as the nerve recovers. If the patient has had a bone fusion with bone removed from the iliac crest, considerable pain may be experienced at the donor site. Interventions consist of monitoring the donor site for hematoma formation, administering the prescribed postoperative analgesic agent, positioning for comfort, and reassuring the patient that the pain can be relieved. If the patient experiences a sudden increase in pain, extrusion of the graft may have occurred, requiring reoperation. A sudden increase in pain should be promptly reported to the surgeon (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Lall, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2135</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2136" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2136">p. 2136</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient may experience a sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia due to temporary edema. These symptoms are relieved by throat lozenges, voice rest, and humidification. A pureed diet may be given if the patient has dysphagia.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">I<small>MPROVING</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Postoperatively, a cervical collar (neck orthosis) may be worn, which contributes to limited neck motion and altered mobility. The patient is instructed to turn the body instead of the neck when looking from side to side. The neck should be kept in a neutral (midline) position. The patient is assisted during position changes to make sure that the head, shoulders, and thorax are kept aligned. When assisting the patient to a sitting position, the nurse supports the patient&#x2019;s neck and shoulders. To increase stability, the patient should wear shoes when ambulating. The patient is encouraged not to lift more than 10 pounds.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is evaluated for bleeding and hematoma formation by assessing for swelling, excessive pressure in the neck, or severe pain in the incision area. The dressing is inspected for serosanguineous drainage, which suggests a dural leak. If this occurs, meningitis is a threat. A complaint of headache requires careful evaluation. Neurologic checks are made for swallowing deficits and upper and lower extremity weakness, because cord compression may produce rapid or delayed onset of paralysis (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The patient who has had an anterior cervical discectomy is also assessed for a sudden return of radicular (spinal nerve root) pain, which may indicate instability of the spine (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hemmer, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Throughout the postoperative course, the patient is monitored frequently to detect any signs of respiratory difficulty, because retractors used during surgery may injure the laryngeal nerve, resulting in hoarseness and the inability to cough effectively and clear pulmonary secretions. In addition, the blood pressure and pulse are monitored to evaluate cardiovascular status and optimal circulation to the surgical site.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Bleeding at the surgical site and subsequent hematoma formation may occur. Severe localized pain not relieved by analgesic agents should be reported. A change in neurologic status (motor or sensory function) should be reported promptly, because it suggests hematoma formation that may necessitate surgery to prevent irreversible motor and sensory deficits (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="h4a"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient&#x2019;s length of hospital stay is likely to be short; therefore, the patient and family should understand the care that is important for a smooth recovery. A cervical collar, if prescribed, is usually worn for about 6 weeks. The patient is educated in the use and care of the cervical collar. The patient will need to alternate tasks that involve minimal body movement (e.g., reading) with tasks that require greater body movement.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is educated about strategies to manage the incision and to manage pain, and about signs and symptoms that may indicate complications that should be reported to the primary provider. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of these management strategies, limitations, and recommendations. In addition, the nurse assists the patient in identifying strategies to cope with ADLs (e.g., self-care, child care) and minimize risks to the surgical site (see <a href="c65-sec12.xhtml#ct65-6">Chart&#x00A0;65-6</a>). A discharge educational plan is developed collaboratively by members of the health care team to decrease the risk of recurrent disc herniation. Topics include those previously discussed as well as proper body mechanics, maintenance of optimal weight, proper exercise techniques, and modifications in activity.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The patient is instructed to see the primary provider at prescribed intervals so that the provider can document the disappearance of old symptoms and assess the range of motion of the neck. Recurrent or persistent pain may occur despite removal of the offending disc or disc fragments. Patients who undergo discectomy usually have consented to surgery after prolonged pain; they have often undergone repeated courses of ineffective conservative management and previous surgeries to relieve the pain. Therefore, the recurrence or persistence of symptoms postoperatively, including pain and sensory deficits, is often discouraging for the patient and family. The patient who experiences recurrence of symptoms requires emotional support and understanding. In addition, the patient is assisted in modifying activities and in considering options for subsequent treatment. The nurse educates the patient and family members about the need to participate in health-promotion and health-screening practices.</p>
