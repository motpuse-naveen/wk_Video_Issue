<p class="nonindent">Arterial insufficiency of the extremities occurs most often in men and is a common cause of disability. The legs are most frequently affected; however, the upper extremities may be involved. The age of onset and the severity are influenced by the type and number of atherosclerotic risk factors (see <a href="c26-sec05.xhtml#ct26-3">Chart 26-3</a>). In PAD, obstructive lesions are predominantly confined to segments of the arterial system extending from the aorta below the renal arteries to the popliteal artery (see <a href="#ff26-9">Fig. 26-9</a>). Distal occlusive disease is frequently seen in patients with diabetes and in older patients (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s971">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The hallmark symptom is intermittent claudication described as aching, cramping, or inducing fatigue or weakness that occurs with some degree of activity or exercise, which is relieved with rest. The pain commonly occurs in muscle groups distal to the area of stenosis or occlusion. As the disease progresses, the patient may have a decreased ability to walk the same distance as before or may notice increased pain with ambulation. When the arterial insufficiency becomes severe, the patient has rest pain. This pain is associated with critical ischemia of the distal extremity and is described as persistent, aching, or boring; it may be so excruciating that it is unrelieved by opioids and can be disabling. Ischemic rest pain is usually worse at night and often wakes the patient. Elevating the extremity or placing it in a horizontal position increases the pain, whereas placing the extremity in a dependent position reduces the pain. In an attempt to prevent or relieve the pain, some patients sleep with the affected leg hanging over the side of the bed or sleep in a reclining chair.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s972">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A sensation of coldness or numbness in the extremities may accompany intermittent claudication and is a result of reduced arterial flow. The extremity is cool and pale when elevated or ruddy and cyanotic when placed in a dependent position. Skin and nail changes, ulceration, gangrene, and muscle atrophy may be evident. Bruits may be auscultated with a stethoscope. Peripheral pulses may be diminished or absent.</p>
<p class="indent">Examination of the peripheral pulses is an important part of assessing PAD. Unequal pulses between extremities or the absence of a normally palpable pulse is a sign of PAD.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence, location, and extent of PAD are determined by a careful history of the symptoms and by physical examination. The color and temperature of the extremity are noted and the pulses palpated. The nails may be thickened and opaque, and the skin may be shiny, atrophic, and dry, with sparse or absent hair. The assessment includes comparison of the right and left extremities.</p>
<p class="indent">The diagnosis of PAD may be made using CW Doppler and ABIs, treadmill testing for claudication, duplex ultrasonography, or other imaging studies described earlier in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s973">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Generally, patients feel better and have fewer symptoms of claudication after they participate in a SET program. SET programs are covered by insurance for a specific number of sessions. Reimbursement requires that SET is administered under direct provider supervision. A provider (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, physician assistant) must be immediately and physically available, although not necessarily physically present, while SET is provided. The person providing the program supervision must be trained in the optimal delivery of SET and in both basic life support and advanced cardiac life support techniques. Unsupervised walking exercise programs are attractive for many patients with PAD with limited access to a SET program. Two recent trials in patients with PAD had similar findings between the supervised and unsupervised groups, suggesting no greater therapeutic benefit for those who engage in supervised walking programs (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">McDermott, 2018</a>). These findings suggest that home-based programs may be a viable and efficacious option for patients unable to participate in a structured, on-site, supervised exercise program. If a walking program is combined with weight reduction and cessation of nicotine use, patients often can further improve their activity tolerance. Patients should not be promised that their symptoms will be relieved if they stop nicotine use, however, because claudication may persist, and they may lose their motivation to stop using nicotine. In addition to these interventions, arm-ergometer exercise training effectively improves physical fitness, central cardiorespiratory function, and walking capacity in patients with claudication (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1973">Treat-Jacobson, McDermott, Beckman, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cilostazol is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of claudication. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is a direct vasodilator that inhibits platelet aggregation. Studies have shown it plays a role in decreasing intimal hyperplasia after angioplasty and stenting. Furthermore, patients prescribed cilostazol report improvement in maximal walking distance and pain-free walking distance within 4 to 6 weeks (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1930">Farkas, J&#x00E1;rai, &#x0026; Kolossv&#x00E1;ry, 2017</a>). This agent is contraindicated in patients with a history of heart failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, prevent the formation of thromboemboli which can lead to myocardial infarction and stroke and are recommended to treat patients with symptomatic PAD (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>). Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death) in patients with vascular disease; however, adverse events associated with aspirin use include gastrointestinal upset or bleeding (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Use of dual antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, in patients with symptomatic PAD has not been well established. However, dual antiplatelet agents may be effective and may be reasonable to reduce limb-threatening events after revascularization. Statins improve endothelial function in patients with PAD. Studies suggest that statins reduce severity of intermittent claudication and increase walking distance to the onset of claudication (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>). These medications have beneficial effects on vascular inflammation, plaque stabilization, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis, and have been linked to decreased rates of repeat peripheral interventions, amputations, and major adverse cardiovascular events up to 3 years post procedure (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Saxon, Safley, &#x0026; Mena-Hurtado, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endovascular Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Endovascular interventions can include a balloon angioplasty, stent, stent graft, or an atherectomy. These revascularization procedures are less invasive than conventional surgery; their objective is to establish adequate inflow to the distal vessels. A meta-analysis reported that the efficacy and safety of all of these endovascular procedures are comparable to surgical interventions. Some stents that may be selected are drug eluting. Although costly, these are particularly efficacious in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page836" title="836"></span>patients who have recurrent disease. By releasing antiproliferative drugs, drug-eluting balloons and stents have been shown to reduce the risk of restenosis. Eligible candidates for drug-eluting stents must be able to take antiplatelet medications for at least 6 months post procedure (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is reserved for the treatment of rest pain, severe and disabling claudication, or when the limb is at risk for amputation because of tissue necrosis. The choice of the surgical procedure depends on the degree, length, and location of the stenosis or occlusion and whether there are single or multiple lesions. Other important considerations are the overall health of the patient, the length of the procedure, and anesthesia required. If endarterectomy is performed, an incision is made into the artery and the atheromatous obstruction is removed (see <a href="#ff26-10">Fig. 26-10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bypass grafts are performed to reroute the blood flow around the stenosis or occlusion. Before bypass grafting, the surgeon determines where the distal <strong>anastomosis</strong> (site where the vessels are surgically joined) will be placed. The distal outflow vessel must be at least 50% patent for the graft to remain open. If the atherosclerotic occlusion is below the inguinal ligament in the superficial femoral artery, the surgical procedure of choice is the femoral-to-popliteal graft. This procedure is further classified as above- and below-knee grafts, referring to the location of the distal anastomosis. Bypass grafts may be synthetic materials or autologous vein. Several synthetic materials are available for use as a peripheral bypass graft: woven or knitted Dacron or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Cryopreserved saphenous veins and umbilical veins are also available. When using an autologous conduit (i.e., the patient&#x2019;s own veins), the vein is either grafted to the artery in situ (the vein remains in place with the valves stripped and the vein is anastomosed to the proximal and distal target arteries), or the vein is harvested, reversed, and anastomosed to the proximal and distal target arteries.</p>
<p class="indent">Lower leg or ankle vessels with occlusions may also require grafts. Occasionally, the popliteal artery is completely occluded and only collateral vessels maintain perfusion. The distal anastomosis may be made onto any of the tibial arteries (posterior tibial, anterior tibial, or peroneal arteries) or the dorsalis pedis or plantar artery. The distal anastomosis site is determined by the ease of exposure of the vessel in surgery and by which vessel provides the best flow to the distal limb. These grafts require the use of an autologous vein to ensure patency. The greater or lesser saphenous vein or a combination of one of the saphenous veins and an upper extremity vein such as the cephalic vein is used to provide the required length.</p>
<p class="indent">How long the graft remains patent is determined by several factors, including the size of the graft, graft location, and development of intimal hyperplasia at anastomosis sites (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). Infection of synthetic grafts may result in sepsis and almost always requires removal.</p>
<p class="indent">If a vein graft is the surgical choice, care must be taken in the operating room not to damage the vein after harvesting (removing the vein from the patient&#x2019;s body). The vein is occluded at one end and inflated with a heparinized solution to check for leakage and competency. The graft is then placed in a heparinized solution to keep it from becoming dry and brittle until use during the operative procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who cannot tolerate an extensive vascular surgical procedure, a palliative approach involving primary amputation rather than an endarterectomy or bypass may be considered (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Conte et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s974">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care for patients with PAD is reviewed in <a href="c26-sec05.xhtml#ct26-4">Chart 26-4</a>. Nursing care for the patient who has had endovascular revascularization procedures mostly mirrors the care of patients who have had endovascular repair to aortic aneurysms (see later section). The patient who has had an endovascular procedure may be discharged home the day of the procedure, or by the following day.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="mac1">Nursing Care of the Postoperative Patient</h3>
<p class="nonindent">During the postoperative period, the nurse&#x2019;s care focuses on maintaining circulation, identifying and managing potential complications, and discharge planning.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Circulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The primary objective in the postoperative period is to maintain adequate circulation through the arterial repair. Pulses, Doppler assessment, color and temperature, capillary refill, and sensory and motor function of the affected extremity are checked and compared with those of the other extremity; these observations are recorded initially every 15 minutes and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page837" title="837"></span>then at progressively longer intervals if the patient&#x2019;s status remains stable. Doppler evaluation of the vessels distal to the bypass graft should be performed, because it is more sensitive than palpation for pulses. The ABI is monitored at least once every 8 hours for the first 24 hours (not usually assessed with pedal artery bypasses due to the risk of compression of the anastomosis by the cuff) and then once each day until discharge; the typical hospital length of stay is 3 to 5 days. An adequate circulating blood volume should be established and maintained. Disappearance of a pulse that was present may indicate thrombotic occlusion of the graft; the surgeon is immediately notified.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Continuous monitoring of urine output, central venous pressure, mental status, and pulse rate and volume permits early recognition and treatment of fluid imbalances. Bleeding can result from the heparin given during surgery or from an anastomotic leak. A hematoma may form as well. The nurse should review the operative report to determine if the heparin was reversed (usually with protamine sulfate) in the operating room.</p>
<p class="indent">Leg crossing and prolonged extremity dependency are avoided to prevent thrombosis. Edema is a normal postoperative finding due to increased arterial flow; however, elevating the extremities and encouraging the patient to exercise the extremities while in bed reduces edema. Graduated compression or anti-embolism stockings may be prescribed for some patients, but care must be taken to avoid compressing distal vessel bypass grafts, inducing pressure injuries, and obscuring visualization of the extremity. Severe edema of the extremity, pain, and decreased sensation of toes or fingers can be an indication of compartment syndrome (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Discharge planning includes assessing the patient&#x2019;s ability to manage activities of daily living (ADLs) independently. The nurse determines whether the patient has a network of family and friends to assist with ADLs. The patient is encouraged to make the lifestyle changes necessitated by the onset of disease, including pain management and modifications in diet, activity, and hygiene (skin care). The nurse ensures that the patient has the knowledge and ability to assess for any postoperative complications such as infection, occlusion of the artery or graft, and decreased blood flow. The nurse assists the patient in developing and implementing a plan to stop using tobacco products.</p>
