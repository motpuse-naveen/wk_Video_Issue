<h4 class="h4" id="s745">Pneumothorax</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pneumothorax occurs when the parietal or visceral pleura is breached and the pleural space is exposed to positive atmospheric pressure. Normally, the pressure in the pleural space is negative or subatmospheric; this negative pressure is required to maintain lung inflation. When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, and the lung or a portion of it collapses.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s746">Types of Pneumothorax</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Types of pneumothorax include simple, traumatic, and tension pneumothorax.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Simple Pneumothorax</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A simple, or spontaneous, pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space through a breach of either the parietal or visceral pleura. Most commonly, this occurs as air enters the pleural space through the rupture of a bleb or a bronchopleural fistula. A spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in an apparently healthy person in the absence of trauma due to rupture of an air-filled bleb, or blister, on the surface of the lung, allowing air from the airways to enter the pleural cavity. It may be associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease and severe emphysema.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Traumatic Pneumothorax</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air escapes from a laceration in the lung itself and enters the pleural space or from a wound in the chest wall. It may result from blunt trauma (e.g., rib fractures), penetrating chest or abdominal trauma (e.g., stab wounds or gunshot wounds), or diaphragmatic tears. Traumatic pneumothorax may occur during invasive thoracic procedures (i.e., thoracentesis, transbronchial lung biopsy, and insertion of a subclavian line) in which the pleura is inadvertently punctured, or with barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">A traumatic pneumothorax resulting from major injury to the chest is often accompanied by hemothorax (collection of blood in the pleural space resulting from torn intercostal vessels, lacerations of the great vessels, or lacerations of the lungs). Hemopneumothorax (both blood and air in the chest cavity) is also common after major trauma. Chest surgery can be classified as a traumatic pneumothorax as a result of the entry into the pleural space and the accumulation of air and fluid in the pleural space.</p>
<p class="indent">Open pneumothorax is one form of traumatic pneumothorax. It occurs when a wound in the chest wall is large enough to allow air to pass freely in and out of the thoracic cavity with each attempted respiration. Because the rush of air through the wound in the chest wall produces a sucking sound, such injuries are termed <em>sucking chest wounds.</em> In such patients, not only does the lung collapse, but the structures of the mediastinum (heart and great vessels) also shift toward the uninjured side with each inspiration and in the opposite direction with expiration. This is termed <em>mediastinal flutter</em> or <em>swing,</em> and it produces serious circulatory problems.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Traumatic open pneumothorax calls for emergency interventions. Stopping the flow of air through the opening in the chest wall is a lifesaving measure.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Tension Pneumothorax</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tension pneumothorax:&lt;/b&gt; pneumothorax characterized by increasing positive pressure in the pleural space with each breath; this is an emergency situation, and the positive pressure needs to be decompressed or released immediately">tension pneumothorax</button></strong> occurs when air is drawn into the pleural space from a lacerated lung or through a small opening or wound in the chest wall. It may be a complication of other types of pneumothorax. In contrast to open pneumothorax, the air that enters the chest cavity with each inspiration is trapped; it cannot be expelled during expiration through the air passages or the opening in the chest wall. In effect, a one-way valve or ball valve mechanism occurs where air enters the pleural space but cannot escape. With each breath, tension (positive pressure) is increased within the affected pleural space. This causes the lung to collapse and the heart, the great vessels, and the trachea to shift toward the unaffected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page594" title="594"></span>side of the chest (mediastinal shift). Both respiration and circulatory function are compromised because of the increased intrathoracic pressure, which decreases venous return to the heart, causing decreased cardiac output and impairment of peripheral circulation. In extreme cases, the pulse may be undetectable&#x2014;this is known as pulseless electrical activity.</p>

<img src="images/ff19-13.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff19-13.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;19-13 &#x2022;</span> Open pneumothorax (<strong>top</strong>) and tension pneumothorax (<strong>bottom</strong>). In open pneumothorax, air enters the chest during inspiration and exits during expiration. A slight shift of the affected lung may occur because of a decrease in pressure as air moves out of the chest. In tension pneumothorax, air enters but cannot leave the chest. As the pressure increases, the heart and great vessels are compressed and the mediastinal structures are shifted toward the opposite side of the chest. The trachea is pushed from its normal midline position toward the opposite side of the chest, and the unaffected lung is compressed.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s747">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The signs and symptoms associated with pneumothorax depend on its size and cause. Pain is usually sudden and may be pleuritic. The patient may have only minimal respiratory distress with slight chest discomfort and tachypnea with a small simple or uncomplicated pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large and the lung collapses totally, acute respiratory distress occurs. The patient is anxious, has dyspnea and air hunger, has increased use of the accessory muscles, and may develop central cyanosis from severe hypoxemia.</p>
<p class="indent">In assessing the chest for any type of pneumothorax, the nurse assesses tracheal alignment, expansion of the chest, breath sounds, and percussion of the chest. In a simple pneumothorax, the trachea is midline, expansion of the chest is decreased, breath sounds may be diminished or absent, and percussion of the chest may reveal normal sounds or hyperresonance depending on the size of the pneumothorax. In a tension pneumothorax, the trachea is shifted away from the affected side, chest expansion may be decreased or fixed in a hyperexpansion state, breath sounds are diminished or absent, and percussion to the affected side is hyperresonant. The clinical picture is one of air hunger, agitation, increasing hypoxemia, central cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and profuse diaphoresis. <a href="#ff19-13">Figure&#x00A0;19-13</a> compares open and tension pneumothorax.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s748">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of pneumothorax depends on its cause and severity. The goal of treatment is to evacuate the air or blood from the pleural space. A small chest tube (28 Fr) is inserted near the second intercostal space; this space is used because it is the thinnest part of the chest wall, minimizes the danger of contacting the thoracic nerve, and leaves a less visible scar. If a patient also has a hemothorax, a large-diameter chest tube (32 Fr or greater) is inserted, usually in the fourth or fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line. The tube is directed posteriorly to drain the fluid and air. Once the chest tube or tubes are inserted and suction is applied (usually to 20 mm Hg suction), effective decompression of the pleural cavity (drainage of blood or air) occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">If an excessive amount of blood enters the chest tube in a relatively short period, an autotransfusion may be needed. This technique involves taking the patient&#x2019;s own blood that has been drained from the chest, filtering it, and then transfusing it back into the vascular system.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 594</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page595" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="595">p. 595</span></div>
<p class="indent">In such an emergency, anything may be used that is large enough to fill the chest wound&#x2014;a towel, a handkerchief, or the heel of the hand. If conscious, the patient is instructed to inhale and strain against a closed glottis. This action assists in re-expanding the lung and ejecting the air from the thorax. In the hospital, the opening is plugged by sealing it with gauze impregnated with petrolatum. A pressure dressing is applied. Usually, a chest tube connected to water-seal drainage is inserted to remove air and fluid. Antibiotics usually are prescribed to combat infection from contamination.</p>
<p class="indent">The severity of open pneumothorax depends on the amount and rate of thoracic bleeding and the amount of air in the pleural space. The pleural cavity can be decompressed by thoracentesis or by chest tube drainage of the blood or air. The lung is then able to re-expand and resume the function of gas exchange. As a rule of thumb, thoracotomy is performed if more than 1500 mL of blood is aspirated initially by thoracentesis (or is the initial chest tube output) or if chest tube output continues at greater than 200 mL/h (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Shahani, 2017</a>). The urgency with which the blood must be removed is determined by the degree of respiratory compromise. An emergency thoracotomy may also be performed in the emergency department if a cardiovascular injury secondary to chest or penetrating trauma is suspected. The patient with a possible tension pneumothorax should immediately be given a high concentration of supplemental oxygen to treat the hypoxemia, and pulse oximetry should be used to monitor oxygen saturation. In an emergency situation, a tension pneumothorax can be decompressed or quickly converted to a simple pneumothorax by inserting a large-bore needle (14 gauge) at the second intercostal space, midclavicular line on the affected side. This relieves the pressure and vents the positive pressure to the external environment. A chest tube is then inserted and connected to suction to remove the remaining air and fluid, reestablish the negative pressure, and re-expand the lung. If the lung re-expands and air leakage from the lung parenchyma stops, further drainage may be unnecessary. If a prolonged air leak continues despite chest tube drainage to underwater seal, surgery may be necessary to close the leak.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chest Drainage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chest tubes and a closed drainage system are used to re-expand the involved lung and to remove excess air, fluid, and blood, and may be used in patients who have had a thoracotomy (see previous discussion). Chest drainage systems also are frequently indicated in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax and trauma resulting in pneumothorax. <a href="#tt19-8">Table&#x00A0;19-8</a> describes and compares the main features of these systems.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box595"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for setting up and managing chest drainage systems, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The normal breathing mechanism operates on the principle of negative pressure. The pressure in the chest cavity normally is lower than the pressure of the atmosphere, causing air to move into the lungs during inspiration. Whenever the chest is opened, there is a loss of negative pressure, which results in collapse of the lung. The collection of air, fluid, or other substances in the chest can compromise cardiopulmonary function and can also cause the lung to collapse. Pathologic substances that can collect in the pleural space include fibrin or clotted blood, liquids (serous fluids, blood, pus, chyle), and gases (air from the lung, tracheobronchial tree, or esophagus).</p>
<p class="indent">Chest tubes may be inserted to drain fluid or air from any of the three compartments of the thorax (the right and left pleural spaces and the mediastinum). The pleural space, located between the visceral and parietal pleura, normally contains 20 mL or less of fluid, which helps lubricate the visceral and parietal pleura (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of chest tubes: small-bore and large-bore catheters. Small-bore catheters (7 Fr to 12 Fr) have a one-way valve apparatus to prevent air from moving back into the chest. They can be inserted through a small skin incision. Large-bore catheters, which range in size up to 40 Fr, are usually connected to a chest drainage system to collect any <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page596" title="596"></span>pleural fluid and monitor for air leaks. After the chest tube is positioned, it is sutured to the skin and connected to a drainage apparatus to remove the residual air and fluid from the pleural or mediastinal space. This results in the re-expansion of remaining lung tissue.</p>

<p class="h7">Chest Drainage Systems</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Chest drainage systems</strong> have a suction source, a collection chamber for pleural drainage, and a mechanism to prevent air from reentering the chest with inhalation (see <a href="#ff19-14">Fig.&#x00A0;19-14</a>). Various types of chest drainage systems are available for use in the removal of air and fluid from the pleural space and re-expansion of the lungs. Chest drainage systems come with either wet (water seal) or dry suction control. In wet suction systems, the amount of suction is determined by the amount of water instilled in the suction chamber. The amount of bubbling in the suction chamber indicates the strength of the suction. Wet systems use a water seal to prevent air from moving back into the chest on inspiration. Dry systems use a one-way valve and may have a suction control dial in place of the water. Both systems can operate by gravity drainage, without a suction source.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When the wall vacuum is turned off, the drainage system must be open to the atmosphere so that intrapleural air can escape from the system. This can be done by detaching the tubing from the suction port to provide a vent.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h8">Water-Seal Systems</p>
<p class="nonindent">The traditional water-seal system (or wet suction) for chest drainage has three chambers: a collection chamber, a water-seal chamber, and a wet suction control chamber. The collection chamber acts as a reservoir for fluid draining from the chest tube. It is graduated to permit easy measurement of drainage. Suction may be added to create negative pressure and promote drainage of fluid and removal of air. The suction control chamber regulates the amount of negative pressure applied to the chest. The amount of suction is determined by the water level. It is usually set at 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; adding more fluid results in more suction. After the suction is turned on, bubbling appears in the suction chamber. A positive-pressure valve is located at the top of the suction chamber that automatically opens with increases in positive pressure within the system. Air is automatically released through a positive-pressure relief valve if the suction tubing is inadvertently clamped or kinked.</p>
<p class="indent">The water-seal chamber has a one-way valve or water seal that prevents air from moving back into the chest when the patient inhales. There is an increase in the water level with inspiration and a return to the baseline level during exhalation; this is referred to as tidaling. Intermittent bubbling in the water-seal chamber is normal, but continuous bubbling can indicate an air leak. Bubbling and tidaling do not occur when the tube is placed in the mediastinal space; however, fluid may pulsate with the patient&#x2019;s heartbeat. If the chest tube is connected to gravity drainage only, suction is not used. The pressure is equal to the water seal only. Two-chamber chest drainage systems (water-seal chamber and collection chamber) are available for use with patients who need only gravity drainage.</p>
<p class="indent">The water level in the water-seal chamber reflects the negative pressure present in the intrathoracic cavity. A rise in the water level indicates negative pressure in the pleural or mediastinal space. Excessive negative pressure can cause trauma to tissue. Most chest drainage systems have an automatic means to prevent excessive negative pressure. By pressing and holding a manual high-negativity vent (usually located on the top of the chest drainage system) until the water level in the water-seal chamber returns to the 2-cm mark, excessive negative pressure is avoided, preventing damage to tissue.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 596</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page597" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="597">p. 597</span></div>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>If the chest tube and drainage system become disconnected, air can enter the pleural space, producing a pneumothorax. To prevent pneumothorax if the chest tube is inadvertently disconnected from the drainage system, a temporary water seal can be established by immersing the chest tube&#x2019;s open end in a bottle of sterile water.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h8">Dry Suction Water-Seal Systems</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dry suction water-seal systems, also referred to as dry suction, have a collection chamber for drainage, a water-seal chamber, and a dry suction control regulator. The water-seal chamber is filled with water to the 2-cm level. Bubbling in this area can indicate an air leak. The dry suction control regulator provides a dial that conveniently regulates vacuum to the chest drain. The system does not contain a suction control chamber filled with water. Without a water-filled suction chamber, the machine is quieter. However, if the container is knocked over, the water seal may be lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the tube is connected to the suction source, the regulator dial allows the desired level of suction to be set; the suction is increased until an indicator appears. The indicator has the same function as the bubbling in the traditional water-seal system&#x2014;that is, it indicates that the vacuum is adequate to maintain the desired level of suction. Some drainage systems use a bellows (a chamber that can be expanded or contracted) or an orange-colored float device as an indicator of when the suction control regulator is set.</p>
<p class="indent">When the water in the water seal rises above the 2-cm level, intrathoracic pressure increases. Dry suction water-seal systems have a manual high-negativity vent located on top of the drain. The manual high-negativity vent is pressed until the indicator appears (either a float device or bellows) and the water level in the water seal returns to the desired level, indicating that the intrathoracic pressure is decreased.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The manual vent should not be used to lower the water level in the water seal when the patient is on gravity drainage (no suction) because intrathoracic pressure is equal to the pressure in the water seal.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h8">Dry Suction Systems with a One-Way Valve</p>
<p class="nonindent">A third type of chest drainage system is dry suction with a one-way mechanical valve. This system has a collection chamber, a one-way mechanical valve, and a dry suction control chamber. The valve permits air and fluid to leave the chest but prevents their movement back into the pleural space. This model lacks a water-seal chamber and therefore can be set up quickly in emergency situations, and the dry control drain still works even if it is knocked over. This makes the dry suction systems useful for the patient who is ambulating or being transported. However, without the water-seal chamber, there is no way to tell by inspection whether the pressure in the chest has changed, even though an air leak indicator is present so that the system can be checked. If an air leak is suspected, 30 mL of water is injected into the air leak indicator or the container is tipped so that fluid enters the air leak detection chamber. Bubbles will appear if a leak is present.</p>

<p class="indent">If the chest tube has been inserted to re-expand a lung after pneumothorax, or if very little fluid drainage is expected, a one-way valve (Heimlich valve) may be connected to the chest tube. This valve may be attached to a collection bag (see <a href="#ff19-15">Fig.&#x00A0;19-15</a>) or covered with a sterile dressing if no drainage is expected.</p>
