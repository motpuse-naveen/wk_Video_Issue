<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">absorption:</span> phase of the digestive process that occurs when small molecules, vitamins, and minerals pass through the walls of the small and large intestine and into the bloodstream</p>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">anus:</span> last section of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; outlet for waste products from the GI system</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">chyme:</span> mixture of food with saliva, salivary enzymes, and gastric secretions that is produced as food passes through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">digestion:</span> phase of the digestive process that occurs when digestive enzymes and secretions mix with ingested food and when proteins, fats, and sugars are broken down into their component smaller molecules</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">dyspepsia:</span> indigestion; upper abdominal discomfort associated with eating</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">elimination:</span> phase of the digestive process that occurs after digestion and absorption, when waste products are evacuated from the body</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">esophagus:</span> collapsible tube connecting the mouth to the stomach, through which food passes as it is ingested</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hydrochloric acid:</span> acid secreted by the glands in the stomach; mixes with chyme to break it down into absorbable molecules and to aid in the destruction of bacteria</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">ingestion:</span> phase of the digestive process that occurs when food is taken into the GI tract via the mouth and esophagus</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">intrinsic factor:</span> a gastric secretion that combines with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> so that the vitamin can be absorbed</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">large intestine:</span> the portion of the GI tract into which waste material from the small intestine passes as absorption continues and elimination begins; consists of several parts&#x2014;ascending segment, transverse segment, descending segment, sigmoid colon, and rectum (<em>synonym:</em> colon)</p>

<p class="nonindent">Abnormalities of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are numerous and represent every type of major pathology that can affect other organ systems, including bleeding, perforation, obstruction, inflammation, and cancer. Congenital, inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, and neoplastic lesions have been encountered in every portion and at every site along the length of the GI tract. As with all other organ systems, the GI tract is subject to circulatory disturbances, faulty nervous system control, and aging.</p>
<p class="indent">Apart from the many organic diseases to which the GI tract is susceptible, many extrinsic factors can interfere with its normal function and produce symptoms. Stress and anxiety, for example, often find their chief expression in indigestion, anorexia, or motor disturbances of the intestines, sometimes producing constipation or diarrhea. In addition, factors such as fatigue and an inadequate or abruptly changed dietary intake can markedly affect the GI tract. When assessing and educating the patient, the nurse should consider the variety of mental and physical factors that affect the function of the GI tract.</p>
