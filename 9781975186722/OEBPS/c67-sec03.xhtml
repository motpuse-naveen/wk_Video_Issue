<h4 class="h4" id="s3185">Limiting Exposure to Health Risks</h4>
<p class="nonindent">ED staff are at an increased risk for exposure to communicable diseases through blood, respiratory droplets, or other body fluids. This risk for exposure to any communicable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2181" title="2181"></span>disease is further compounded because of the common use of a multitude of invasive treatments for patients in the ED (e.g., suturing, wound d&#x00E9;bridement, aerosol generating procedures). This increased risk had been apparent for many years because of increasing numbers of people infected with hepatitis, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and tuberculosis; however, these risks became magnified because of concerns of infecting ED staff with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); see following discussion.</p>
<p class="indent">The potential for exposure to highly contagious organisms, hazardous chemicals or gases, and radiation related to acts of terrorism or natural or human-engineered disasters presents additional risks to ED staff. See <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a> for information about decontamination procedures.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3186"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtv1.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, all emergency health care providers must adhere strictly to standard precautions for minimizing exposure, because not all patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are symptomatic. Universal screening measures should be implemented upon arrival to the ED for all ED staff, patients, and visitors/family members (assuming that their presence in the ED is not prohibited). Patients and visitors/family members should wear their own mask or face coverings as tolerated, and if they do not have them, they should be provided upon their arrival to the ED. ED staff should wear facemasks at all times while in the hospital. In general, cloth masks, bandanas, and scarves are not considered suitable masks for use by health care workers (ENA, 2020b). Health care workers, patients, and visitors all need to be educated on the importance of hand hygiene and social distancing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">The ENA (2020b) issued a statement that all emergency nurses providing direct care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must be provided the appropriate level of personal protective equipment (PPE) to safely care for these patients. The PPE provided to emergency nurses in this situation should meet standards set by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for further discussion of PPE); N95 respirators, which include a facemask that seals firmly to the face and that filters at least 95% of airborne particles, are recommended over other less effective masks or face coverings (CDC, 2020b).</p>
