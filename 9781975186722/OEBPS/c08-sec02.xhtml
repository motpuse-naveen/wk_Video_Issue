<h4 class="h4" id="s150">Age-Related Changes</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The well-being of older adults depends on physical, psychosocial, mental, social, economic, and environmental factors. A total assessment includes an evaluation of all major body systems, social and mental status, the person&#x2019;s ability to function independently, and their quality of life.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s151">Physical Aspects of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Intrinsic aging (from within the person) refers to those changes caused by the normal aging process that are genetically programmed and essentially universal within a species. Universality is the major criterion used to distinguish normal aging from pathologic changes associated with illness. However, people age quite differently and at different rates; thus, chronologic age is often less predictive of obvious age characteristics than other factors, such as one&#x2019;s genetics (see <a href="#ct8-1">Chart&#x00A0;8-1</a>) and lifestyle factors (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Frishman, 2019</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib577">Seah, Kowitlawakul, Jiang, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Sommerlad et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cellular and extracellular changes that occur with aging cause functional decline and measurable changes in physical appearance, including changes in shape and body makeup. Cellular aging and tissue deficits also diminish the body&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page169" title="169"></span>ability to maintain homeostasis and prevent organ systems from functioning at full efficiency. As cells become less able to replace themselves, they accumulate a pigment known as lipofuscin. A degradation of elastin and collagen causes connective tissue to become stiffer and less elastic. These changes result in diminished capacity for organ function and increased vulnerability to disease and stress. Age-related changes in the hematopoietic system influence red blood cell production, leading to increased rates of anemia (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="#tt8-1">Table&#x00A0;8-1</a> summarizes subjective and objective findings related to age-related changes in the body systems. More in-depth information about age-related changes can be found in the chapters pertaining to each organ system.</p>
<p class="indent">When assessing the physical aspects of aging, nurses should know that tactile sensation is reduced and changes in the ability to sense pressure, pain, and temperature all lead to a decreased ability to identify and attend to physical symptoms (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Kennedy-Malone, Martin-Plank, &#x0026; Duffy, 2019</a>)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiovascular System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Heart disease is the leading cause of death in older adults. Age-related changes reduce the efficiency of the heart and contribute to decreased compliance of the heart muscle. These changes include myocardial hypertrophy, which changes left ventricular strength and function; increased fibrosis and calcified tissues that infiltrate muscles and conductive tissues causing stenosis of the valves; and decreased pacemaker cells. As a result, the heart valves become thicker and stiffer, and the heart muscle and arteries lose their elasticity, resulting in a reduced stroke volume. Calcium and fat deposits accumulate within arterial walls, and veins become increasingly stiff and tortuous, increasing arterial resistance; this leads to hypertension and increases the workload of the heart (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Capriotti &#x0026; Frizzell, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is difficult to differentiate between age- and disease-related changes in cardiovascular function because of the significant influence of behavioral factors on cardiovascular health. When cross-cultural studies are conducted, cardiovascular changes that in the past were thought to be age related do not consistently appear. For example, the higher blood pressure found in older adults in Western societies does not occur in less-developed societies and may be a result of different lifestyle behaviors rather than normal age-related changes (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). The cardiovascular system can adapt to many normal age-related changes and often an older person is unaware of any significant decline in cardiovascular performance. However, when challenged, for instance, during exercise or stress, the cardiovascular system of an older person is less efficient and may be unable to respond sufficiently when life-sustaining activities are needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Careful assessment of older adults is necessary because they often present with different symptoms than those seen in younger patients. Older adults are more likely to have dyspnea or neurologic symptoms associated with heart disease, and they may experience mental status changes or report vague symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and syncope. Rather than the typical substernal chest pain associated with myocardial ischemia, older patients may report burning or sharp pain or discomfort in an area of the upper body. Complicating the assessment is the fact that many older patients have more than one underlying disease. When a patient complains of symptoms related to digestion and breathing and upper extremity pain, cardiac disease must be considered. The absence of chest pain in an older patient is not a reliable indicator of the absence of heart disease.</p>

<p class="indent">Orthostatic and postprandial hypotension may be a concern as well because of decreased baroreflex sensitivity and risk factors such as medications (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). Therefore, it is important to assess blood pressure in two positions. A patient experiencing hypotension should be counseled to rise slowly (from a lying, to a sitting, to a standing position), avoid straining when having a bowel movement, and consider having five or six small meals each day, rather than three, to minimize the hypotension that can occur after a large meal. Extremes in temperature, including hot showers and whirlpool baths, should be avoided.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Respiratory System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The respiratory system compensates well for the functional changes of aging. In general, healthy, nonsmoking older adults show very little decline in respiratory function; however, there are substantial individual variations and aerobic capacity declines with each decade by about 10% from peak performance in the early to mid-20s (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Capriotti &#x0026; Frizzell, 2016</a>). The age-related changes that do occur are subtle and gradual, and healthy older adults are able to compensate for these changes. Diminished respiratory efficiency and reduced maximal inspiratory and expiratory force may occur as a result of calcification and weakening of the muscles of the chest wall. Lung mass decreases and residual volume increases (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Conditions of stress, such as illness, may increase the demand for oxygen and affect the overall function of other systems. Like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases manifest more subtly in older adults than in younger adults and do not necessarily follow the typical pattern of cough, chills, and fever. Older adults may exhibit fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, dehydration, and mental status changes (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Smoking is the most significant risk factor for respiratory diseases and older adults have a higher rate of smoking, about 20%, compared to the national average of 18% (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib553">Bowler, Hansel, Jacobson, et al., 2017</a>). Therefore, a major focus of health promotion activities should be on smoking cessation and avoidance of environmental smoke. Despite marketing by manufacturers, e-cigarettes are not an effective smoking cessation aid nor do they promote health (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Bowler et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Additional activities that help older adults maintain adequate respiratory function include regular exercise, appropriate fluid intake, pneumococcal vaccination, yearly influenza immunizations, and avoidance of people who are ill. Hospitalized older adults should be frequently reminded to cough and take deep breaths, particularly postoperatively, because their decreased lung capacity and decreased cough efficiency predispose them to atelectasis and respiratory infections.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Integumentary System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The functions of the skin include protection, temperature regulation, sensation, and excretion. Aging can interrupt all functions of the skin and affect appearance (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Norris, 2019</a>). Epidermal proliferation decreases, and the dermis becomes thinner. Elastic fibers are reduced in number and collagen becomes stiffer. Subcutaneous fat diminishes, particularly in the extremities, and less vasodilation renders the body less able to produce or conserve body heat. These changes lead to lack of fever in circumstances in which fever would normally be present in younger individuals and reduced tolerance to temperature extremes, which increases the likelihood of hypothermia and hyperthermia (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Capriotti &#x0026; Frizzell, 2016</a>). There is also a loss of resiliency with wrinkling and sagging of the skin. The skin becomes drier and more susceptible to burns, injury, and infection. Hair pigmentation may change and balding may occur; genetic factors strongly influence these changes. These changes in the integument reduce tolerance to temperature extremes and sun exposure.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 171</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page172" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="172">p. 172</span></div>
<p class="indent">Lifestyle practices have a large impact on skin changes. Strategies to promote healthy skin function include not smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, avoiding exposure to the sun, using a sun protection factor of 15 or higher, wearing protective clothing, using emollient skin cream containing petrolatum or mineral oil, avoiding hot soaks in the bathtub, and maintaining optimal nutrition and hydration (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Farage, Miller, &#x0026; Maibach, 2017</a>). Older adults should be encouraged to have any changes in the skin examined, because early detection and treatment of precancerous or cancerous lesions are essential for the best outcome.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reproductive System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An outdated perception is that older adults are asexual, but older adults report that a fairly stable and active sex life is an important quality of life issue. Sexual activity declines with the loss of a partner, primarily for women as a result of widowhood and for men as a result of poor heath, poor sleep, erectile dysfunction, medications, and emotional factors. However, although good health is a predictor of sexual activity, older adults with chronic illnesses may be able to have a sexually active life as well. Because of the many factors that influence the ability to be sexually active, nurses and the older person need to understand the physiologic, psychologic, and social factors that affect reproductive and sexual functioning as aging progresses (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib554">Bozorgmehri, Fink, Parimi, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Kennedy-Malone et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone declines with menopause. Changes that occur in the female reproductive system include thinning of the vaginal wall, along with a shortening of the vagina and a loss of elasticity; decreased vaginal secretions, resulting in vaginal dryness, itching, and decreased acidity; involution (atrophy) of the uterus and ovaries; and decreased pubococcygeal muscle tone, resulting in a relaxed vagina and perineum. Without the use of water-soluble lubricants, these changes may contribute to vaginal bleeding and painful penile-vaginal intercourse.</p>
<p class="indent">In older men, the testes become less firm but may continue to produce viable sperm up to 90 years of age. At about 50 years of age, production of testosterone begins to diminish (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Mark, 2017</a>). Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction may develop but are more likely to be associated with factors other than age-related changes. These risk factors include obesity, smoking, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disorders, diabetes, respiratory disease, chronic pain, and many medications (i.e., vasodilators, antihypertensive agents, and tricyclic antidepressants) (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Bozorgmehri et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In both older men and women, it may take longer to become sexually aroused, longer to complete sexual intercourse, and longer before sexual arousal can occur again. Although a less intense response to sexual stimulation and a decline in sexual activity occurs with increasing age, sexual desire does not disappear. Many couples are unaware of the causes of decreased libido or erectile dysfunction and are often reluctant to discuss decreased sexual function. Many nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical methods are available to improve sexual relationships. Assessment and communication require sensitivity and expert knowledge in the field of sexual dysfunction. If sexual dysfunction is present, referral to a gynecologist, urologist, or sex therapist may be warranted.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genitourinary System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The genitourinary system continues to function adequately in older adults, although kidney mass is decreased, primarily because of a loss of nephrons. However, the loss of nephrons does not typically become significant until about 90 years of age, and changes in kidney function vary widely; approximately one third of older adults show no decrease in renal function (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Mark, 2017</a>). Changes in renal function may be attributable to a combination of aging and pathologic conditions such as hypertension. The changes most commonly seen include a decreased filtration rate, diminished tubular function with less efficiency in reabsorbing and concentrating the urine, and a slower restoration of acid&#x2013;base balance in response to stress. In addition, older adults who take medications may experience serious consequences owing to decline in renal function because of impaired absorption, decreased ability to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, and decreased ability to concentrate urine.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain genitourinary disorders are more common in older adults than in the general population. In the United States, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urinary incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; unplanned, involuntary, or uncontrolled loss of urine">urinary incontinence</button></strong> (i.e., unplanned, involuntary, or uncontrolled loss of urine) affects women more than men at a ratio of 2:1 until after age 80, when both are equally affected. This condition should not be mistaken as a normal consequence of aging (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Resnick, 2019</a>). Costly and often embarrassing, it should be evaluated, because in many cases it is reversible or can be treated. When treatable, this condition needs to be addressed as the risk of mortality associated with urinary incontinence can be as high as 44% in patients living in long-term care facilities (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib561">Dami&#x00E1;n, Pator-Barriuso, Garcia L&#x00F3;pez, et al., 2017</a>). See <a href="c49.xhtml">Chapter 49</a> for further discussion of urinary incontinence. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate gland), a common finding in older men, causes a gradual increase in urine retention and overflow incontinence. Changes in the urinary tract increase the susceptibility to urinary tract infections (UTIs). Adequate consumption of fluids is an important nursing intervention that reduces the risk of bladder infections and also helps decrease urinary incontinence.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Digestion of food is less influenced by changes associated with aging than by the risk of poor nutrition. Older adults can adjust to changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) system but may have difficulty purchasing, preparing, and enjoying their meals. The sense of smell diminishes as a result of neurologic changes and environmental factors such as smoking, medications, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiencies. The ability to recognize sweet, sour, bitter, or salty foods diminishes over time, altering satisfaction with food. Salivary flow does not decrease in healthy adults; however, approximately one third of older adults may experience a dry mouth as a result of medications and diseases (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). Difficulties with chewing and swallowing are generally associated with lack of teeth and diseases.</p>
<p class="indent">Experts disagree on the extent of gastric changes that occur as a result of normal aging. However, gastric motility appears to slow modestly, which results in delayed emptying of stomach contents and early satiety (feeling of fullness). Diminished secretion of gastric acid and pepsin, seemingly the result of pathologic conditions rather than normal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page173" title="173"></span>aging, reduces the absorption of iron, calcium, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, particularly calcium and vitamin D, appears to diminish with age. Functions of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are generally maintained, although absorption and tolerance to fat may decrease. The incidence of gallstones and common bile duct stones increases progressively with advancing years.</p>
<p class="indent">Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, increases with age and is a major health care problem in older patients. Normal aging alters some aspects of the swallowing function. In addition, dysphagia is a frequent complication of stroke and a significant risk factor for the development of aspiration pneumonia that can be life-threatening. Dysphagia is caused by interruption or dysfunction of neural pathways. It may also result from dysfunction of the striated and smooth muscles of the GI tract in patients with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. Aspiration of food or fluid is the most serious complication and can occur in the absence of coughing or choking.</p>
<p class="indent">Constipation is a common condition affecting many older adults; it is influenced by multiple risk factors rather than age-related changes alone. Symptoms of mild constipation are abdominal discomfort and flatulence; more serious constipation leads to fecal impaction that contributes to diarrhea around the impaction, fecal incontinence, and obstruction. Predisposing factors for constipation include lack of dietary bulk, prolonged use of laxatives, some medications, inactivity, insufficient fluid intake, and excessive dietary fat. Ignoring the urge to defecate may also be a contributing factor (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Practices that promote GI health include regular tooth brushing and flossing; receiving regular dental care; drinking sufficient fluids; eating small, frequent meals that are high in fiber and low in fat; avoiding heavy activity or lying flat after eating; and avoiding the use of laxatives and antacids. Understanding that there is a direct correlation between loss of smell and taste perception and food intake helps caregivers intervene to maintain the nutritional health of older patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Health</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The social, psychologic, and physiologic functions of eating influence the dietary habits of older adults. Increasing age alters nutrient requirements; older adults require fewer calories and a more nutrient-rich, healthy diet in response to alterations in body mass and a more sedentary lifestyle. Recommendations include reducing fat intake while consuming sufficient protein, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber for health and prevention of disease. Decreased physical activity and a slower metabolic rate reduce the number of calories needed by older adults to maintain an ideal weight. As stated previously, age-related changes that alter pleasure in eating include a decrease in taste and smell. Older adults are likely to require more sugar to achieve a sweet flavor due to blunted taste. They also may lose the ability to differentiate sour, salty, and bitter tastes. Apathy, immobility, depression, loneliness, poverty, inadequate knowledge, and poor oral health also contribute to suboptimal nutrient intake. Budgetary constraints and physical limitations may interfere with food shopping and meal preparation.</p>
<p class="indent">Health promotion for older adults is based on the person&#x2019;s physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual health. The main focus of health promotion is engaging the older adult in improving their health (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Meiner &#x0026; Yeager, 2019</a>). The goals of nutrition therapy are to maintain or restore maximal independent functioning and health and to maintain the sense of dignity and quality of life by imposing as few restrictions as possible. Dietary changes should be incorporated into the older adult&#x2019;s existing food pattern as much as possible. <a href="#ff8-2">Figure&#x00A0;8-2</a> lists modified dietary guidelines for older adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Women older than 50 years and men older than 70 years should have a daily calcium intake of 1200 mg. To foster the absorption of calcium, adults should have 600 IU of vitamin D until 70 years of age and 800 IU after 70 years of age to maintain bone health (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Undernutrition, which can lead to malnutrition, may be a problem for older adults. Hospitalized older adults are at particular risk of malnutrition, especially those with cognitive impairment or dementia (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Tatum, Talebreza, &#x0026; Ross, 2018</a>). A recent unintentional weight loss may be a result of an illness or other factors, such as depression, that may have serious consequences and affect a person&#x2019;s ability to maintain health and fight illness (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Norris, 2019</a>). Many people are unaware of dietary deficits. Nurses are in an ideal position to identify nutritional problems among their patients and to work within the patient&#x2019;s own framework of knowledge of their health status to improve health behaviors. (See <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for more information on nutritional assessment.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sleep</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults have increased complaints about their sleep as they age, and as many as 50% of those living at home and 65% of those living in nursing homes complain of sleep disturbances (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib562">Devlin, Skrobik, Gelinas, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib579">&#x0160;tefan, Vrgo&#x010D;, Rup&#x010D;i&#x0107;, et al., 2018</a>). Many factors affect sleep quality in older adults including respiratory problems during sleep, restless leg syndrome, nocturia, pain, osteoarthritis, heart failure, incontinence, prostatic hyperplasia, menopause-related problems, pruritus, allergies, AD, depression, dementia, social isolation, loneliness, being bedridden, experiences of loss, drug use, and living in nursing homes (e.g., inadequate lighting, keeping light on during the night, noises). Some of the consequences of poor sleep quality in older adults include cognitive decline, increased risk of falls, daytime fatigue, reduced physical and mental health and health-related quality-of-life status, and poor ICU outcomes (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Devlin et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib579">&#x0160;tefan et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The incidence of sleep apnea (a sleep disorder characterized by brief periods in which respirations are absent) increases with age. Having insomnia symptoms and a sleep-related disorder (snoring, choking, or pauses in breathing) is associated with significantly impaired daytime functioning and longer psychomotor reaction times compared with having either condition. Sleep apnea is discussed in more detail in <a href="c18.xhtml">Chapter 18</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse often observes patients while they are sleeping and can identify problems. Health education can be provided on sleep hygiene behaviors such as avoiding use of the bed for activities other than sleeping (or sex), maintaining a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding or limiting daytime napping, and limiting alcohol intake to one drink a day. Additional suggestions include avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine after noon; curbing the amount of liquids in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page174" title="174"></span>evening to avoid nocturia; and engaging in regular physical activity, preferably in bright outside light. Aromatherapy trials have reported that the use of lavender essential oil can improve the quality of sleep (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib569">Karadag, Samancioglu, Ozden, et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Musculoskeletal System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intact musculoskeletal and neurologic systems are essential for the maintenance of safe mobility, performance of <strong>activities of daily living (ADLs)</strong> (basic personal care activities), and <strong>instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)</strong> (complex skills such as shopping, cooking, housework, using the telephone, managing medications and finances, and being able to travel by car or public transportation), thus allowing older adults to remain safe and live independently in the community. Age-related changes that affect mobility include alterations in bone remodeling, leading to decreased bone density, loss of muscle mass, deterioration of muscle fibers and cell membranes, and degeneration in the function and efficiency of joints. These factors are discussed in detail in Unit 8.</p>
<p class="indent">Without exercise, a gradual, progressive decrease in bone mass begins before 40 years of age. The cartilage of joints also progressively deteriorates in middle age. Degenerative joint disease is found in most adults older than 70 years, and weight-bearing joint and back pain is a common complaint. Excessive loss of bone density results in osteoporosis, which leads to potentially life-altering hip and vertebral fractures. Osteoporosis is preventable.</p>
<p class="indent">The axiom &#x201C;use it or lose it&#x201D; is very relevant to the physical capacity of older adults. Nurses play an important role by encouraging older adults to participate in a regular exercise program. The benefits of regular exercise cannot be overstated. Aerobic exercises are the foundation of programs of cardiovascular conditioning; however, resistance and strength training and flexibility exercises are essential components of an exercise program. Even late in life, in adults who may be frail, it is believed that exercise has benefits of increasing strength, aerobic capacity, flexibility, and balance. In addition, older adults who are hospitalized benefit from getting out of bed as soon as possible and in-hospital physical activity.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nervous System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Homeostasis is difficult to maintain with aging, but older people have a tremendous ability to adapt and function adequately, retaining their cognitive and intellectual abilities in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page175" title="175"></span>the absence of pathologic changes. However, normal aging changes in the nervous system can affect all parts of the body. The structure, chemistry, and function of the nervous system change with advanced age. Nerve cells in the brain decrease but the decrease is compensated for by other neurons; there is high variability among individuals and the quantity of neuronal loss varies in different parts of the brain. Overall, the decreases contribute to a small loss of brain mass (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Capriotti &#x0026; Frizzell, 2016</a>). Chemical changes include a decrease in the synthesis and metabolism of the major neurotransmitters. Because nerve impulses are conducted more slowly, older people take longer to respond and react (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). The autonomic nervous system performs less efficiently, and orthostatic hypotension, discussed earlier, may occur. Neurologic changes can affect gait and balance, which may interfere with mobility and safety. Nurses must advise older adults to allow a longer time to respond to a stimulus and to move more deliberately. Adequate nutrition and absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is important for neurologic health. Nurses should advise older adults about proper nutrition and intake of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, especially for older adults who follow a vegetarian diet.</p>
<p class="indent">Slowed reaction time puts older adults at risk for falls and injuries, as well as driving errors. Although older adults spend less time driving than younger people, older adults are just as likely to be involved in motor vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death. Older adults who are suspected of driving unsafely should receive a driving fitness evaluation (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). The evaluation is often performed by an occupational therapist in conjunction with a neuropsychologist, who conducts more detailed cognitive testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Mental function may be threatened by physical or emotional stresses. A sudden onset of confusion may be the first symptom of an infection or change in physical condition (e.g., pneumonia, UTI, medication interactions, dehydration).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sensory System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">People interact with the world through their senses. Losses associated with old age affect all sensory organs, and it can be devastating not to be able to see to read or watch television, hear conversation well enough to communicate, or discriminate taste well enough to enjoy food. Nearly half of older men and one third of older women report difficulty hearing without a hearing aid. Most older adults have a decrease in visual acuity, a narrowing of the visual field, and may have trouble seeing at night. An uncompensated sensory loss negatively affects the functional ability and quality of life of the older adult. However, assistive devices such as visual and hearing aids can compensate for a sensory loss (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Sensory Loss Versus Sensory Deprivation</p>
<p class="nonindent">In contrast to sensory loss, sensory deprivation is the absence of stimuli in the environment or the inability to interpret existing stimuli (perhaps as a result of a sensory loss). Sensory deprivation can lead to boredom, confusion, irritability, disorientation, and anxiety. A decline in sensory input can mimic a decline in cognition that is in fact not present. Meaningful sensory stimulation provided to the older person is often helpful in correcting this problem. In some situations, one sense can substitute for another in observing and interpreting stimuli. Nurses can enhance sensory stimulation in the environment with colors, pictures, textures, tastes, smells, and sounds. The stimuli are most meaningful if they are appropriate for older adults and the stimuli are changed often. Cognitively impaired people tend to respond well to touch and to familiar music.</p>
<p class="h7">Vision</p>
<p class="nonindent">As new cells form on the outside surface of the lens of the eye, the older central cells accumulate and become yellow, rigid, dense, and cloudy, leaving only the outer portion of the lens elastic enough to change shape (accommodate) and focus at near and far distances. As the lens becomes less flexible, the near point of focus gets farther away. This common condition&#x2014;<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;presbyopia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in visual accommodation that occurs with advancing age">presbyopia</button></strong>&#x2014;usually begins in the fifth decade of life and requires the person to wear reading glasses to magnify objects (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). In addition, the yellowing, cloudy lens causes light to scatter and is sensitive to glare. The ability to distinguish colors decreases, particularly blue from green. The pupil dilates slowly and less completely because of increased stiffness of the muscles of the iris, thus the older person takes more time to adjust when going to and from light and dark settings and needs brighter light for close vision. Pathologic visual conditions are not a part of normal aging; however, the incidence of eye disease (most commonly cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) increases in older adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in older adults 65 and older. It is predicted that cases of AMD will double from 48 million to 88 million people by 2050 (CDC, 2017). Macular degeneration does not affect peripheral vision, which means that it does not cause blindness. However, it affects central vision, color perception, and fine detail, greatly affecting common visual skills such as reading, driving, and seeing faces. Risk factors include sunlight exposure, cigarette smoking, and heredity. People with fair skin and blue eyes may be at increased risk. Sunglasses and hats with visors provide some protection, and stopping smoking is paramount in preventing the disease. Although there is no definitive treatment and no cure that restores vision, several treatment options are available, depending on factors such as the location of the abnormal blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy are commonly used (CDC, 2017). The earlier this condition is diagnosed, the greater the chances of preserving sight. See <a href="c58.xhtml">Chapter 58</a> for more information on altered vision.</p>
<p class="h7">Hearing</p>
<p class="nonindent">Auditory changes begin to be noticed at about 40 years of age. Environmental factors, such as exposure to noise, medications, and infections, as well as genetics, may contribute to hearing loss as much as age-related changes. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;presbycusis:&lt;/b&gt; decreased ability to hear high-pitched tones that naturally begins in midlife as a result of irreversible inner ear changes">Presbycusis</button></strong> is a gradual sensorineural loss that progresses from the loss of the ability to hear high-frequency tones to a generalized loss of hearing. It is attributed to irreversible inner ear changes. Older adults often cannot follow conversation because tones of high-frequency consonants (the sounds <em>f, s, th, ch, sh, b, t, p</em>) all sound alike. Hearing loss may cause older adults to respond inappropriately, misunderstand conversation, and avoid social interaction. This behavior may be erroneously interpreted as confusion. Wax buildup or other correctable problems may also be responsible for hearing difficulties. A systematic review reported the prevalence of under detection <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page176" title="176"></span>of hearing loss and the under use of hearing aids in long-term care facilities (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Punch &#x0026; Horstmanshof, 2019</a>). A properly prescribed and fitted hearing aid may be useful in reducing some types of hearing deficits and increasing quality of life (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Punch &#x0026; Horstmanshof, 2019</a>). See <a href="c59.xhtml">Chapter 59</a> for discussion of alterations in hearing.</p>
<p class="h7">Taste and Smell</p>
<p class="nonindent">The senses of taste and smell are reduced in older adults. Of the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter), sweet tastes are particularly dulled in older adults. Blunted taste may contribute to the preference for salty, highly seasoned foods, but herbs, onions, garlic, and lemon can be used as substitutes for salt to flavor food.</p>
<p class="indent">Changes in the sense of smell, generally greater than the loss of taste, are related to cell loss in the nasal passages and in the olfactory bulb in the brain (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Norris, 2019</a>). Environmental factors such as long-term exposure to toxins (e.g., dust, pollen, smoke) contribute to the cellular damage.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s152">Psychosocial Aspects of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Successful psychological aging is reflected in the ability of older adults to adapt to physical, social, and emotional losses and to achieve life satisfaction. Because changes in life patterns are inevitable over a lifetime, older adults need resiliency and coping skills when confronting stresses and change. A positive self-image enhances risk taking and participation in new, untested roles.</p>
<p class="indent">Although attitudes toward older adults differ in ethnic subcultures, a subtle theme of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ageism:&lt;/b&gt; a bias that discriminates, stigmatizes, and disadvantages older adults based solely on their chronologic age">ageism</button></strong>&#x2014;prejudice or discrimination against older adults&#x2014;predominates in society, and many myths surround aging. Ageism is based on stereotypes&#x2014;simplified and often untrue beliefs that reinforce society&#x2019;s negative image of older adults. Although older adults make up an extremely heterogeneous and increasingly a racially and ethnically diverse group, these negative stereotypes are sometimes attributed to all older adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Fear of aging and the inability of many to confront their own aging process may trigger ageist beliefs. Retirement and perceived nonproductivity are also responsible for negative feelings, because a younger working person may falsely see older people as not contributing to society, as draining economic resources, and may actually feel that they are in competition with children for resources. Concern about the large numbers of older people leaving the workforce (baby boomers began to turn 65 years of age in 2010) is fueling this debate.</p>
<p class="indent">Negative images are so common in society that older adults themselves often believe and perpetuate them. An understanding of the aging process and respect for each person as an individual can dispel the myths of aging. Nurses can facilitate successful aging by recommending health promotion strategies such as anticipatory planning for retirement, including ensuring adequate income, developing routines not associated with work, replacing work-related friends with new acquaintances, and relying on other people and groups in addition to spouse to fill leisure time (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Meiner &#x0026; Yeager, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Stress and Coping in the Older Adult</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Coping patterns and the ability to adapt to stress develop over the course of a lifetime and remain consistent later in life. Experiencing success in younger adulthood helps a person develop a positive self-image that remains solid through old age. A person&#x2019;s abilities to adapt to change, make decisions, and respond predictably are also determined by past experiences. A flexible, well-functioning person will probably continue as such. However, losses may accumulate within a short period of time and become acute. The older person often has fewer choices and diminished resources to deal with stressful events. Common stressors of old age include normal aging changes that impair physical function, activities, and appearance; disability from injury or chronic illness; social and environmental losses related to loss of income and decreased ability to perform previous roles and activities; and the deaths of significant others. Many older adults rely strongly on their families and spiritual beliefs for comfort during stressful times.</p>
<p class="indent">An additional aspect of coping that nurse researchers have examined is self-efficacy, which is the confidence to perform well at a particular task or life domain (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib566">Hladek, Gill, Bandeen-Roche, et al., 2019</a>). <a href="#ct8-2">Chart&#x00A0;8-2</a> is a Nursing Research Profile about the associations between coping self-efficacy and frailty in a group of community-dwelling older adults.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Living Arrangements</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many older adults have more than adequate financial resources and good health even until very late in life; therefore, they have many housing options. In 2017, 93% of older adults lived in the community, with a relatively small percentage (2.3%) residing in nursing homes and a comparable percentage living in some type of senior housing. Seventy-six percent of those older than 65 years own their homes. In 2018, 28% of noninstitutionalized older people lived alone, and widowed women predominated. In 2018, 70% of men older than 65 years were married compared with 40% of women in the same age group. This difference in marital status increases with age and is a result of several factors: Women have a longer life expectancy than men; women tend to marry older men; and women tend to remain widowed, whereas men often remarry (AoA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Many older adults relocate in response to changes in their lives such as retirement or widowhood, a significant deterioration in health, or disability. The type of housing they choose depends on their reason for moving. With increasing disability and illness, older adults may move to retirement facilities or assisted living communities that provide some support such as meals, transportation, and housekeeping but otherwise allow them to live somewhat independently. If they develop a serious illness or disability and can no longer live independently or semi-independently, they may need to move to a setting where additional support is available, such as a relative&#x2019;s home or a long-term care or assisted living facility. Often they will seek a location near an adult child&#x2019;s home.</p>
<p class="h7">Living at Home or With Family</p>
<p class="nonindent">Most older adults want to remain in their own homes; in fact, they function best in their own environment. The family home and familiar community may have strong emotional significance for them, and this should not be ignored. However, with advanced age and increasing disability, adjustments to the environment may be required to allow older adults to remain in their own homes or apartments. Additional family support or more formal support may be necessary to compensate for declining function and mobility. Many services and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page177" title="177"></span>organizations can assist older adults to successfully &#x201C;age in place&#x201D; in their own homes or in assisted living facilities (see Resources at the end of this chapter).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>The Association Between Coping Self-efficacy and Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Adults</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Hladek, M.D., Gill, J., Bandeen-Roche, K., et al. (2019). High coping self-efficacy associated with lower odds of pre-frailty/ frailty in older adults with chronic disease. <em>Aging &#x0026; Mental Health</em>. doi.<a href="http://org/10.1080/13607863.2019.1639136">org/10.1080/13607863.2019.1639136</a></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Self-efficacy is the confidence to perform well at a particular task or life domain while frailty is a state of decreased physiologic reserve and vulnerability to negative health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between self-efficacy and frailty in a group of community-dwelling older adults.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This quantitative study used a cross-sectional design to study 146 older adults who lived in retirement communities. Instruments included the five-item Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of weight (FRAIL) scale as well as two self-efficacy instruments that measured confidence in one&#x2019;s ability to problem solve, emotionally regulate, and ask for support when problems in life occur. Additional variables measured included illness intrusiveness, depressive symptoms, financial strain, life events, social support, heart rate, tobacco use, and body mass index (BMI). Logistic regression was used for model development.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Approximately half of the participants were in the frail or pre-frail range on the FRAIL scale. High coping self-efficacy was associated with a 92% reduction in the odds of participants being in the frail or pre-frail range on the FRAIL scale after adjusting for age, race, comorbidities, heart rate, life events count, and BMI. This relationship remained a significant finding even after the inclusion of illness intrusiveness and depressive symptoms (OR: 0.10, <em>p</em>-value = 0.014). Higher age, number of comorbidities, heart rate, and BMI were also significantly associated with participants being in the frail or pre-frail range on the FRAIL scale.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">When working with older adults, nurses should keep in mind the association of high self-efficacy with healthy aging. Nurses can be instrumental in developing interventions to help older adults increase self-efficacy, as measured by their confidence in their ability to problem solve, emotionally regulate, and ask for support when problems in life occur.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Sometimes older adults or couples move in with adult children. This can be a rewarding experience as the children, their parents, and the grandchildren interact and share household responsibilities (see <a href="#ff8-3">Fig.&#x00A0;8-3</a>). It can also be stressful, depending on family dynamics. Adult children and their older parents may choose to pool their financial resources by moving into a house that has an attached &#x201C;in-law suite.&#x201D; This arrangement provides security for the older adult and privacy for both families. Many older adults and their adult children make housing decisions in times of crisis, such as during a serious illness or after the death of a spouse. Caring for an older adult may also be stressful; older adults and their families often are unaware of the emotional and physical demands of shared housing and assuming care for an increasingly dependent person, especially given the uncertain and extended length of time that may be associated with caring for a person with a chronic illness. Families can be helped by anticipatory guidance and long-term planning before a crisis occurs. Older adults should participate in decisions that affect them as much as possible.</p>

<p class="h7">Continuing Care Retirement Communities</p>
<p class="nonindent">Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) offer three levels of living arrangements and care that provide for aging in place (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). CCRCs consist of independent single-dwelling houses or apartments for people who can manage their day-to-day needs, assisted living apartments for those who need limited assistance with their daily living needs, and skilled nursing services when continuous nursing assistance is required. CCRCs usually contract for a large down payment before the resident moves into the community. This payment gives a person or couple the option of residing in the same community from the time of total independence through the need for assisted or skilled nursing care. Decisions about living arrangements and health care can be made before any decline in health status occurs. CCRCs also provide continuity at a time in an older adult&#x2019;s life when many other factors, such as health status, income, and availability of friends and family members, may be changing.</p>
<p class="h7">Assisted Living Facilities</p>
<p class="nonindent">Assisted living facilities are an option when an older person&#x2019;s physical or cognitive changes necessitate at least minimal supervision or assistance. Assisted living allows for a degree of independence while providing minimal nursing assistance with administration of medication, assistance with ADLs, or other chronic health care needs. Other services, such as laundry, cleaning, and meals, may also be included. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" title="178"></span>Both assisted living and CCRCs are costly and primarily paid out-of-pocket.</p>
<p class="h7">Long-Term Care Facilities</p>
<p class="nonindent">Many types of nursing homes, nursing facilities, or long-term care facilities offer continuous nursing care. Contrary to the myth of family abandonment and the fear of &#x201C;ending up in a nursing home,&#x201D; the actual percentage of older adults residing in long-term care facilities has declined, from 5.4% in 1985 to 2.3% in 2018 (AoA, 2020). However, the actual number of older people who reside in long-term care facilities has risen owing to the large increase in the population of older adults and the use of nursing homes for short-term rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="indent">Short-term nursing facility care is often reimbursed by Medicare if the patient is recovering from an acute illness such as a stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or cancer and requires skilled nursing care or therapy for recuperation. Usually, if an older adult suffers a major health event and is hospitalized and then goes to a nursing facility, Medicare covers the cost of the first 30 to 90 days in a skilled nursing facility as long as ongoing therapy is needed. The requirement for continued Medicare coverage during this time is documentation of persistent improvement in the condition that requires therapy, most often physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, or cognitive therapy. Some adults choose to have long-term care insurance as a means of paying, at least in part, for the cost of these services should they become necessary. Costs of long-term care for older adults who are living in nursing homes and are medically stable, despite having multiple chronic and debilitating health issues, are primarily paid out-of-pocket by the patient. When a person&#x2019;s financial resources become exhausted as a result of prolonged nursing home care, the patient, the institution, or both may apply for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement depending on the situation. Family members are not responsible for nursing home costs.</p>
<p class="indent">An increasing number of skilled nursing facilities offer subacute care. This area of the facility offers a high level of nursing care that may either avoid the need for a resident to be transferred to a hospital from the nursing home or allow a hospitalized patient to be transferred back to the nursing facility sooner.</p>
<h6 class="h6">The Role of the Family</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Planning for care and understanding the psychosocial issues confronting older adults must be accomplished within the context of the family. If dependency needs occur, the spouse often assumes the role of primary caregiver. In the absence of a surviving spouse, an adult child may assume caregiver responsibilities and need help in providing or arranging for care and support.</p>
<p class="indent">Two common myths in American society are that adult children and their aged parents are socially alienated, and that adult children abandon their parents when health and other dependency problems arise. In reality, the family has been and continues to be an important source of support for older adults; similarly, older family members provide a great deal of support to younger family members.</p>
<p class="indent">Although adult children are not financially responsible for their older parents, social attitudes and cultural values often dictate that adult children should provide services and assume the burden of care if their aged parents cannot care for themselves. It is estimated that in 2018, informal caregivers provided 18.5 billion hours of unpaid care (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib550">Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association, 2019</a>). Caregiving, which may continue for many years, can become a source of family stress and is a well-known risk for psychiatric and physical morbidity. Evidence-based interventions to reduce distress and enhance well-being in caregivers have been identified. Three broad types of effective programs include psychoeducational skill building, cognitive behavioral therapy, and using a combination of at least two approaches such as education, family meetings, and skill building sessions (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Bakas, McCarthy, &#x0026; Miller, 2018</a>). Researchers have reported that web-based interventions are effective, efficient, and a better fit for the hectic lives of families and caregivers (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Wasilewski, Stinson, &#x0026; Cameron, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s153">Cognitive Aspects of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cognition can be affected by many variables, including sensory impairment, physiologic health, environment, sleep, and psychosocial influences. Older adults may experience temporary changes in cognitive function (i.e., delirium) when hospitalized or admitted to skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation centers, or long-term care facilities. These changes are related to differences in the environment or in medical therapy or to alteration in role performance. A commonly used assessment tool is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (see <a href="#ct8-3">Chart&#x00A0;8-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Good sleep hygiene can improve cognition, as can treatment of depression and anxiety. Several researchers are evaluating memory enhancement programs for older adults. In addition, researchers have found that eating a healthy balanced diet, being physically active for at least 30 minutes each day, and getting plenty of sleep can assist in preventing chronic illnesses as well as improving cognitive function (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">McDougall, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When intelligence test scores from people of all ages are compared, test scores for older adults show a progressive decline beginning in midlife. However, research has shown <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page179" title="179"></span>that environment and health have a considerable influence on scores, and that certain types of intelligence (e.g., spatial perceptions and retention of nonintellectual information) decline, whereas others (e.g., problem-solving ability based on past experiences, verbal comprehension, mathematical ability) do not. Cardiovascular health, a stimulating environment, and high levels of education, occupational status, and income all appear to have a positive effect on intelligence scores in later life.</p>

<p class="indent">Significant age-related declines in intelligence, learning, and memory are not inevitable. Many factors affect the ability of older adults to learn and remember and to perform well in testing situations. Older adults who have higher levels of education, good sensory function, good nutrition, and jobs that require complex problem-solving skills continue to demonstrate intelligence, memory, and the capacity for learning. Part of the challenge in testing older adults is determining what is actually being tested (e.g., speed of response) and whether the test results are indicative of a normal age-related change, a sensory deficit, or poor health. However, age differences continue to emerge even with untimed tests and when the tests are controlled for variations in motor and sensory function. In general, fluid intelligence&#x2014;the biologically determined intelligence used for flexibility in thinking and problem solving&#x2014;declines. Preventing or managing circulatory and nervous system disorders may positively affect the decline in fluid intelligence. Crystallized intelligence&#x2014;gained through education and lifelong experiences (e.g., verbal skills)&#x2014;remains intact. These differences exemplify the classic aging pattern of intelligence. Despite these slight declines, many older adults continue to learn and participate in varied educational experiences. Good health and motivation are important influences on learning (see <a href="#ct8-4">Chart&#x00A0;8-4</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s154">Pharmacologic Aspects of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because an increasing number of chronic conditions affect older adults, they use more medications than any other age group. Although medications improve health and well-being by relieving pain and discomfort, treating chronic illnesses, and curing infectious processes, adverse drug reactions are common because of medication interactions, multiple medication effects, incorrect dosages, and the use of multiple medications.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Drug Interactions and Adverse Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;polypharmacy:&lt;/b&gt; the use of multiple prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications">Polypharmacy</button></strong> is the use of multiple prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Over or incorrect prescribing occurs commonly in older adults (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). The potential for drug&#x2013;drug interactions increases with increased medication use and with multiple coexisting diseases (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;comorbidity:&lt;/b&gt; having more than one illness at the same time (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure)">comorbidity</button></strong>) that affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the medications. Such interactions are responsible for numerous emergency department and primary provider visits, which cost billions of dollars annually.</p>
<p class="indent">Any medication is capable of altering nutritional status, and the nutritional health of an older adult may already be compromised by a marginal diet or by chronic disease and its treatment. Medications can affect the appetite, cause nausea and vomiting, irritate the stomach, cause constipation or diarrhea, and decrease absorption of nutrients. In addition, these medications may alter electrolyte balance as well as carbohydrate and fat metabolism. For example, antacids may cause thiamine deficiency; laxatives diminish absorption; antibiotics and phenytoin reduce utilization of folic acid; and phenothiazines, estrogens, and corticosteroids increase appetite and cause weight gain.</p>
<p class="indent">Combining multiple medications with alcohol, as well as with OTC and herbal medications, further complicates GI problems. For example, St. John&#x2019;s wort, a common herbal supplement effective for mild depression, decreases the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and interacts with many other medications metabolized in the liver (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Tools such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> are available to evaluate the patterns of drug use in older adults (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib563">Fick, Selma, Steinman, et al., 2019</a>). The criteria rate the evidence for potentially harmful medications according to body systems. They are updated every 4 years in an attempt to improve the care of older adults by limiting their exposure to potentially inappropriate medications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Altered Pharmacokinetics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Alterations in absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion occur as a result of normal aging and may also result from drug and food interactions (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Absorption may be affected by changes in gastric pH and a decrease in GI motility. Drug distribution may be altered as a result of decrease in body water and increase in body fat. Normal age-related changes and diseases that alter blood flow, liver and renal function, or cardiac output (CO) may affect distribution and metabolism (see <a href="#tt8-2">Table&#x00A0;8-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Implications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Principles that have been identified as appropriate for older patients include starting with a low dose, going slowly, keeping the medication regimen as simple as possible, and reconciling new and previous medication regimens at the time of discharge from an acute hospital stay (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Fick et al., 2019</a>). A comprehensive assessment that begins with a thorough medication history, including use <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" title="180"></span>of alcohol, recreational drugs, and OTC and herbal medications, is essential. It is best to ask the patient or reliable informants to provide all medications for review. Assessing the patient&#x2019;s understanding of when and how to take each prescription and OTC medication, as well as the purpose of each medication, allows the nurse to assess the patient&#x2019;s health literacy and adherence to the medication regimen. The patient&#x2019;s beliefs and concerns about the medications should be identified, including beliefs on whether a given medication is helpful.</p>

<p class="indent">Nonadherence with medication regimens can lead to significant morbidity and mortality among older adults. The many contributing factors include the number of medications prescribed, the complexity of the regimen, difficulty opening containers, inadequate patient education, financial cost, and the disease or medication interfering with the patient&#x2019;s life. Visual and hearing problems may make it difficult to read or to hear directions. Multifaceted interventions tailored to the individual patient are the most effective strategies in improving adherence. Allowing enough time for the older adult to learn new skills, particularly when technology is involved, is essential (see <a href="c08-sec03.xhtml#ct8-5">Chart&#x00A0;8-5</a>).</p>
