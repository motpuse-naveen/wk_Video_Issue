<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rhinosinusitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the nares and paranasal sinuses, including frontal, ethmoid, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses; replaces the term &lt;em&gt;sinusitis&lt;/em&gt;">Rhinosinusitis</button></strong>, formerly called <em>sinusitis,</em> is an inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&#x2013;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (2018; Rosenfeld, Andes, Bhattacharyya, et&#x00A0;al., 2015) recommends the use of the term <em>rhinosinusitis</em> because sinusitis is almost always accompanied by inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Rhinosinusitis affects about 35 million people in the United States each year and accounts for 16 million office visits (Brook, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Uncomplicated rhinosinusitis occurs without extension of inflammation outside of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Rhinosinusitis is classified by duration of symptoms as acute (less than 4 weeks), subacute (4 to 12 weeks), and chronic (more than 12 weeks). Rhinosinusitis can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s551">Acute Rhinosinusitis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Acute rhinosinusitis is classified as acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) or acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS). Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is characterized by four or more acute episodes of ABRS per year (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Patel &#x0026; Hwang, 2019</a>) and is discussed with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s552">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute rhinosinusitis usually follows a viral URI or cold, such as an unresolved viral or bacterial infection, or an exacerbation of allergic rhinitis. Normally, the sinus openings into the nasal passages are clear and infections resolve promptly. However, if their drainage is obstructed by a deviated septum or by hypertrophied turbinates, spurs, or nasal polyps or tumors, sinus infection may persist as a secondary infection or progress to an acute suppurative process (causing purulent discharge).</p>
<p class="indent">Nasal congestion, caused by inflammation, edema, and transudation of fluid secondary to URI, leads to obstruction of the sinus cavities (see <a href="c18-sec02.xhtml#ff18-1">Fig.&#x00A0;18-1</a>). This provides an excellent medium for bacterial growth. Other conditions and activities that can block the normal flow of sinus secretions include abnormal structures of the nose, enlarged adenoids, diving and swimming, tooth infection, trauma to the nose, tumors, and the pressure of foreign objects. Some people are more prone to rhinosinusitis because exposure to environmental hazards such as paint, sawdust, and chemicals may result in chronic inflammation of the nasal passages.</p>
<p class="indent">Bacterial organisms account for more than 60% of the cases of acute rhinosinusitis. Typical pathogens include <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,</em> and less commonly <em>Staphylococcus aureus,</em> and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> (Brook, 2018b). Biofilms, which consist of organized, heterogeneous communities of bacteria, have been found to be 10 to 1000 times more resistant to antibiotic treatment and more likely to contribute to host resistance when compared with other bacteria. They serve as bacterial reservoirs that can cause systemic illness when released into the circulation. Although antibiotics kill bacteria in the biofilm margin, cells deep in the biofilm are not affected, allowing for regrowth once antibiotic therapy has been discontinued. Pathogens in the upper respiratory tract that form biofilms include those species listed earlier as well as <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Other organisms that are occasionally isolated include <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes,</em> viruses, and fungi (<em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>). Fungal infections occur most often in patients who are immunosuppressed (Brook, 2018b). The most common organisms found with health care-associated (nosocomial) infections include <em>P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</em> and <em>Enterobacter</em> species, accounting for 60% of those cases (Brook, 2018b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s553">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of ABRS include purulent nasal drainage (anterior, posterior, or both) accompanied by nasal obstruction or a combination of facial pain, pressure, or a sense of fullness (referred to collectively as facial pain&#x2013;pressure&#x2013;fullness), or both (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1418">Rosenfeld et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Sedaghat, 2017</a>). The facial pain&#x2013;pressure&#x2013;fullness may involve the anterior face or the periorbital region. The patient may also report cloudy or colored nasal discharge congestion, blockage, or stuffiness as well as a localized or diffuse headache. Patients with ABRS may present with a high fever (i.e., 39&#x00B0;C [102&#x00B0;F] or higher). In addition, the occurrence of symptoms for 10 days or more after the initial onset of upper respiratory symptoms indicates ABRS (Brook, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of AVRS are similar to those of ABRS, except the patient does not present with a high fever, nor with the same intensity of symptoms (e.g., there tends to be an absence of facial pain&#x2013;pressure&#x2013;fullness), nor with symptoms that persist for as long a period of time. Symptoms of AVRS occur for fewer than 10 days after the onset of upper respiratory symptoms and do not worsen (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Papadakis, McPhee, &#x0026; Rabow, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s554">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A careful history and physical examination are performed. The head and neck, particularly the nose, ears, teeth, sinuses, pharynx, and chest, are examined. There may be tenderness to palpation over the infected sinus area. The sinuses are percussed using the index finger, tapping lightly to determine whether the patient experiences pain. Although less frequently performed, transillumination of the affected area may reveal a decrease in the transmission of light with rhinosinusitis (see <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>). Diagnostic imaging (x-ray, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is not recommended and generally not needed for the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis if the patient meets clinical diagnostic criteria (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Aring &#x0026; Chan, 2016</a>; <a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1418">Rosenfeld et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). When a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, diagnostic imaging may be indicated to help identify inflammatory changes, bone destruction, and anatomic variations that can guide sinus surgery (if indicated).</p>
<p class="indent">To confirm the diagnosis of maxillary and frontal rhinosinusitis and identify the pathogen, sinus aspirates may be obtained. Flexible endoscopic culture techniques and swabbing of the sinuses have been used for this purpose (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 499</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page500" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="500">p. 500</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s555">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If untreated, acute rhinosinusitis may lead to severe complications. Local complications include osteomyelitis and mucocele (cyst of the paranasal sinuses). Osteomyelitis requires prolonged antibiotic therapy and at times removal of necrotic bone. Intracranial complications, although rare, include cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, brain abscess, ischemic brain infarction, and severe orbital cellulitis (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Mucoceles may require surgical treatment to establish intranasal drainage or complete excision with ablation of the sinus cavity. Brain abscesses occur by direct spread and can be life-threatening. Frontal epidural abscesses are usually quiescent but can be detected by CT scan.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s556">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of acute rhinosinusitis depends on the cause; a 14-day course of antibiotics is prescribed for bacterial cases (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Tewfik, 2018</a>). The goals of treatment for acute rhinosinusitis are to shrink the nasal mucosa, relieve pain, and treat infection. Because of the inappropriate use of antibiotics for nonbacterial illness, including AVRS, and the resulting resistance that has occurred, oral antibiotics are only prescribed when there is sufficient empiric evidence that the patient has ABRS (e.g., high fever or symptoms that persist for at least 10 days or worsening symptoms following a viral respiratory illness).</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotics should be given as soon as the diagnosis of ABRS is established. Amoxicillin or amoxicillin&#x2013;clavulanic acid are the antibiotics of choice. For patients who are allergic to penicillin, doxycycline or respiratory quinolones such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin can be prescribed (CDC, 2017). Other antibiotics prescribed previously to treat ABRS, including cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cefixime), macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin and azithromycin), and trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole are no longer recommended because they are not effective in treating antibiotic-resistant organisms that are now more commonly implicated in ABRS (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Tewfik, 2018</a>). Intranasal saline lavage is an effective adjunct therapy to antibiotics in that it may relieve symptoms, reduce inflammation, and help clear the passages of stagnant mucus. Neither decongestants nor antihistamines are recommended adjunctive medications for treating ABRS (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Tewfik, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of AVRS typically involves nasal saline lavage and decongestants (guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine). Decongestants or nasal saline sprays can increase patency of the ostiomeatal unit and improve drainage of the sinuses. Topical decongestants should not be used for longer than 3 or 4 days. Oral decongestants must be used cautiously in patients with hypertension. OTC antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and cetirizine, and prescription antihistamines, such as fexofenadine, are used if an allergic component is suspected.</p>
<p class="indent">Intranasal corticosteroids have been shown to produce complete or marked improvement in acute symptoms of either bacterial or viral rhinosinusitis; however, they are only recommended for use in patients with a previous history of allergic rhinitis (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1418">Rosenfeld et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Examples of intranasal corticosteroids, side effects, and contraindications are presented in <a href="#tt18-2">Table&#x00A0;18-2</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s557">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education is an important aspect of nursing care for the patient with acute rhinosinusitis. The nurse instructs the patient about symptoms of complications that require immediate follow-up. Referral to the primary provider is indicated if periorbital edema and severe pain on palpation occur. The nurse instructs the patient about methods to promote drainage of the sinuses, including humidification of the air in the home and the use of warm compresses to relieve pressure. The patient is advised to avoid swimming, diving, and air travel during the acute infection. Patients using tobacco are instructed to immediately stop smoking or using any form of tobacco. Many patients use nasal sprays incorrectly, which can lead to several side effects that include nasal irritation, nasal burning, bad taste, and drainage in the throat or even <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;epistaxis:&lt;/b&gt; hemorrhage from the nose due to rupture of tiny, distended vessels in the mucous membrane of any area of the nose">epistaxis</button></strong> (hemorrhage from the nose). Therefore, if an intranasal corticosteroid is prescribed, it is important to instruct the patient about the correct use of prescribed nasal sprays through demonstration, explanation, and return demonstration to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s understanding of the correct method of administration. The nurse also educates the patient about the side effects of prescribed and OTC nasal sprays and about rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion). Once the decongestant is discontinued, the nasal passages close and congestion results. Appropriate medications to use for pain relief include acetaminophen and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page501" title="501"></span>naproxen sodium, and aspirin for adults older than 20 years as long as there are no contraindications to use.</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse tells patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis to begin decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, at the first sign of rhinosinusitis. This promotes drainage and decreases the risk of bacterial infection. Patients should also check with their primary provider or pharmacist before using OTC medications because many cold medications can worsen symptoms or other health problems, specifically hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse stresses the importance of following the recommended antibiotic regimen because a consistent blood level of the medication is critical to treat the infection. The nurse educates the patient about the early signs of a sinus infection and recommends preventive measures such as following healthy practices and avoiding contact with people with URIs.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse explains to the patient that fever, severe headache, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nuchal rigidity:&lt;/b&gt; stiffness of the neck or inability to bend the neck">nuchal rigidity</button></strong> (stiffness of the neck or inability to bend the neck) are signs of the potential complication of meningitis. Patients with chronic symptoms of rhinosinusitis who do not have marked improvement in 4 weeks with continuous medical treatment may be candidates for functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS, see later discussion) (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Tajudeen &#x0026; Kennedy, 2017</a>).</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s558">Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Recurrent Acute Rhinosinusitis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">The prevalence of CRS is about 146 per 1000 population in the United States and occurs most commonly in young and middle-aged adults (Brook, 2018b). It is diagnosed when the patient has experienced 12 weeks or longer of two or more of the following symptoms: mucopurulent drainage, nasal obstruction, facial pain&#x2013;pressure&#x2013;fullness, or hyposmia (decreased sense of smell). It is estimated that in about 40% of patients, CRS is accompanied by nasal polyps (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1418">Rosenfeld et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is diagnosed when four or more episodes of ABRS occur per year with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis between the episodes. The use of antibiotics in patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is higher than in patients with CRS. Both CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis affect quality of life as well as physical and social function (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Hamilos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s559">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical obstruction in the ostia of the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses (known collectively as the ostiomeatal complex) is the usual cause of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Obstruction prevents adequate drainage of the nasal passages, resulting in accumulation of secretions and an ideal medium for bacterial growth. Persistent blockage in an adult may occur because of infection, allergy, or structural abnormalities. Other associated conditions and factors may include cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, neoplastic disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, tobacco use, and environmental pollution (Brook, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria have been implicated in CRS and recurrent rhinosinusitis. Common aerobic bacteria include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, microaerophilic streptococci, and <em>S. aureus.</em> Common anaerobic bacteria include gram-negative bacilli, <em>Peptostreptococcus,</em> and <em>Fusobacterium.</em></p>
<p class="indent">In addition, immunodeficiency should be considered in patients with CRS or acute recurrent rhinosinusitis. Acute fulminant/invasive rhinosinusitis is a life-threatening illness and is commonly attributed to <em>Aspergillus</em> in immunocompromised patients. Chronic fungal sinusitis also poses a risk. Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis occurs in immunocompromised patients along with fungus ball/mycetoma and allergic fungal sinusitis&#x2014;the more common forms of chronic fungal sinusitis&#x2014;which are considered noninvasive conditions in immunocompromised patients. The fungus ball is characterized by the presence of a noninvasive accumulation of a dense conglomeration of fungal hyphae in one sinus cavity, usually the maxillary sinus. The fungus generally remains contained in the fungus ball, which consists of mucopurulent cheesy or claylike materials within the sinus, but can become invasive when immunosuppression occurs, leading to encephalopathy (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Ramadan, 2018</a>). Symptoms include nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, and facial pain. Vision loss, headache, and cranial nerve palsies have been identified in patients with a sphenoid sinus fungal ball (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Ramadan, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s560">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations of CRS include impaired mucociliary clearance and ventilation, cough (because the thick discharge constantly drips backward into the nasopharynx), chronic hoarseness, chronic headaches in the periorbital area, periorbital edema, and facial pain. As a result of chronic nasal congestion, the patient is usually required to breathe through the mouth. Snoring, sore throat, and, in some situations, adenoidal hypertrophy may also occur. Symptoms are generally most pronounced on awakening in the morning. Fatigue and nasal congestion are also common. Many patients experience a decrease in smell and taste and a sense of fullness in the ears.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s561">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The health assessment focuses on onset and duration of symptoms. It addresses the quantity and quality of nasal discharge and cough, the presence of pain, factors that relieve or aggravate the pain, and allergies. It is essential to obtain any history of comorbid conditions, including asthma and history of tobacco use and smoking or use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars. A history of fever, fatigue, previous episodes and treatments and previous response to therapies is also obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">In the physical assessment, the external nose is evaluated for any evidence of anatomic abnormality. A crooked-appearing external nose may imply septal deviation internally. The nasal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page502" title="502"></span>mucous membranes are assessed for erythema, pallor, atrophy, edema, crusting, discharge, polyps, erosions, and septal perforations or deviations. Appropriate lighting improves visualization of the nasal cavity and should be used in every examination. Pain on examination of the teeth, with tapping with a tongue blade, suggests tooth infection (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Bickley &#x0026; Szilagyi, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of the posterior oropharynx may reveal purulent or mucoid discharge, which is indicative of an infection caused by CRS. The patient&#x2019;s eyes are examined for conjunctival erythema, tearing, photophobia, and edema of the lids. Additional assessment techniques include transillumination of the sinuses and palpation of the sinuses. The frontal and maxillary sinuses are palpated, and the patient is asked whether this produces tenderness. The pharynx is inspected for erythema and discharge and palpated for cervical node adenopathy (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Hamilos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Imaging studies such as x-ray, sinoscopy, ultrasound, CT scanning, and MRI may be used in the diagnosis of CRS. X-ray is an inexpensive and readily available tool to assess disorders of the paranasal sinuses. A CT scan of the paranasal sinuses can identify mucosal abnormalities, sinus ostial obstruction, anatomic variants, sinonasal polyposis, and neoplastic disease. In addition, nasal endoscopy allows for visualization of the posterior nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and sinus drainage pathways and can identify posterior septal deviation and polyps. Osseous destruction, extrasinus extension of the disease process, and local invasion suggest malignancy (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1418">Rosenfeld et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s562">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of CRS, although uncommon, include severe orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, encephalitis, and ischemic infarction. CRS can lead to intracranial infection either by direct spread through bone or via venous channels, resulting in epidural abscess, subdural empyema, meningitis, and brain abscess. Clinical sequelae can include personality changes with frontal lobe abscesses, headache, symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure to include alterations of consciousness, visual changes, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and, ultimately, coma and death.</p>
<p class="indent">Frontal rhinosinusitis can lead to osteomyelitis of the frontal bones. Patients typically present with headache, fever, and a characteristic doughy edema over the involved bone. Ethmoid rhinosinusitis may result in orbital cellulitis, which usually begins with edema of the eyelids and rapidly progresses to ptosis (droopy eyelid), proptosis (bulging eye), chemosis (edema of the bulbar conjunctiva), and diminished extraocular movements. Patients are usually febrile and acutely ill and require immediate attention, because pressure on the optic nerve can lead to loss of vision and spread of infection can lead to intracranial infection (Brook, 2018a). Cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis can result from extension of infection along venous channels from the orbit, ethmoid or frontal sinuses, or nose. Symptoms may include altered consciousness, lid edema, and proptosis, as well as third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s563">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is similar to that of acute rhinosinusitis. General measures include encouraging adequate hydration and recommending the use of OTC nasal saline sprays, antispasmodic agents such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and decongestants such as oxymetazoline and pseudoephedrine (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1388">Brook, 2018b; Tewfik, 2018</a>). Patients are instructed to sleep with the head of the bed elevated and to avoid exposure to cigarette smoke and fumes. Patients are cautioned to avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can cause dehydration.</p>
<p class="indent">Prescribed antibiotics may include amoxicillin&#x2013;clavulanic acid, erythromycin&#x2013;sulfisoxazole, second- or third-generation cephalosporins such as cefuroxime or cefixime, or newer fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin (Brook, 2018b). The course of antibiotic treatment for CRS and recurrent ABRS is typically as long as 2 to 4 weeks to effectively eradicate the offending organism, and may be indicated for up to 12 months in some cases (Brook, 2018b). Corticosteroid nasal sprays such as fluticasone or beclomethasone may be indicated in patients with concomitant allergic rhinitis or nasal polyps. Patients with allergic rhinitis may also benefit from the addition of a mast cell stabilizer such as cromolyn. For patients with concomitant asthma, leukotriene inhibitors such as montelukast and zafirlukast may be used (Brook, 2018b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If standard medical therapy fails and symptoms persist, FESS may be indicated to correct structural deformities that obstruct the ostia (openings) of the sinuses. FESS is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and improvement in the patient&#x2019;s quality of life. In particular, FESS is associated with either complete or moderate relief of symptoms in more than 85% to 91% of patients (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Patel, 2016</a>). Some of the specific procedures performed include excising and cauterizing nasal polyps, correcting a deviated septum, incising and draining the sinuses, aerating the sinuses, and removing tumors. Computer-assisted or computer-guided surgery is used to increase the precision of the surgical procedure and to minimize complications. Antimicrobial agents are typically prescribed after surgery (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Patel, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Surgical intervention is first-line treatment in acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis to excise the fungus ball and necrotic tissue and drain the sinuses. Patients require aggressive surgical d&#x00E9;bridement and drainage as well as systemic antifungal medications (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Ramadan, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s564">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients usually perform care measures for rhinosinusitis at home; therefore, nursing management consists of good patient education.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many people with sinus infections tend to blow their nose frequently and with force to clear their nasal passages. Doing so often increases the symptoms; therefore, the patient is instructed to blow the nose gently and to use tissue to remove the nasal drainage. Increasing fluid intake, applying local heat (hot wet packs), and elevating the head of the bed promote drainage of the sinuses. The nurse also instructs the patient about the importance of following the prescribed medication regimen. Instructions on the early signs of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page503" title="503"></span>sinus infection are provided, and preventive measures are reviewed. The nurse instructs the patient about signs and symptoms that require follow-up and provides these instructions verbally and in writing. Instructions in alternative formats (e.g., large font, patient&#x2019;s language) may be needed to increase the patient&#x2019;s understanding and adherence to the treatment plan. The nurse encourages the patient to follow up with their primary provider if symptoms persist (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1382">American Academy of Otolaryngology&#x2013;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>URIs, specifically CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, may be linked to primary or secondary immune deficiency or treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., for cancer or organ transplantation). Typical symptoms may be blunted or absent due to immunosuppression. Immunocompromised patients are at the increased risk for acute or chronic fungal infections; these infections can progress rapidly and become life-threatening (Brook, 2018a; Brook, 2018b). Thus, assessment, early reporting of symptoms to the patient&#x2019;s primary provider, and immediate initiation of treatment are essential.</em></p></div>
