<h4 class="h4" id="s3087">Spinal Cord Tumors</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tumors within the spinal canal are classified according to their anatomic relation to the spinal cord (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). They include intramedullary lesions (within the spinal cord), extramedullary-intradural lesions (within or under the spinal dura), and extramedullary-extradural lesions (outside the dural membrane). Primary tumors are usually intramedullary, consisting of astrocytoma or ependymoma; meningiomas can occur as extramedullary-intradural lesions (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Epstein, 2018</a>). Secondary tumors are far more common and are usually extramedullary-extradural lesions. Tumors that occur within the spinal canal or exert pressure on it cause symptoms ranging from localized or shooting pains, weakness, and loss of reflexes below the tumor level to progressive loss of motor function and paralysis. Usually, sharp pain occurs in the area innervated by the spinal roots that arise from the cord in the region of the tumor. In addition, increasing sensory deficits develop below the level of the lesion. Loss of bowel and bladder function is common.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3088">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neurologic examination and diagnostic studies are used to make the diagnosis. Neurologic examination focuses on assessing pain and identifying loss of reflexes, sensation, or motor function. Helpful diagnostic studies include CT scans, MRI scans, and biopsy. The MRI scan is the most commonly used and the most sensitive diagnostic tool (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>) and it is particularly helpful in detecting epidural spinal cord compression and metastases (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Kaplow &#x0026; Iyere, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3089">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of specific intraspinal tumors depends on the type and location of the tumor, the presenting symptoms, and the patient&#x2019;s physical status. Surgical intervention is the primary treatment for most spinal cord tumors followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Extramedullary-extradural spinal cord compression occurs in 5% to 7% of patients who die of cancer and is considered a neurologic emergency (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Kaplow &#x0026; Iyere, 2016</a>). For the patient with spinal cord compression resulting from metastatic cancer (most commonly from breast, prostate, or lung), high-dose dexamethasone combined with radiation therapy is effective in relieving pain (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for a discussion of care of the patient with spinal cord compression). Palliative care may be an option for the medical management of some patients. Chemotherapy specific to the tumor type may be considered (AANN, 2016).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tumor removal is desirable but not always possible. The goal is to remove as much tumor as possible while sparing uninvolved portions of the spinal cord. Sudden decrease or loss of motor, sensory, and bowel and bladder function indicates the need for emergent surgery to reestablish function and protect the cord from further damage (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Microsurgical techniques have improved the prognosis for patients with intramedullary tumors. Extramedullary-intradural tumors may be completely resected. Prognosis is related to the degree of neurologic impairment at the time of surgery, the speed with which symptoms occurred, and the origin of the tumor. Patients with extensive neurologic deficits before surgery are less likely to regain full functional recovery after successful tumor removal.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3090">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Preoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of preoperative care include recognition of neurologic changes through ongoing assessments, pain control, and management of altered activities of daily living (ADLs) resulting from sensory and motor deficits and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The nurse assesses for weakness, muscle wasting, spasticity, sensory changes, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and potential respiratory problems, especially if a cervical tumor is present. The patient is also evaluated for coagulation deficiencies. A history of anticoagulation medication use is obtained and reported, because the use of these may impede hemostasis postoperatively. The patient is educated about breathing exercises, and they are demonstrated preoperatively. Postoperative pain management strategies are discussed with the patient before surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Patient After Surgery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is monitored for deterioration in status with frequent and targeted assessments of vital signs and neurologic examinations (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A sudden onset of neurologic deficit is an ominous sign and may be due to spinal cord ischemia or infarction. Frequent neurologic checks are carried out, with emphasis on movement, strength, and sensation of the upper and lower extremities. Assessment of sensory function involves pinching the skin of the arms, legs, and trunk to determine if there is loss of feeling and, if so, at what level. Vital signs are monitored at regular intervals to detect and treat potential complications early (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hemmer, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The prescribed pain medication should be given in adequate amounts and at appropriate intervals to relieve pain and prevent its recurrence. Pain is the hallmark of spinal metastasis. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2122" title="2122"></span>Patients with sensory root involvement may suffer excruciating pain, which requires effective pain management.</p>
<p class="indent">The bed is usually kept flat initially. The nurse turns the patient as a unit, keeping shoulders and hips aligned and the back straight (also referred to as logrolling) (see discussion later in chapter). The side-lying position is usually the most comfortable, because this position imposes the least pressure on the surgical site. Placement of a pillow between the knees of the patient in a side-lying position helps to prevent extreme knee flexion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the tumor was in the cervical area, respiratory compromise due to postoperative edema may occur (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Kaplow &#x0026; Iyere, 2016</a>). The nurse monitors the patient for asymmetric chest movement, abdominal breathing, and abnormal breath sounds. For a high cervical lesion, the endotracheal tube remains in place until adequate respiratory function is ensured. The patient is encouraged to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises.</p>
<p class="indent">The area over the bladder is palpated or a bladder scan performed to assess for urinary retention (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>, <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#ff47-8">Fig.&#x00A0;47-8</a>). The nurse also monitors for incontinence, because urinary dysfunction usually implies significant decompensation of spinal cord function. An intake and output record is maintained. In addition, the abdomen is auscultated for bowel sounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Staining of the dressing may indicate leakage of CSF from the surgical site, which may lead to serious infection or to an inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissues that can cause severe pain in the postoperative period. Bulging at the incision may indicate contained CSF leak. The site should be monitored for increasing bulging, known as pseudomeningocele, which may require surgical repair (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4489">Alattar, Hirshman, McCutcheon, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="ex2" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">In preparation for discharge, the patient is assessed for the ability to function independently in the home and for the availability of resources such as family members to assist in caregiving. Patients with residual sensory involvement are cautioned about the dangers of extremes in temperature. They should be educated about the dangers of heating devices (e.g., hot water bottles, heating pads, space heaters) as their sensory integration may be impaired, causing them to lose the ability to detect dangerous stimulations and to react appropriately. The patient is educated to check skin integrity daily. Patients with impaired motor function related to motor weakness or paralysis may require training in ADLs and safe use of assistive devices, such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair. The patient and family members are educated about pain management strategies, bowel and bladder management, and assessment for signs and symptoms that should be reported promptly (see <a href="c65-sec03.xhtml#ct65-2">Chart&#x00A0;65-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Referral for inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation may be warranted to improve self-care abilities. A consultation for home, community-based, or transitional care may be indicated and provides the nurse with the opportunity to assess the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status and the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to adhere to recommended management strategies. During the home visit, the nurse determines whether changes in neurologic function have occurred. The patient&#x2019;s respiratory status and nutritional status are assessed. The adequacy of pain management is assessed, and modifications are made to ensure adequate pain relief. The need for hospice services or placement in an extended care facility is discussed with the patient and family if warranted, and the patient is asked about preferences for end-of-life care. In addition, social workers may be consulted to assist the patient and family members in identifying support services that can provide help in coping with the disease process (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
