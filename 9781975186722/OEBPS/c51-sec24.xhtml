<p class="nonindent">Death from cervical cancer is less common due to early detection of cell changes by Pap smear (ACS, 2019b). However, it is still the third most common female reproductive cancer in the United States (ACS, 2019b). Risk factors are presented in <a href="#ct51-5">Chart&#x00A0;51-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Preventive measures include regular pelvic examinations and Pap tests for all women, especially older women past childbearing age. Preventive counseling should encourage delaying first penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse, avoiding HPV infection, engaging only in safer sex, ceasing smoking, and receiving HPV immunization.</p>

<p class="indent">There are several different types of cervical cancer. Most of these cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest are adenocarcinomas or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas begin in mucous-producing glands and are often due to HPV infection. Most cervical cancers, if not detected and treated, spread to regional pelvic lymph nodes, and local recurrence is not uncommon (ACS, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2395">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Early cervical cancer rarely produces symptoms. If symptoms are present, they may go unnoticed as a thin, watery vaginal discharge often noticed after penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse or douching. When symptoms such as discharge, irregular bleeding, or pain or bleeding after penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse occur, the disease may be advanced. Advanced disease should not occur if all women have access to gynecologic care and avail themselves to it. The nurse&#x2019;s role in access to care and its utilization is crucial.</p>
<p class="indent">In advanced cervical cancer, the vaginal discharge gradually increases and becomes watery and, finally, dark and foul smelling from necrosis and infection. The bleeding, which occurs at irregular intervals between periods (metrorrhagia) or after menopause, may be slight (just enough to spot the undergarments) and occurs usually after mild trauma or pressure (e.g., penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse, douching, or bearing down during defecation). As the disease continues, the bleeding may persist and increase. Leg pain, dysuria, rectal bleeding, and edema of the extremities signal advanced disease.</p>
<p class="indent">As the cancer advances, it may invade the tissues outside the cervix, including the lymph glands anterior to the sacrum. In one third of patients with invasive cervical cancer, the disease <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1696" title="1696"></span>involves the fundus. The nerves in this region may be affected, producing excruciating pain in the back and the legs that is relieved only by large doses of opioid analgesic agents. If the disease progresses, it often produces extreme emaciation and anemia that usually is accompanied by fever (due to secondary infection and abscesses in the ulcerating mass) and by fistula formation. Because the survival rate for in situ cancer is 100% and the rate for women with more advanced stages of cervical cancer decreases dramatically, early detection is essential.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2396">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis may be made on the basis of abnormal Pap smear results, followed by biopsy results identifying severe dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type III [CIN III], high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HGSILs, also referred to as HSILs], or carcinoma in situ). HPV infections are usually implicated in these conditions. Carcinoma in situ is technically classified as severe dysplasia and is defined as cancer that has extended through the full thickness of the epithelium of the cervix, but not beyond. This is often referred to as preinvasive cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">In its very early stages, cervical cancer is found microscopically by Pap smear. In later stages, pelvic examination may reveal a large, reddish growth or a deep, ulcerating lesion. The patient may report spotting or bloody discharge.</p>
<p class="indent">When the patient has been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer, clinical staging estimates the extent of the disease so that treatment can be planned more specifically, and prognosis reasonably predicted. Staging is based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Staging Classification (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>):</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Stage I, the carcinoma is strictly confined to the cervix.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Stage II, the carcinoma invades beyond the uterus but not the pelvic wall or vagina.</span></li>
<li><span>Stage III, the tumor spreads to the pelvic wall and/or the vagina, and/or causes hydronephrosis of the kidneys.</span></li>
<li><span>Stage IV, the tumor has extended beyond the pelvis and involves the bladder or rectum.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms are evaluated, and x-rays, laboratory tests, and special examinations, such as biopsy and colposcopy, are performed (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Depending on the stage of the cancer, other tests and procedures may be performed to determine the extent of disease and appropriate treatment. These tests may include dilation and curettage (D&#x0026;C), CT scan, MRI scan, IV urography, cystography, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and barium x-ray studies. Treatment depends on the stage of the disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2397">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Precursor or Preinvasive Lesions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When precursor lesions, such as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSILs, also referred to as LSILs; CIN I and II or mild to moderate dysplasia), are found by colposcopy and biopsy, careful monitoring by frequent Pap smears or conservative treatment is possible. Conservative treatment may consist of monitoring, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cryotherapy:&lt;/b&gt; destruction of tissue by freezing (e.g., with liquid nitrogen)">cryotherapy</button></strong> (freezing with liquid nitrogen), or laser therapy. A <strong>loop electrocautery excision procedure (LEEP)</strong> may also be used to remove abnormal cells. In this procedure, a thin wire loop with laser is used to cut away a thin layer of cervical tissue. LEEP is an outpatient procedure that usually is performed in a gynecologist&#x2019;s office; it takes only a few minutes. Analgesia is given before the procedure, and a local anesthetic agent is injected into the area. This procedure allows the pathologist to examine the removed tissue sample to determine if the borders of the tissue are disease free. Another procedure referred to as a cone biopsy or conization (removing a cone-shaped portion of the cervix) is performed when biopsy findings demonstrate CIN III or HGSIL (equivalent to severe dysplasia) and carcinoma in situ.</p>
<p class="indent">If preinvasive cervical cancer (carcinoma in situ) occurs when a woman has completed childbearing, a simple hysterectomy (removal of the uterus only) is usually recommended (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). If a woman is pregnant or wishes to have children and invasion is less than 1 mm, conization may be sufficient. Frequent follow-up examinations are necessary to monitor for recurrence (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have precursor or premalignant lesions need reassurance that they do not have invasive cancer. However, the importance of close follow-up is emphasized because the condition, if untreated for a long time, may progress to cancer. Patients with cervical cancer in situ also need to know that this is usually a slow-growing and nonaggressive type of cancer that is not expected to recur after appropriate treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Invasive Cancer</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of invasive cervical cancer depends on the stage of the lesion, the patient&#x2019;s age and general health. Surgery and radiation treatment (intracavitary and external) are most often used. Surgical procedures that may be used to treat cervical cancer are summarized in <a href="#ct51-6">Chart&#x00A0;51-6</a>. Robot-assisted technology for the treatment of cervical cancer is a rapidly growing alternative to more invasive surgical options with decreased length of stay, recovery time, decreased blood loss, and increase in total number of retrievable lymph nodes (ACOG, 2017c).</p>

<p class="indent">Frequent follow-up after surgery is imperative because the risk of recurrence is high and usually occurs within the first 2 years. Recurrences are often in the upper quarter of the vagina, and ureteral obstruction may be a sign. Weight loss, leg edema, and pelvic pain may be signs of lymphatic obstruction and metastasis.</p>
<p class="indent">Radiation, which is often part of treatment to reduce recurrent disease, may be delivered by an external beam or by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;brachytherapy:&lt;/b&gt; delivery of radiation therapy through internal implants placed inside or adjacent to the tumor">brachytherapy</button></strong> (method by which the radiation source is placed near the tumor in a sealed source) or both. The field to be irradiated as well as the dose and method of radiation are determined by stage, volume of tumor, and lymph node involvement (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A variety of chemotherapeutic approaches are used to treat advanced cervical cancer. They are often used in combination with surgery and radiation. Vaginal stenosis is a frequent side effect of radiation. Preventive therapy (i.e., vaginal dilator) can be used to avoid severe permanent vaginal stenosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients with recurrences of cervical cancer are considered for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pelvic exenteration:&lt;/b&gt; major surgical procedure in which the pelvic organs are removed">pelvic exenteration</button></strong>, in which several pelvic organs are removed. This is a complex, extensive surgical procedure that is reserved for women with a high likelihood of cure. Unilateral leg edema, sciatica, and ureteral obstruction indicate likely disease progression. Patients with these symptoms have advanced disease and are not considered candidates for this major surgical procedure. Surgery is complex because it is performed close to the bowel, bladder, ureters, and great vessels. Possible complications include pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, hemorrhage, sepsis, small bowel obstruction, fistula formation, obstruction of the ileal conduit, bladder dysfunction, and pyelonephritis, most often in the first 18 months postoperatively. Vein constriction must be avoided postoperatively. Patients with varicose veins or a history of thromboembolic disease may be treated prophylactically with heparin. Anti-embolism stockings are prescribed to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Nursing care of these patients is complex and requires coordination and care by experienced health care professionals. Pelvic exenteration is discussed in further detail later in this chapter.</p>
