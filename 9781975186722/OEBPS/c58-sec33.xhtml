<p class="nonindent">Advancements in the treatment of diabetes have enabled patients to have a relatively a normal lifespan, but many have complications of long-term diabetes. One of the most serious complications of diabetes is retinopathy. Patients with diabetes are also at higher risk of cataracts and best practices for glycemic control during cataract surgery are not known (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4185">Kiziltoprak, Tekin, Inanc, et al., 2019</a>). See <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a> for a detailed discussion of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
