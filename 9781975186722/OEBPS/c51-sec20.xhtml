<p class="nonindent">Chronic pelvic pain is a common disorder of women that may be related to several of the previously discussed gynecologic disorders. Chronic pelvic pain is defined as noncyclic pain concentrated in the pelvis, anterior abdominal wall, and buttock or lumbosacral region for a period greater than 6&#x00A0;months (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Andrew &#x0026; Pickett, 2019</a>). Causes may be of reproductive, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal origin. A history of sexual abuse, IPV, PID, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, musculoskeletal disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and previous surgery resulting in abdominal adhesions may be associated with chronic pelvic pain. Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and lower abdominal pain may also be associated with sexual abuse and IPV.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic pelvic pain is often difficult to treat. Treatment depends on physical and diagnostic test results and may include antidepressant, analgesic, anxiolytic, and oral contraceptive agents; GnRH agonists; exercise; diet modification; and various surgical procedures (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Andrew &#x0026; Pickett, 2019</a>).</p>
