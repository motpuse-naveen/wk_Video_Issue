<h4 class="h4" id="s669">Pleural Effusion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pleural effusion, a collection of fluid in the pleural space, is rarely a primary disease process; it is usually secondary to other diseases. Normally, the pleural space contains a small amount of fluid (5 to 15 mL), which acts as a lubricant that allows the pleural surfaces to move without friction (see Fig.&#x00A0;19-4). Pleural effusion may be a complication of heart failure, TB, pneumonia, pulmonary infections (particularly viral infections), nephrotic syndrome, connective tissue disease, PE, and neoplastic tumors. The most common malignancy associated with a pleural effusion is bronchogenic carcinoma.</p>

Pleural effusion is usually secondary to other disease processes.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s670">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In certain disorders, fluid may accumulate in the pleural space to a point at which it becomes clinically evident. This almost always has pathologic significance. The effusion can be a relatively clear fluid, or it can be bloody or purulent. An effusion of clear fluid may be a transudate or an exudate. A transudate (filtrate of plasma that moves across intact capillary walls) occurs when factors influencing the formation and reabsorption of pleural fluid are altered, usually by imbalances in hydrostatic or oncotic pressures. The finding of a transudative effusion generally implies that the pleural membranes are not diseased. A transudative effusion most commonly results from heart failure. An exudate (extravasation of fluid into tissues or a cavity) usually results from inflammation by bacterial products or tumors involving the pleural surfaces (Heffner, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s671">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Usually, the clinical manifestations are caused by the underlying disease. Pneumonia causes fever, chills, and pleuritic chest pain, whereas a malignant effusion may result in dyspnea, difficulty lying flat, and coughing. The severity of symptoms is determined by the size of the effusion, the speed of its formation, and the underlying lung disease. A large pleural effusion causes dyspnea. A small-to-moderate pleural effusion causes minimal or no dyspnea.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s672">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the area of the pleural effusion reveals decreased or absent breath sounds; decreased fremitus; and a dull, flat sound on percussion. In the case of an extremely large pleural effusion, the assessment reveals a patient in acute respiratory distress. Tracheal deviation away from the affected side may also be apparent.</p>
<p class="indent">Physical examination, chest x-ray, chest CT, and thoracentesis confirm the presence of fluid. In some instances, a lateral decubitus x-ray is obtained. For this x-ray, the patient lies on the affected side in a side-lying position. A pleural effusion can be diagnosed because this position allows for the &#x201C;layering out&#x201D; of the fluid, and an air&#x2013;fluid line is visible.</p>
<p class="indent">Pleural fluid is analyzed by bacterial culture, Gram stain, AFB stain (for TB), red and white blood cell counts, chemistry studies (glucose, amylase, LDH, and protein), cytologic analysis for malignant cells, and pH. A pleural biopsy also may be performed as a diagnostic tool.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s673">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying cause of the pleural effusion; to prevent reaccumulation of fluid; and to relieve discomfort, dyspnea, and respiratory compromise. Specific treatment is directed at the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, pneumonia, cirrhosis). If the pleural fluid is an exudate, more extensive diagnostic procedures are performed to determine the cause. Treatment of the primary cause is then instituted.</p>
<p class="indent">Thoracentesis is performed to remove fluid, to obtain a specimen for analysis, and to relieve dyspnea and respiratory compromise (see <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>). Thoracentesis may be performed under ultrasound guidance. Depending on the size of the pleural effusion, the patient may be treated by removing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page555" title="555"></span>the fluid during the thoracentesis procedure or by inserting a chest tube connected to a water-seal drainage system or suction to evacuate the pleural space and re-expand the lung.</p>
<p class="indent">However, if the underlying cause is a malignancy, the effusion tends to recur within a few days or weeks. Repeated thoracenteses result in pain, depletion of protein and electrolytes, and sometimes pneumothorax. Once the pleural space is adequately drained, a chemical pleurodesis may be performed to obliterate the pleural space and prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Pleurodesis may be performed using either a thoracoscopic approach or a chest tube. A chemically irritating agent (e.g., talc or another chemical irritant) is instilled or aerosolized into the pleural space. With the chest tube approach, after the agent is instilled, the chest tube is clamped for 60 to 90 minutes and the patient is assisted to assume various positions to promote uniform distribution of the agent and to maximize its contact with the pleural surfaces (Heffner, 2019b). The tube is unclamped as prescribed, and chest drainage may be continued several days longer to prevent reaccumulation of fluid and to promote the formation of adhesions between the visceral and parietal pleurae.</p>
<p class="indent">Other treatments for pleural effusions caused by malignancy include surgical pleurectomy, insertion of a small catheter attached to a drainage bottle for outpatient management (e.g., PleurX<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> catheter), or implantation of a pleuroperitoneal shunt. A pleuroperitoneal shunt consists of two catheters connected by a pump chamber containing two one-way valves. Fluid moves from the pleural space to the pump chamber and then to the peritoneal cavity. The patient manually pumps on the reservoir daily to move fluid from the pleural space to the peritoneal space.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s674">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse&#x2019;s role in the care of a patient with a pleural effusion includes supporting the medical regimen. The nurse prepares and positions the patient for thoracentesis and offers support throughout the procedure. The nurse ensures the thoracentesis fluid amount is recorded and sent for appropriate laboratory testing. If a chest tube drainage and water-seal system is used, the system&#x2019;s function is monitored and the amount of drainage is recorded at prescribed intervals (see later discussion). Nursing care related to the underlying cause of the pleural effusion is specific to the underlying condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with a pleural effusion secondary to a malignancy may have a chest tube inserted to instill talc (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1468">Bhatnagar, Piotrowska, Laskawiec-Szkonter, et al., 2019</a>). Pain management is a priority, and the nurse helps the patient assume positions that are the least painful. However, frequent turning and movement are important to facilitate adequate spreading of the talc over the pleural surface. The nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s pain level and administers analgesic agents as prescribed and as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is to be managed as an outpatient with a pleural catheter for drainage, the nurse educates the patient and family about management and care of the catheter and drainage system.</p>
