<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;exostoses:&lt;/b&gt; small, hard, protrusions in the lower posterior bony portion of the ear canal">Exostoses</button></strong> are small, hard, bony protrusions found in the lower posterior bony portion of the ear canal; they usually occur bilaterally. The skin covering the exostosis is normal. It is believed that exostoses are caused by exposure to cold water, as in scuba diving or surfing. The usual treatment, if any, is surgical excision.</p>
<p class="indent">Malignant tumors also may occur in the external ear. Most common are basal cell carcinomas on the pinna and squamous cell carcinomas in the ear canal. If untreated, squamous cell carcinoma may spread through the temporal bone, causing facial nerve paralysis and hearing loss. Carcinomas must be treated surgically.</p>
