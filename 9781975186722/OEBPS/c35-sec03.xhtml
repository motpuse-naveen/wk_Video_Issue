<h5 class="h5" id="s1413">X-Ray Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bone x-rays determine bone density, texture, erosion, and changes in bone relationships. X-ray study of the cortex of the bone reveals any widening, narrowing, or signs of irregularity. Joint x-rays reveal fluid, irregularity, spur formation, narrowing, and changes in the joint structure. Multiple x-rays, with multiple views (e.g., anterior, posterior, lateral), are needed for full assessment of the structure being examined. Serial x-rays may be indicated to determine the status of the healing process (<a href="#bib2516">Kennedy-Malone et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1414">Computed Tomography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A computed tomography (CT) scan, which may be performed with or without the use of oral or intravenous (IV) contrast agents, shows a more detailed cross-sectional image of the body. It may be used to visualize and assess tumors; injury to the soft tissue, ligaments, or tendons; and severe trauma to the chest, abdomen, pelvis, head, or spinal cord. It is also used to identify the location and extent of fractures in areas that are difficult to evaluate (e.g., acetabulum) and not visible on x-ray (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1415">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create high-resolution pictures of bones and soft tissues. It can be used to visualize and assess torn muscles, ligaments, and cartilage; herniated discs; and a variety of hip or pelvic conditions. The patient does not experience any pain during the procedure. The MRI scanner is noisy, and it may take 30 to 90 minutes to complete the test. Because an electromagnet is used, patients with most metal implants (i.e., cochlear implants) or clips are not candidates for MRI (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Jewelry, hair clips, hearing aids, credit cards with magnetic strips, and other metal-containing objects must be removed before the MRI is performed; otherwise, they can become dangerous projectile objects or cause burns. Credit cards with magnetic strips may be erased, and nonremovable cochlear devices can become inoperable; therefore, their presence is a contraindication for MRI. In addition, transdermal patches (e.g., nicotine patch, nitroglycerin transdermal, scopolamine transdermal, clonidine transdermal) that have a thin layer of aluminized backing must be removed before MRI because they can cause burns. The primary provider should be notified before the patches are removed.</em></p></div>

<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1109</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1110" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1110">p. 1110</span></div>
<p class="indent">To enhance visualization of anatomic structures, an IV contrast agent may be used. Patients who experience claustrophobia may be unable to tolerate the confinement of closed MRI equipment without sedation. Open MRI systems are available, but they use lower-intensity magnetic fields, which produce lower-quality images. Advantages of open MRI include increased patient comfort, reduced problems with claustrophobic reactions, and reduced noise.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1416">Arthrography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Arthrography is used to identify the cause of any unexplained joint pain and progression of joint disease. A radiopaque contrast agent or air is injected into the joint cavity to visualize the joint structures, such as the ligaments, cartilage, tendons, and joint capsule. The joint is put through its range of motion to distribute the contrast agent while a series of x-rays are obtained. If a tear is present, the contrast agent leaks out of the joint and is evident on the x-ray image (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1417">Bone Densitometry</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bone densitometry is used to evaluate BMD. This can be performed through the use of x-rays or ultrasound. The most common modalities used include dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and quantitative ultrasound (QUS). DXA measures BMD and predicts fracture risk through accurate monitoring of bone density changes in patients with osteoporosis who are undergoing treatment. The density of bones in the spine, hip, and wrist may be calculated, as well as the total body. Peripheral dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) may be an alternative test that measures BMD of the forearm, finger, or heel, although its ability to project hip or spine fracture risk is less accurate than DXA (<a href="#bib2534">Felicilda-Reynaldo &#x0026; Kenneally, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone density may vary among different skeletal areas; therefore, BMD results may be normal at one site but low at another. Because these tests only measure density at specific sites, they may miss abnormal findings in other skeletal areas. Thus, although the BMD of the heel can be used to diagnose and monitor osteoporosis, predicting bone fracture risk related to osteoporosis is best achieved through DXA of the hip and spine. Hence, DXA is the most commonly prescribed diagnostic test for determining BMD (<a href="#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>). See <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for a further discussion of osteoporosis risks.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Before any of the imaging studies described previously (i.e., x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, arthrography, bone densitometry) are performed, the nurse prepares the patient. For all of these studies, the patient must lie still. During an MRI study, the patient may hear a knocking sound. In addition, the nurse assesses for conditions that may require special consideration during the study or that may be contraindications to the study (e.g., pregnancy; claustrophobia; inability to tolerate required positioning due to age, debility, or disability; metal implants). If contrast agents will be used for the CT scan, MRI, or arthrography, the patient is assessed for possible allergies (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient having an arthrogram may feel some discomfort or tingling during the procedure. After the arthrogram, a compression elastic bandage may be applied if prescribed, and the joint is usually rested for 12 hours. Strenuous activity should be avoided until approved by the primary provider. The nurse provides additional comfort measures (e.g., mild analgesia, ice) as appropriate and explains to the patient that it is normal to experience clicking or crackling in the joint for 24 to 48 hours after the procedure until the contrast agent or air is absorbed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1418">Bone Scan</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A bone scan is performed to detect metastatic and primary bone tumors, osteomyelitis, some fractures, and aseptic necrosis, and to monitor the progression of degenerative bone diseases. A bone scan may accurately identify bone disease before it can be detected on x-ray; as such, it may diagnose a stress fracture in a patient who continues to experience pain after x-ray findings are negative (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>). A bone scan requires the injection of a radioisotope through an IV line; the scan is performed 2 to 3 hours afterward. At this point, distribution and concentration of the isotope in the bone are measured. The degree of nuclide uptake is related to the metabolism of the bone; areas of abnormal bone formation will appear brighter. An increased uptake of the isotope is seen in primary skeletal disease (osteosarcoma), metastatic bone disease, inflammatory skeletal disease (osteomyelitis), and fractures that do not heal as expected.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to the bone scan, the nurse inquires about possible allergies to the radioisotope and assesses for any condition that would contraindicate performing the procedure (e.g., pregnancy, breast-feeding). The patient is educated about why the bone scan may be indicated and how it can assist in the identification of bone disease before it can be detected on an x-ray. The nurse should explain that the patient may experience moments of discomfort from the isotope (e.g., flushing, warmth) but provide reassurance that the radionuclide poses no radioactive hazard (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>). In addition, the patient is encouraged to drink plenty of fluids to help distribute and eliminate the isotope. Before the scan, the patient should empty the bladder, because a full bladder interferes with accurate scanning of the pelvic bones.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1419">Arthroscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Arthroscopy allows direct visualization of a joint through the use of a fiberoptic endoscope. Thus, it is a useful adjunct to diagnosing joint disorders. Biopsy and treatment of tears, defects, and disease processes may be performed through the arthroscope. The procedure takes place in the operating room under sterile conditions with either injection of a local anesthetic agent into the joint or general anesthesia. A large-bore needle is inserted, and the joint is distended with saline. The arthroscope is introduced, and joint structures, synovium, and articular surfaces are visualized. After the procedure, the puncture wound is closed with adhesive strips or sutures and covered with a sterile dressing. Complications are rare but may include infection, hemarthrosis, neurovascular compromise, thrombophlebitis, stiffness, effusion, adhesions, and delayed wound healing (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1110</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1111" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1111">p. 1111</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the arthroscopic procedure, the joint is wrapped with a compression dressing to control swelling. In addition, ice may be applied to control edema and enhance comfort. Frequently, the joint is kept extended and elevated to reduce swelling. The nurse monitors and documents the neurovascular status (see <a href="#ct35-4">Chart 35-4</a>). Analgesic agents are given as needed. The patient is instructed to avoid strenuous activity of the joint, and exercises must be approved by the primary provider. The patient and family are instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms of complications (e.g., fever, excessive bleeding, swelling, numbness, cool skin) and the importance of notifying the primary provider should any of these occur (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1420">Arthrocentesis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) is carried out to obtain synovial fluid for purposes of examination or to relieve pain due to effusion. Examination of synovial fluid is helpful in the diagnosis of septic arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies and reveals the presence of hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint cavity), which suggests trauma or a bleeding disorder. Normally, synovial fluid is clear, pale, straw colored, and scanty in volume. Using aseptic technique, the primary provider inserts a needle into the joint and aspirates fluid. Anti-inflammatory medications may be injected into the joint. A sterile dressing is applied after aspiration. There is a risk of infection after this procedure (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should review the procedure with the patient and its indications. Hair may need to be removed from the site before the procedure. Pain may be a concern; telling the patient that antispasmodic agents may be given to alleviate discomfort during the procedure may help decrease anxiety. Ice may be prescribed for the first 24 to 48 hours postprocedure; the patient should be educated about why ice may be indicated (i.e., to diminish edema formation and pain). If antibiotics are prescribed postprocedure, the patient must be educated about their use and reminded to take medications as prescribed. The patient and family are educated about the possible signs and symptoms of complications, particularly infection and bleeding (e.g., fever, excessive bleeding, swelling, numbness, cool skin) and the importance of promptly notifying the primary provider if any of these occur (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1421">Electromyography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Electromyography (EMG) provides information about the electrical potential of the muscles and the nerves leading to them. The test is performed to evaluate muscle weakness, pain, and disability. The purpose of the procedure is to determine any abnormality of function and to differentiate muscle and nerve problems. An EMG can be used to identify the extent of damage if nerve function does not return within 4 months of an injury. Needle electrodes are inserted into selected muscles, and responses to electrical stimuli are recorded on an oscilloscope. Warm compresses may relieve residual discomfort after the study.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Before the patient undergoes an EMG, the nurse inquires if the patient is taking any anticoagulant medications and assesses for any active skin infection. If the patient is found to be taking an anticoagulant or has a skin infection, the primary provider is notified. An EMG is usually contraindicated in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin) because the needle electrodes may cause bleeding within the muscle. EMG also may be contraindicated in patients with extensive skin infections due to the risk of spreading infection from the skin to the muscle. The nurse instructs the patient to avoid using any lotions or creams on the day of the test (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1422">Biopsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Biopsy may be performed to determine the structure and composition of bone marrow, bone, muscle, or synovium to help diagnose specific diseases. It involves excising a sample of tissue that can be analyzed microscopically to determine cell morphology and tissue abnormalities.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient about the procedure and offers assurance that analgesic agents will be provided. The biopsy site is monitored for edema, bleeding, pain, hematoma formation, and infection. Ice is applied as prescribed to control bleeding and edema. In addition, antibiotics and analgesic agents are given as prescribed. The patient is instructed to report signs of redness, bleeding, or pain at the biopsy site as well as fever or chills to the primary provider (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1423">Laboratory Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Examination of the patient&#x2019;s blood and urine is used to identify the presence and amount of chemicals and other substances. The results may indicate a primary musculoskeletal problem (e.g., Paget&#x2019;s disease of the bone), a developing complication (e.g., infection), the baseline for instituting therapy (e.g., anticoagulant therapy), or the response to therapy, as well as possible causes of bone loss. Before surgery, coagulation studies are performed to detect bleeding tendencies (because bone is vascular tissue).</p>
<p class="indent">Serum calcium levels are altered in patients with osteomalacia, parathyroid dysfunction, Paget&#x2019;s disease, metastatic bone tumors, or prolonged immobilization. Serum phosphorus levels are inversely related to calcium levels and are diminished in osteomalacia associated with malabsorption syndrome. Acid phosphatase is elevated in Paget&#x2019;s disease and metastatic cancer. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated during early fracture healing and in diseases with increased osteoblastic activity (e.g., metastatic bone tumors). Bone metabolism may be evaluated through thyroid studies and determination of calcitonin, PTH, and vitamin D levels. Serum enzyme levels of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase become elevated with muscle damage. Serum osteocalcin indicates the rate of bone turnover. Urine calcium levels increase with bone destruction (e.g., parathyroid dysfunction, metastatic bone tumors, multiple myeloma) (<a href="#bib2519">Van Leeuwen &#x0026; Bladh, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Specific urine and serum biochemical markers can be used to provide information about the speed of bone resorption or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1112" title="1112"></span>bone formation, as well as to document the effects of therapeutic interventions prescribed for patients diagnosed with musculoskeletal disorders. These include urinary <em>N</em>-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpd), both of which reflect increased osteoclast activity and increased bone resorption. Conversely, elevated serum levels of bone-specific ALP, osteocalcin, and intact <em>N</em>-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) reflect increased activity of osteoblasts and enhanced bone remodeling activity (NOF, 2019).</p>
