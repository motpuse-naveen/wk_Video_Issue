<h4 class="h4" id="s2365">Pelvic Organ Prolapse: Cystocele, Rectocele, Enterocele</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Age and parity can put strain on the ligaments and structures that make up the female pelvis and pelvic floor. Childbirth can result in tears of the levator sling musculature, resulting in structural weakness. Hormone deficiency also may play a role. Some degree of prolapse (weakening of the vaginal walls allowing the pelvic organs to descend and protrude into the vaginal canal) may be found in older women. Risk factors include age, parity (particularly vaginal delivery), menopause, previous pelvic surgery, and possibly a genetic predisposition (ACOG, 2017b; Casanova et al., 2019).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cystocele:&lt;/b&gt; a bulge caused by the bladder protruding into the vagina">Cystocele</button></strong> is a downward displacement of the bladder toward the vaginal orifice (see <a href="#ff51-3">Fig.&#x00A0;51-3</a>) from damage to the anterior vaginal support structures. It usually results from injury and strain during childbirth. The condition usually appears years later when genital atrophy associated with aging occurs, but younger women who are multiparous and premenopausal may also be affected.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rectocele:&lt;/b&gt; bulging of the rectum into the vagina">Rectocele</button></strong> is an upward pouching of the rectum that pushes the posterior wall of the vagina forward. Both rectoceles and perineal lacerations, which occur because of muscle tears below the vagina, may affect the muscles and tissues of the pelvic floor and may occur during childbirth. Sometimes, the lacerations may completely sever the fibers of the anal sphincter (complete tear). An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;enterocele:&lt;/b&gt; a protrusion of the intestinal wall into the vagina">enterocele</button></strong> is a protrusion of the intestinal wall into the vagina. Prolapse results from a weakening of the support structures of the uterus itself; the cervix drops and may protrude from the vagina. If complete prolapse occurs (cervix descending beyond vulva), it may also be referred to as procidentia.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2366">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because a cystocele causes the anterior vaginal wall to bulge downward, the patient may report a sense of pelvic pressure and urinary problems such as incontinence, frequency, and urgency. Back pain and pelvic pain may occur as well. The symptoms of rectocele resemble those of cystocele, with one exception: Instead of urinary symptoms, patients may experience rectal pressure. Constipation, uncontrollable gas, and fecal incontinence may occur in patients with complete tears. Prolapse can result in feelings of pressure and ulcerations and bleeding. Dyspareunia may occur with these disorders.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2367">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Kegel exercises, which involve contracting or tightening the vaginal muscles, are prescribed to help strengthen these weakened muscles (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Good &#x0026; Solomon, 2019</a>). The exercises are more effective in the early stages of a cystocele. Kegel exercises are easy to perform and are recommended for all women, including those with strong pelvic floor muscles (see <a href="#ct51-4">Chart&#x00A0;51-4</a>). Pelvic floor PT is another treatment option for early-stage pelvic organ prolapse. It often requires multiple visits and use of manometers and internal examinations, which can be distressing to some (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Good &#x0026; Solomon, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Performing Kegel (Pelvic Muscle) Exercises</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>Purposes:</em> To strengthen and maintain the tone of the pubococcygeal muscle, which supports the pelvic organs; reduce or prevent stress incontinence and uterine prolapse; enhance sensation during penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse; and hasten postpartum healing.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah_b">1.</span>Become aware of pelvic muscle function by &#x201C;drawing in&#x201D; the perivaginal muscles and anal sphincter as if to control urine or defecation, but not contracting the abdominal, buttock, or inner thigh muscles.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah_b">2.</span>Sustain contraction of the muscles for up to 10 seconds, followed by at least 10 seconds of relaxation.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Last"><span class="numah_b">3.</span>Perform these exercises 30&#x2013;80 times a day.</p>

<p class="indent">A pessary can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments to avoid surgery (ACOG, 2017b; Good &#x0026; Solomon, 2019). This device is inserted into the vagina and positioned to keep an organ, such as the bladder, uterus, or intestine, properly aligned when a cystocele, rectocele, or prolapse has occurred. Pessaries are usually ring- or doughnut shaped and are made of various materials, such as rubber or plastic (see <a href="c51-sec13.xhtml#ff51-4">Fig.&#x00A0;51-4</a>). Rubber pessaries must be avoided in women with latex allergy. The size and type of pessary are selected and fitted by a gynecologic health care provider. The patient should have the pessary removed, examined, and cleaned by her health care provider at prescribed intervals. At these checkups, vaginal walls should be examined for pressure points or signs of irritation. Normally, the patient experiences no pain, discomfort, or discharge with a pessary, but if chronic irritation, excessive discharge, or bleeding occur, alternative measures may be needed (ACOG, 2017b; Good &#x0026; Solomon, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">A Colpexin Sphere is another nonsurgical device used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. This intravaginal device is similar to a pessary, but it supports the pelvic floor muscles and facilitates exercise of these muscles. It is removed daily for cleaning.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In many cases, surgery helps correct structural abnormalities. The procedure to repair the anterior vaginal wall is called anterior colporrhaphy, repair of a rectocele is referred to as a posterior colporrhaphy, and repair of perineal lacerations is called a perineorrhaphy. These repairs are frequently performed laparoscopically, resulting in short hospital lengths of stay and good outcomes. A laparoscope is inserted through a small abdominal incision, the pelvis is visualized, and surgical repairs are performed. Transvaginal surgical mesh as a treatment option has been associated with the complications of vaginal erosion, pain and infection leading to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordering manufacturers of surgical mesh to stop selling and distributing these products (FDA, 2019).</p>
