<h4 class="h4" id="s2398">Cancer of the Uterus (Endometrium)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Over the last decade there has been an increase in both the incidence and death rates of cancer of the uterine endometrium (fundus or corpus), possibly because of increased lifespan and coexisting comorbidities. This cancer is the most frequently occurring gynecologic cancer in the United States. After breast, lung, and colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. Most women are diagnosed after menopause, with only 15% diagnosed before age 50 (ACOG, 2019). Many women with endometrial cancer have obesity, which increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from this disease. Cumulative exposure to estrogen is considered the major risk factor (see <a href="#ct51-7">Chart&#x00A0;51-7</a>). This exposure occurs with the use of estrogen therapy without the use of progestin, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, and anovulation. Other risk factors include infertility, diabetes, and the use of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen, which is taken for treatment or prevention of breast cancer, may cause proliferation of the uterine lining (ACOG, 2019). Women who take tamoxifen should be monitored by their oncologists and/or gynecologic health care providers.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2399">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most uterine cancers are endometrioid (i.e., originating in the lining of the uterus). There are two types. Type 1, which accounts for about 90% of cases, is estrogen dependent. It is usually low grade with a favorable prognosis. Type 2, which occurs in about 10% of cases, is high grade and usually serous cell or clear cell. Type 2 is considered to be estrogen independent. Older and African American women are at higher risk for type 2 (ACOG, 2019; <a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2400">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All women should be encouraged to have annual checkups, including a gynecologic examination. Any woman who is experiencing irregular bleeding should be evaluated promptly. If a menopausal woman experiences bleeding, an endometrial aspiration or biopsy is performed to rule out hyperplasia, which is a possible precursor of endometrial cancer. The procedure is quick and usually not painful. Transvaginal ultrasound can also be used to measure the thickness of the endometrium (ACOG, 2019). (Women who are postmenopausal should have a very thin endometrium due to low levels of estrogen; a thicker lining warrants further investigation.) A biopsy or aspiration for tissue pathology is diagnostic.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2401">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment for endometrial cancer consists of surgical staging, total or radical hysterectomy (discussed later in this chapter), and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lymph node sampling. Laparoscopy or a robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery is less invasive than abdominal surgery (ACOG, 2019). Lymph node sampling and visualization of the peritoneum can be accomplished in many women in this manner. Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) levels must be monitored, because elevated levels are a significant predictor of extrauterine disease or metastasis. Depending on the stage, the therapeutic approach is individualized and is based on stage, type, differentiation, degree of invasion, and node involvement. Radiation may be used in the form of external-beam radiation or vaginal brachytherapy (ACOG, 2019). Whole pelvis radiotherapy may be used if there is any spread beyond the uterus. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1698" title="1698"></span>Recurrent cancer usually occurs inside the vaginal vault or in the upper vagina, and metastasis usually occurs in lymph nodes or the ovary. Recurrent lesions in the vagina are treated with surgery and radiation. Recurrent lesions beyond the vagina are treated with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Progestin therapy is used frequently. Patients should be prepared for such side effects as nausea, depression, rash, or mild fluid retention with progestin therapy.</p>
