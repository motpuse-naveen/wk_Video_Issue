<h4 class="h4" id="s3049">Multiple Sclerosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">MS is an immune-mediated, progressive demyelinating disease of the CNS. Demyelination refers to the destruction of myelin&#x2014;the fatty and protein material that surrounds certain nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord; it results in impaired transmission of nerve impulses (see <a href="#ff64-3">Fig.&#x00A0;64-3</a>). MS <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2095" title="2095"></span>affects nearly 400,000 people in the United States (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>). MS may occur at any age, but the age of peak onset is between 20 and 50 years; it affects women three times more than men (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The cause of MS is unknown and is an area of ongoing research. Autoimmune activity results in demyelination, but the sensitized antigen has not been identified. Multiple factors play a role in the initiation of the immune process. Geographic prevalence is highest in Europe, New Zealand, southern Australia, the northern United States, and southern Canada. MS is less prevalent in Asians. There is a greater frequency in northern colder latitudes (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">MS is considered to have many risks, including genetic factors. It has not been found to be genetically transmitted but there have been 200 genetic variations related to MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A specific virus capable of initiating the autoimmune response has not been identified. It is believed that DNA on the virus mimics the amino acid sequence of myelin, resulting in an immune system cross-reaction in the presence of a defective immune system. Environmental risks include obesity, lack of vitamin D exposure, and a high salt diet in the teenage years (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are several acute and subacute forms of MS. Less severe forms include radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). RIS consists of MS-like lesions that are identified on MRI in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. Approximately one third of patients are diagnosed with MS within 5 years of the identification of an incidental lesion on MRI (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>). CIS is the presence of acute or subacute clinical findings for at least 24 hours (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The four main clinical forms are remitting-relapsing (RRMS), secondary progressive, primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive-relapsing (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Bradshaw &#x0026; Houtchens, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3050">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sensitized T and B lymphocytes cross the blood&#x2013;brain barrier; their function is to check the CNS for antigens and then leave. In MS, sensitized T cells remain in the CNS and promote the infiltration of other agents that damage the immune system. The immune system attack leads to inflammation that destroys mostly the white matter of the CNS myelin (which insulates the axon and speeds the conduction of impulses along the axon) and the oligodendroglial cells that produce myelin in the CNS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Demyelination interrupts the flow of nerve impulses and results in a variety of manifestations, depending on the nerves affected. Plaques appear on demyelinated axons, further interrupting the transmission of impulses. Demyelinated axons are scattered irregularly throughout the CNS. The areas most frequently affected are the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts; the cerebrum; the brainstem and cerebellum; and the spinal cord (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>). The axons themselves begin to degenerate, resulting in permanent and irreversible damage.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3051">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The course of MS assumes many different patterns. In some patients, the disease follows a benign course, and symptoms are so mild that the patient does not seek health care or treatment. The patient with RIS will have no symptoms, while the typical presentation of CIS includes unilateral optic neuritis, focal symptoms, or partial myelopathy (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately 85% of patients have RRMS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>). With each relapse, recovery is usually complete; however, residual deficits may occur and accumulate over time, contributing to functional decline. Over time, most patients with RRMS move to the secondary progressive form, in which disease progression occurs with or without relapses. Approximately 15% of patients have PPMS, in which disabling symptoms steadily increase, with rare plateaus and temporary minor improvement. PPMS may result in quadriparesis, cognitive dysfunction, visual loss, and brainstem syndromes (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>). The least common presentation (about 5% of cases) is progressive-relapsing, which is characterized by relapses with continuous disabling progression between exacerbations (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>; <a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>). The signs and symptoms of MS are varied and multiple, reflecting the location of the lesion (plaque) or combination of lesions. Physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms impact the quality of life (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4458">Debska, Milaniak, &#x0026; Skorupska-Krol, 2020</a>; <a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4461">Kalb, Feinstein, Rohrig, et al., 2019</a>). Fatigue, depression, weakness, numbness, difficulty in coordination, loss of balance, spasticity, and pain are all common (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>). Visual disturbances due to lesions in the optic nerves or their connections may include blurring of vision, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diplopia:&lt;/b&gt; seeing one object as two (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; double vision)">diplopia</button></strong> (double vision, or the awareness of two images of the same object occurring in one or both eyes), scotoma (patchy blindness), and total blindness.</p>
<p class="indent">Fatigue affects most people with MS and is often the most disabling symptom (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4469">Newland, Lorenz, Smith, et al., 2019</a>). Heat, depression, anemia, deconditioning, and medication may contribute to fatigue. Avoiding hot temperatures, effective treatment of depression and anemia, a change in medication, as well as occupational and physical therapies may help manage fatigue (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Pain is another common symptom of MS. Lesions on the sensory pathways cause pain. Additional sensory manifestations include paresthesias, dysesthesias, and proprioception loss. Many people with MS need daily analgesic medications. In some cases, pain is managed with opioids, anticonvulsant medications, or antidepressants. Rarely, surgery may be needed to interrupt pain pathways.</p>
<p class="indent">Among women who are perimenopausal, those with MS are more likely to have pain related to osteoporosis. In addition to estrogen loss, immobility and corticosteroid therapy play a role in the development of osteoporosis among women with MS. Bone mineral density testing is recommended for this high-risk group. See <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for a discussion of the diagnosis of and treatment for osteoporosis.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spasticity:&lt;/b&gt; sustained increase in tension of a muscle when it is passively lengthened or stretched">Spasticity</button></strong> is characterized by muscle hypertonicity with increased resistance to stretch often associated with weakness, increased deep tendon reflexes, and diminished superficial reflexes. It occurs in 90% of patients with MS, most often in the lower extremities, and can include loss of the abdominal reflexes. Spasticity results from involvement of the pyramidal tracts, the main motor pathways of the spinal cord. Cognitive and psychosocial problems may reflect frontal or parietal lobe involvement. Some degree of cognitive change (e.g., memory loss, decreased concentration) occurs in about half of patients, but severe cognitive changes with dementia (progressive organic mental disorder) are rare.</p>
<p class="indent">Involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia can produce ataxia and tremor. Loss of the control connections <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2096" title="2096"></span>between the cortex and the basal ganglia may occur and cause emotional lability and euphoria. Bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunctions are common. Additional complications include urinary tract infections (UTIs), constipation, pressure injury, contracture deformities, dependent pedal edema, pneumonia, and osteoporosis. Emotional, social, marital, economic, and vocational problems may also occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Exacerbations and remissions are characteristic of MS. During exacerbations, new symptoms appear and existing ones worsen; during remissions, symptoms decrease or disappear. Relapses may be associated with emotional and physical stress.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3052"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The life expectancy for patients with MS is 7 to 14 years shorter than patients without MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>). Those diagnosed with secondary progressive disease live an average of 38 years after onset. Older adult patients with MS have specific physical and psychosocial challenges. They may have chronic health problems, for which they may be taking additional medications that could interact with medications prescribed for MS. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medications are altered in the older adult as a result of age-related changes in kidney and liver functions. Therefore, older adult patients must be monitored closely for adverse and toxic effects of MS medications and for osteoporosis (particularly if corticosteroids have been used frequently to treat exacerbations). The cost of medications may lead to poor adherence to the prescribed regimen in older adult patients on fixed incomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Older adult patients with MS are particularly concerned about increasing disability, family burden, marital concern, and the possible future need for nursing home care. Immobility resulting in fewer social opportunities contributes to loneliness and depression. In addition to functional loss, the physical challenges experienced by older adults with MS include spasticity, pain, bladder dysfunction, impaired sleep, and an increased need for assistance with self-care.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3053">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of MS is based on clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings. An important component is the presence of plaques in the CNS disseminated in space and over time observed on MRI scans with no better explanation for the clinical presentation (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4474">Thompson, Banwell, Barkhof, et al., 2018</a>). Additional criteria are detailed in <a href="#tt64-2">Table&#x00A0;64-2</a>. Electrophoresis of CSF identifies the presence of oligoclonal banding (several bands of immunoglobulin G bonded together, indicating an immune system abnormality) (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Thompson et al., 2018</a>). Evoked potential studies can help define the extent of the disease process and monitor changes (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>). Underlying bladder dysfunction is diagnosed by urodynamic studies. Neuropsychological testing may be indicated to assess cognitive impairment. A sexual history helps identify changes in sexual function.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3054">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is no cure for MS. An individual treatment program is indicated to relieve symptoms and provide continuing support, particularly for patients with cognitive changes, who may need more structure and support. The goals of treatment are to delay the progression of the disease, manage chronic symptoms, and treat acute exacerbations. Common symptoms <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2097" title="2097"></span>requiring intervention include ataxia, bladder dysfunction, depression, fatigue, and spasticity. Management includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies.</p>

<p class="bfoot">If the 2017 McDonald Criteria are fulfilled and there is no better explanation for the clinical presentation, the diagnosis is multiple sclerosis. If multiple sclerosis is suspected by virtue of a clinically isolated syndrome but the 2017 McDonald Criteria are not completely met, the diagnosis is possible multiple sclerosis. If another diagnosis arises during the evaluation that better explains the clinical presentation, the diagnosis is not multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p class="bfoot0"><sup><em><a id="ftn1" href="#ftn1a">a</a></em></sup>No additional tests are required to demonstrate dissemination in space and time. However, unless MRI is not possible, brain MRI should be obtained in all patients in whom the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is being considered. In addition, spinal cord MRI or CSF examination should be considered in patients with insufficient clinical and MRI evidence supporting multiple sclerosis, with a presentation other than a typical clinically isolated syndrome, or with atypical features. If imaging or other tests (e.g., CSF) are undertaken and are negative, caution needs to be taken before making a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and alternative diagnoses should be considered.</p>
<p class="bfoot0"><sup><em><a id="ftn2" href="#ftn2a">b</a></em></sup>Clinical diagnosis based on objective clinical findings for two attacks is most secure. Reasonable historical evidence for one past attack, in the absence of documented objective neurologic findings, can include historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristic for a previous inflammatory demyelinating attack; at least one attack, however, must be supported by objective findings. In the absence of residual objective evidence, caution is needed.</p>
<p class="bfoot0"><sup><em><a id="ftn3" href="#ftn3a">c</a></em></sup>The presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands does not demonstrate dissemination in time per se but can substitute for the requirement for demonstration of this measure.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medications prescribed for MS include those for disease modification and those for symptom management. Disease-modifying therapies delay disease progression in many forms of MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4471">Rae-Grant, Day, Marrie, et al., 2018</a>). Many types of medications are used for symptom management in MS.</p>
<p class="h7">Disease-Modifying Therapies</p>
<p class="nonindent">In the past decade, the number of disease-modifying therapies has increased dramatically (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Bradshaw &#x0026; Houtchens, 2018</a>). The key concept of disease-modifying therapies is to reduce the frequency of relapse, the duration of relapse, and the number and size of plaques observed on MRI in RRMS; however, these therapies are not effective in PPMS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). There is debate about whether to use disease-modifying therapies in patients with RIS to prevent future disease progression to MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>; <a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Rae-Grant et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are administered subcutaneously every other day. Another preparation of interferon beta-1a may be given intramuscularly once a week and pegylated interferon beta-1a can be given subcutaneously every 14 days. Side effects of all interferon-beta medications include flulike symptoms, increased liver function tests, leukopenia, headache, depression, and skin necrosis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Coyle, 2019</a>). For optimal control of disability, disease-modifying medications should be started early in the course of the disease (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Rae-Grant et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Glatiramer acetate also reduces the rate of relapse in RRMS and is administered subcutaneously daily. It has some adverse effects, such as injection-site reactions and flushing, but these are usually self-limiting to a few minutes. There are no monitoring parameters (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Bradshaw &#x0026; Houtchens, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Teriflunomide, fingolimod, and dimethyl fumarate are oral disease-modifying therapies that may be better tolerated by the patient who has difficulty with injection reactions. These medications have significantly reduced relapse rates in several types of MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Bradshaw &#x0026; Houtchens, 2018</a>). Ocrelizumab has a 6% annual relapse reduction rate in patients with PPMS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Bradshaw &#x0026; Houtchens, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">IV methylprednisolone, used to treat acute exacerbations, shortens the duration of relapse but has not been found to have long-term benefit (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Bradshaw &#x0026; Houtchens, 2018</a>). It exerts anti-inflammatory effects by acting on T cells and cytokines. The medication is given as 1 g IV daily for 3 to 5 days, followed by an oral taper of prednisone. Side effects include mood swings, weight gain, and electrolyte imbalances (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The medication mitoxantrone is given via IV infusion every 3 months. Mitoxantrone can reduce the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary progressive or worsening RRMS. Patients must be very closely monitored for side effects (i.e., cardiac toxicity), and there is a maximum lifetime dose that can be given (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Symptom Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Medications are also prescribed for management of specific symptoms. Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, is the medication of choice for treating spasticity. It can be given orally or by intrathecal injection for severe spasticity (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), tizanidine, and dantrolene may also be used to treat spasticity and improve motor function (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Patients with disabling spasms and contractures may require nerve blocks or surgical intervention. Fatigue that interferes with activities of daily living (ADLs) may be treated with amantadine, pemoline, or dalfampridine. Ataxia is a chronic problem most resistant to treatment. Medications used to treat ataxia include beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g., propranolol), the anticonvulsant agent gabapentin, and benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam).</p>
<p class="indent">Bladder and bowel problems are often difficult for patients, and a variety of medications (anticholinergic agents, alpha-adrenergic blockers, antispasmodic agents) may be prescribed. Nonpharmacologic strategies also assist in establishing effective bowel and bladder elimination.</p>
<p class="indent">UTI may be superimposed on the underlying neurologic dysfunction. Increased fluid intake and good perineal care help reduce the risk of UTI. Antibiotic agents are prescribed when appropriate. See <a href="c49.xhtml">Chapter 49</a> for further discussion of UTI management.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include promotion of physical mobility, avoidance of falls, decreasing fatigue, development of coping strategies, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">An individualized program of physical, occupational, and speech-language therapy, rehabilitation, and education is combined with emotional support. An educational plan of care is developed to enable the person with MS to deal with the physiologic, social, and psychological problems that accompany chronic disease. The presence of depression, pain, fatigue, and walking difficulty all decrease physical activity. Assisting patients with management of these symptoms may help increase the level of physical activity and overall sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">P<small>ROMOTING</small> P<small>HYSICAL</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Relaxation and coordination exercises promote muscle efficiency. Progressive resistive exercises are used to strengthen weak muscles, because diminishing muscle strength is often significant in MS.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Exercise.</span> Walking improves the gait, particularly the problem of loss of position sense of the legs and feet. If certain muscle groups are irreversibly affected, other muscles can be trained to compensate. Instruction in the use of assistive devices may be needed to ensure their safe and correct use.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Minimizing Spasticity and Contractures.</span> Muscle spasticity is common and, in its later stages, is characterized by severe adductor spasm of the hips with flexor spasm of the hips and knees. Without relief, fibrous contractures of these joints occur. Warm packs may be beneficial, but hot baths should be avoided because of risk of burn injury secondary to sensory loss and increasing symptoms that may occur with elevation of the body temperature. Exposure to extreme cold is avoided as this may increase spasticity.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Daily exercises for muscle stretching are prescribed to minimize joint contractures. Special attention is given to the hamstrings, gastrocnemius muscles, hip adductors, biceps, and wrist and finger flexors. Muscle spasticity is common and interferes with usual function. Application of prescribed orthotics may help maintain a functional position and reduce contractures. A stretch&#x2013;hold&#x2013;relax routine is helpful for relaxing and treating muscle spasticity. Swimming and stationary bicycling are useful, and progressive weight bearing can relieve spasticity in the legs. The patient should not be hurried in any of these activities, because this often increases spasticity.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Activity and Rest.</span> The patient is encouraged to work and exercise to a point just short of fatigue. Very strenuous physical exercise is not advisable, because it raises the body temperature and may aggravate symptoms. The patient is advised to take frequent short rest periods. Exposure to heat increases fatigue and muscle weakness, so air conditioning is recommended in at least one room.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="h4a"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiii-3.jpg" alt=""/> Nutrition.</span> Similar to the population at large, many patients with MS are overweight or have obesity. Contributing factors include the use of corticosteroids for exacerbations of symptoms and mobility impairments as a result of the disease. Interventions to promote healthy eating and weight reduction need to take into account that fatigue and mobility impairments are barriers to engagement in nutritional behaviors for people with MS. Nurses also need to be certain to include family members in interventions and nutrition education, because they are often the gatekeepers for food preparation and selection. Additional strategies include avoidance of alcohol and cigarette smoking.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">P<small>REVENTING</small> F<small>ALLS</small></p>
<p class="processppara">If motor dysfunction causes problems of incoordination and clumsiness, or if ataxia is apparent, then the patient is at risk for falls. To overcome this risk, the patient is instructed to walk with feet apart to widen the base of support and to increase walking stability. If loss of position sense occurs, the patient is instructed to watch their feet while walking. Gait training may require assistive devices (walker, cane, braces, crutches, parallel bars) and instruction about their use by a physical therapist. If the gait remains inefficient, a wheelchair or motorized scooter may be the solution. The occupational therapist is a valuable resource person in suggesting and securing aids to promote independence. If incoordination is a problem and tremor of the upper extremities occurs when voluntary movement is attempted (intention tremor), weighted wrist weights or neuromodulation devices may be used. The patient is trained in transfer and ADLs.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because sensory loss may occur in addition to motor loss, pressure injuries are a continuing threat to skin integrity. The need to use a wheelchair continuously increases the risk. See <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a> for a discussion of the prevention and treatment of pressure injury.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">M<small>ANAGING</small> F<small>ATIGUE</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Fatigue is a common symptom reported in 60% to 90% of those with MS, but the etiology remains unclear. It is often the most disabling symptom and the most common reason patients cease employment (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4469">Newland et al., 2019</a>). Many factors contribute to fatigue and the nurse helps the patient identify risks and ameliorate those that lead to fatigue. Research that identified the relationships among MS-related symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality in adults with MS who report fatigue suggests that decreasing the use of electronic devices prior to sleep can improve sleep quality and lessen fatigue (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4469">Newland et al., 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct64-2">Chart&#x00A0;64-2</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">S<small>TRENGTHENING</small> C<small>OPING</small> M<small>ECHANISMS</small></p>
<p class="processppara">The diagnosis of MS is distressing to the patient and family. They need to know that no two patients with MS have identical symptoms or courses of illness. Although some patients do experience significant disability, others have a near-normal lifespan with minimal disability. Some families, however, face acute frustrations and problems. MS affects people who are often in an early stage of life and concerned about career and family responsibilities. Family conflict, disintegration, separation, and divorce are not uncommon. Often, young family members assume the responsibility of caring for a parent with MS. Nursing interventions in this area include assisting patients and families to manage or reduce stress and making appropriate referrals for counseling and support to minimize the adverse effects of dealing with chronic illness.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>The Relationship Between MS and Sleep</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Newland, P., Lorenz, R. A., Smith, J. M., et al. (2019). The relationship among multiple sclerosis-related symptoms, sleep quality, and sleep hygiene behaviors. <em>Journal of Neuroscience Nursing</em>, <em>51</em>(1), 37&#x2013;42.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Fatigue is common among those with MS and has a negative impact on many aspects of their lives. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among MS-related symptoms, sleep hygiene behaviors, and sleep quality in adults with MS who report fatigue.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a descriptive correlational study with a convenience sample of 39 community dwelling adults with MS. Data were collected about demographic characteristics. Measures used to collect data included the revised MS-Related Symptom Scale, the patient self-report version of the Expanded Disability Status Scale, a single item sleep quality scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a sleep behavior self-rating scale.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The mean age of participants was 45 years; 80% reported having RRMS and 20% reported PPMS. High levels of forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating were significantly correlated with poor sleep quality. Fatigue was higher in those who used electronic devices around bedtime and practiced poor sleep hygiene behaviors. Pain, a frequent symptom in those with MS, was not significantly related to sleep quality.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses working with patients with MS should incorporate interventions for symptoms, particularly forgetfulness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, as they significantly impact sleep. Education should include the recommendation to remove electronic devices from the bedroom, and to restrict the use of technology in the hours prior to sleep.</p>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse, mindful of these complex problems, initiates home care and coordinates a network of services, including social services, speech therapy, physical therapy, and homemaker services. To strengthen the patient&#x2019;s coping skills, as much information as possible is provided. Patients need a list of available assistive devices, services, and resources.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Coping through problem solving involves helping the patient define the problem and develop alternatives for its management. Planning carefully, maintaining flexibility, and preserving a hopeful attitude are useful for psychological and physical adaptation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Complications that can occur with MS are caused by damage to the myelin in the CNS. The nurse monitors for the presence of cognitive changes, how the patient is able to manage at home, or changes in sexuality. Cognitive changes or inability to manage prescribed therapies at home may be due to psychological effects of MS. The patient is monitored for the risk of suicide as 50% of patients with MS experience major depression and the suicide rate is twice that of the general population (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Kalb et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="h4a"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> As the disease progresses, the patient and family need to learn new strategies to maintain optimal independence. Educating about self-care techniques may be initiated in the hospital or clinic setting and reinforced in the home. Self-care education may address the use of assistive devices, self-catheterization, and administration of medications that affect the course of the disease or treat complications. An education plan that addresses intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of medications (including side effects) is developed for the patient and their family or caregiver. The patient and family are educated about exercises that enable the patient to continue some form of activity or that maintain or improve function (see <a href="#ct64-3">Chart&#x00A0;64-3</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> After discharge, the nurse often provides education and reinforcement of new interventions in the patient&#x2019;s home. Nurses in the home setting assess for changes in the patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional status; provide physical care to the patient if required; coordinate outpatient services and resources; and encourage health promotion, appropriate health screenings, and adaptation. Modifications that allow independence in the home should be implemented (e.g., assistive eating devices, raised toilet seat, bathing aids, telephone modifications, long-handled comb, tongs, modified clothing).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If changes in the disease or its course are noted, the nurse encourages the patient to contact the primary provider, because treatment of an acute exacerbation or new problem may be indicated. Continuing health care and follow-up are recommended.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with MS is encouraged to contact the local chapter of the National MS Society for services, publications, and contact with others who have MS (see the Resources section). Local chapters also provide direct services to patients. Through group interaction, the patient has an opportunity to meet others with similar problems, share experiences, and learn self-help methods.</p>
