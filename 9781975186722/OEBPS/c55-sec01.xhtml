<h4 class="h4" id="s2570">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The skin is the largest organ system of the body and is essential for human life. It participates in many vital body functions; it forms a barrier between the internal and external environment protecting the body from pathogens, helps regulate temperature and water loss, and provides sensory input.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2571">Anatomy of the Skin, Hair, Nails, and Glands of the Skin</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Skin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The skin is composed of three layers: epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue (<a href="#ff55-1">Fig.&#x00A0;55-1</a>). The epidermis is an outermost layer of stratified epithelial cells, composed predominantly of keratinocytes. It ranges in thickness from about 0.05 mm on the eyelids to about 1.5 mm on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Four distinct layers compose the epidermis; from innermost to outermost, they are the stratum germinativum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum. Each layer becomes more differentiated (i.e., mature and with more specific functions) as it rises from the basal stratum germinativum layer to the outermost stratum corneum layer.</p>
<p class="h7">Epidermis</p>
<p class="nonindent">The epidermis, which is contiguous with the mucous membranes and the lining of the ear canals, consists of live, continuously dividing cells called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;keratinocytes:&lt;/b&gt; arising from the innermost layer of the epidermis, synthesize the insoluble protein, keratin">keratinocytes</button></strong>, which differentiate and randomly migrate upward. These cells synthesize keratin; eventually they become metabolically inactive and form a thick and protective outer layer. This external layer, called the stratum corneum, is almost completely replaced every 3 to 4 weeks. The dead cells contain large amounts of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;keratin:&lt;/b&gt; an insoluble, fibrous protein that forms the outer skin layer">keratin</button></strong>, an insoluble, fibrous protein that forms the outer barrier of the skin and has the capacity to repel pathogens and prevent excessive fluid loss from the body. Keratin is the principal hardening ingredient of the hair and nails.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;melanocytes:&lt;/b&gt; cells of the skin that produce melanin">Melanocytes</button></strong> are the special cells of the epidermis that are primarily involved in producing the pigment <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;melanin:&lt;/b&gt; the substance responsible for coloration of the skin">melanin</button></strong>, which colors the skin and hair. A person&#x2019;s normal skin color is determined by the amount of melanin produced. Most of the skin of people who are dark skinned and the darker areas of the skin on people who are light skinned (e.g., the nipple) contain larger amounts of melanin and are not related to numbers of melanocytes. Normal skin color depends on race and varies from pale, almost ivory, to deep brown, almost pure black. Systemic disease can affect skin color. For example, insufficient oxygenation of the blood will induce cyanosis (a bluish hue in the skin of individuals who are light skinned), significant liver disease manifests as jaundice or icterus (a yellow green skin tone), and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythema:&lt;/b&gt; diffuse redness of the skin">erythema</button></strong> (a pink or red skin shade caused by dilation of the capillaries) is seen when there is inflammation or fever.</p>
<p class="indent">Production of melanin is influenced by several factors including a hormone secreted from the hypothalamus of the brain called <em>melanocyte-stimulating hormone.</em> It is believed that melanin production responds in a protective manner with increased ultraviolet light in sunlight.</p>
<p class="indent">Two other types of cells are common to the epidermis: Merkel and Langerhans cells. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Merkel cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells of the epidermis that play a role in transmission of sensory messages">Merkel cells</button></strong> are not fully understood but may have a role as receptors that transmit stimuli to the axon (long projection of a nerve cell) through a chemical synapse. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Langerhans cells:&lt;/b&gt; dendritic clear cells in the epidermis that carry surface receptors for immunoglobulin and complement and that are active participants in delayed hypersensitivity of the skin">Langerhans cells</button></strong> are believed to play a significant role in cutaneous immune system reactions. These accessory cells of the afferent immune system process invading antigens and transport the antigens to the lymph system to activate the T lymphocytes.</p>
<p class="indent">The characteristics of the epidermis vary in different areas of the body. It is thickest over the palms of the hands and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1800" title="1800"></span>soles of the feet and contains increased amounts of keratin. The thickness of the epidermis can increase with friction and pressure and can result in calluses forming on the hands or corns forming on the feet.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff55-1">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff55-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff55-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;55-1 &#x2022;</span> Anatomic structures of the skin.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The junction of the epidermis and dermis is an area of undulations and furrows called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rete ridges:&lt;/b&gt; undulations and furrows that appear at the lower edge of the epidermis at the dermal junction where these two skin layers are cemented together">rete ridges</button></strong> on the epidermal side and dermal papillae on the dermal side. Anchors found in this junction hold together the epidermis and dermis, permitting the free exchange of essential nutrients between the two layers. This interlocking between the dermis and epidermis produces ripples on the surface of the skin. On the fingertips, these ripples are called <em>fingerprints.</em> They are a person&#x2019;s most individual physical characteristic, and they rarely change over time (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Wilhelmi &#x0026; Molnar, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Dermis</p>
<p class="nonindent">The dermis makes up the largest portion of the skin, the connective tissue between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue. It provides strength and structure in the form of collagen and elastic fibers. It is composed of two layers: papillary and reticular. Collagen fibers are loosely organized in the papillary dermis and are more tightly packed in the reticular dermis. The dermis also contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves, sweat and sebaceous glands, and hair roots.</p>
<p class="h7">Subcutaneous Tissue</p>
<p class="nonindent">The subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, is the innermost layer of the skin. It is primarily adipose and connective tissue, which provides a cushion between the skin layers and the muscles and bones. This layer also protects the nerve and vascular structures that transect the layers. It promotes skin mobility, molds body contours, and insulates the body. The subcutaneous tissues and the amount of fat deposited are important factors in body temperature regulation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hair</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An outgrowth of the skin, hair is present over the entire body except for the palms and soles. The hair consists of a root formed in the dermis and a hair shaft that projects beyond the skin. It grows in a cavity called a <em>hair follicle.</em> Proliferation of cells in the bulb portion of the follicle causes the hair to form (see <a href="#ff55-1">Fig.&#x00A0;55-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout a person&#x2019;s life, hair follicles undergo continuous cycles of growth, transition, and rest. The rate of growth varies; beard growth is the most rapid, followed by hair on the scalp, axillae, thighs, and eyebrows. The growth (anagen) phase may last 2 to 6 years for scalp hair, the involution (catagen) phase lasts 2 to 3 weeks, followed by the telogen or resting phase, which lasts 2 to 3 months. During telogen, hair is shed from the body. The hair follicle independently recycles into the growing phase spontaneously (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Nicol, 2016</a>). Growing and resting hairs can be found side by side on all parts of the body. About 90% to 95% of the hair follicles on a normal scalp are in the growing (anagen) phase, around 1% are involuting (catagen), and 5% to 10% are in the shedding (telogen) phase at any one time. A person will typically shed approximately 100 scalp hairs each day (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3975">Habif, Dinulos, Chapman, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There is a small bulge on the side of the hair follicle that houses the stem cells that migrate down to the follicle root and begin the hair shaft reproduction cycle. These bulges also contain the stem cells that migrate upward to reproduce skin. The location of these cells on the side of the hair shaft, rather than at the base, is a factor in hair loss. In conditions in which inflammation causes damage to the root of the hair, regrowth is possible. However, if inflammation causes damage to the side of the hair follicle, stem cells are destroyed, and the hair will not grow.</p>
<p class="indent">In certain locations on the body, hair growth is controlled by sex hormones. The most obvious example is the growth of hair on the face (i.e., beard, mustache), chest, and back, which is controlled by the male hormones known as androgens. Both men and women produce and need androgens, but in differing amounts. Women with higher levels of the androgen testosterone have hair in the areas generally thought of as masculine, such as the face, chest, and lower abdomen. This is often a normal genetic variation, but if it appears along with irregular menses and weight changes, it may indicate a hormonal imbalance (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Habif et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hair in different parts of the body serves different functions. The hairs of the eyes (i.e., eyebrows, lashes), nose, and ears filter out dust, bugs, and airborne debris. The hair of the skin provides thermal insulation in mammals with hair or fur. This function is enhanced during cold or fright by piloerection (i.e., hairs standing on end), caused by contraction of the tiny erector muscles attached to the hair follicle. The piloerector response that occurs in humans is probably vestigial (i.e., rudimentary), no longer serving its original purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Hair color is supplied by varying amounts of melanin within the hair shaft. Gray or white hair reflects the loss of pigment. Hair quantity and distribution can be affected by endocrine conditions. For example, Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome causes <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hirsutism:&lt;/b&gt; the condition of having excessive hair growth">hirsutism</button></strong> (i.e., excessive hair growth), especially in women, and hypothyroidism (i.e., underactive thyroid) causes changes in hair texture. Various factors can cause localized or generalized loss of hair, or <strong>alopecia.</strong> Chemotherapy and radiation therapy cause reversible hair thinning or weakening of the hair shaft. Several autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and alopecia areata, cause hair loss in smaller defined areas. Folliculitis of the scalp will cause inflammation of the hair roots and may result in scarring hair loss.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nails</h6>
<p class="nonindent">On the dorsal surface of the fingers and toes, a hard, transparent plate of keratin, called the <em>nail,</em> overlies the skin. The nail grows from its root, which lies under a thin fold of skin called the <em>cuticle.</em> Nail functions include scratching and protecting the highly developed sensory functions of fingers and toes to assist in grasping small items. The nails can also be of psychosocial importance as related to grooming and appearance (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Nicol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nail growth is continuous throughout life, with an average growth of 0.1 mm daily. Growth is faster in fingernails than toenails and tends to slow with aging. Complete regeneration of a fingernail takes about 6 months, whereas toenail regeneration takes approximately 18 months (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia, Schaffer, &#x0026; Cerroni, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Glands of the Skin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are two types of skin glands: <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sebaceous glands:&lt;/b&gt; glands that exist within the epidermis and secrete sebum to keep the skin soft and pliable">sebaceous glands</button></strong> and sweat glands (see <a href="#ff55-1">Fig.&#x00A0;55-1</a>). The sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. The ducts of the sebaceous glands empty <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sebum:&lt;/b&gt; fatty secretion of the sebaceous glands">sebum</button></strong> (fatty secretions) onto the space between the hair follicle and the hair shaft, thus lubricating the hair and rendering the skin soft and pliable.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1800</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1801" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1801">p. 1801</span></div>
<p class="indent">Sweat glands are found in the skin over most of the body surface, but they are most heavily concentrated in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Only the glans penis, clitoris, labia minora, the margins of the lips, the external ear, and the nail bed are devoid of sweat glands. Sweat glands are subclassified into two categories: eccrine and apocrine.</p>
<p class="indent">The eccrine sweat glands are found in all areas of the skin. Their ducts open directly onto the skin surface. The thin, watery secretion called <em>sweat</em> is produced in the basal coiled portion of the eccrine gland and is released into its narrow duct. Sweat is composed predominantly of water and contains about half of the salt content of blood plasma. Sweat is released from eccrine glands in response to elevated ambient temperature and elevated body temperature. The rate of sweat secretion is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. Excessive sweating of the palms and soles, axillae, forehead, and other areas may occur in response to pain and stress.</p>
<p class="indent">The apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and are located in the axillae, periumbilical area, nipple, anal region, scrotum, and labia majora. Their ducts generally open onto hair follicles. The apocrine glands become active at puberty. In women, they enlarge and recede with each menstrual cycle. Apocrine glands produce an oily sweat that is sometimes broken down by bacteria, such as <em>Corynebacterium</em> species, to produce the characteristic underarm odor. Specialized apocrine glands called <em>ceruminous glands</em> are found in the external ear, where they produce cerumen (i.e., wax).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2572">Functions of the Skin</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Protection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The skin covering most of the body is no more than 1 mm thick, but intact skin provides highly effective protection against invasion by bacteria and other foreign matter. The thickened skin of the palms and soles protects against the effects of the constant trauma that occurs in these areas.</p>
<p class="indent">The stratum corneum&#x2014;the outer layer of the epidermis&#x2014;provides the most effective barrier to epidermal water loss and penetration of environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation, chemicals, microbes, and insect bites.</p>
<p class="indent">Various lipids are synthesized in the stratum corneum and are the basis for the barrier function of this layer. These are long-chain lipids that are suited for water-resistant ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia et al., 2017</a>). The presence of these lipids in the stratum corneum creates a relatively impermeable barrier for water loss and for the entry of toxins, microbes, and other substances that contact the surface of the skin.</p>
<p class="indent">Some substances do penetrate the skin but meet resistance in trying to move through the channels between the cell layers of the stratum corneum. Microbes and fungi, which are part of the body&#x2019;s normal flora, cannot penetrate unless there is a break in the skin barrier.</p>
<p class="indent">The basal layer, at the junction of the epidermis and dermis, is composed of collagen, anchoring fibers, and macromolecules. The basal layer serves four functions. It acts as a support structure for tissue organization and a template for regeneration; it provides selective permeability for migration of cells and proteins; it is a physical barrier between different types of cells; and it binds the epithelium to underlying cell layers (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sensation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The receptor endings of nerves in the skin allow the body to constantly monitor the conditions of the immediate environment. The main functions of the receptors in the skin are to sense temperature, pain, light touch, and pressure (or heavy touch). Different nerve endings respond to each of the different stimuli. Although the nerve endings are distributed over the entire body, they are more concentrated in the head and distal extremities.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluid Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The stratum corneum&#x2014;the outermost layer of the epidermis&#x2014;has the capacity to absorb water, thereby preventing an excessive loss of water and electrolytes from the internal body and retaining moisture in the subcutaneous tissues. When skin is damaged, as occurs with a severe burn, large quantities of fluids and electrolytes may be lost rapidly, possibly leading to circulatory collapse, shock, and death (see <a href="c57.xhtml">Chapter 57</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The skin is not completely impermeable to water. Small amounts of water continuously evaporate from the skin surface. This evaporation, called <em>insensible perspiration,</em> amounts to approximately 500 mL daily in an average-sized adult (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Norris, 2019</a>). Insensible water loss varies with temperature, both body and ambient. In a person with a fever, the loss can increase in a predictable fashion, approximately 12% for every 1&#x00B0;C (1.8&#x00B0;F) increase in body temperature (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Temperature Regulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The body, in the process of creating energy, continuously produces heat as a result of the metabolism of food. This heat is dissipated primarily through the skin. Three major physical processes are involved in loss of heat from the body to the environment. The first process&#x2014;radiation&#x2014;is the transfer of heat to another object of lower temperature situated at a distance. The second process&#x2014;conduction&#x2014;is the transfer of heat from the body to a cooler object in contact with it. The third process&#x2014;convection, which consists of movement of warm air molecules away from the body&#x2014;is the transfer of heat by conduction to the air surrounding the body.</p>
<p class="indent">Evaporation from the skin aids heat loss by conduction. Heat is conducted through the skin into water molecules on its surface, causing the water to evaporate. The water on the skin surface may be from insensible perspiration, sweat, or the environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Normally, all these heat loss mechanisms are used. When the ambient temperature is extremely high, evaporation becomes the only effective means to disperse generated body heat.</p>
<p class="indent">Under normal conditions, metabolic heat production is balanced by heat loss, and the internal temperature of the body is maintained constant at approximately 37&#x00B0;C (98.6&#x00B0;F). The rate of heat loss depends primarily on the surface temperature of the skin, which is a function of the skin blood flow. Under normal conditions, the total blood circulated through the skin is approximately 450 mL/min, or 10 to 20&#x00A0;times the amount of blood required to provide necessary metabolites and oxygen. Blood flow through these skin vessels is controlled primarily by the sympathetic nervous system. Increased blood flow to the skin results in more heat delivered to the skin and a greater rate of heat loss from the body. In contrast, decreased skin blood flow reduces the skin temperature and helps conserve heat for the body. When the temperature of the body begins to fall, as occurs on a cold day, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1802" title="1802"></span>the blood vessels of the skin constrict, thereby reducing heat loss from the body (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sweating is another process by which the body can regulate the rate of heat loss. Sweating does not occur until the core body temperature exceeds 37&#x00B0;C (98.6&#x00B0;F), regardless of skin temperature. In extremely hot environments, the rate of sweat production may be as high as 1 L/h. Under some circumstances (e.g., emotional stress), sweating may occur as a reflex and may be unrelated to the need to lose heat from the body (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vitamin Production</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Skin exposed to ultraviolet light can synthesize vitamin D (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D is essential for preventing osteoporosis and rickets, a condition that causes bone deformities and results from a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. Estimations vary on the amount of sunlight necessary for this synthesis to occur since numerous individual and environmental variables make a uniform recommendation difficult. In some projections, most people would need 5 to 30 minutes of sun exposure twice a week. No studies to date have determined if vitamin D synthesis in the skin can occur without increasing skin cancer risk (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3982">Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, 2019</a>). Adequate amounts of Vitamin D should be obtained from a healthy diet and supplementation rather than intentional sun exposure (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Immune Response Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The skin functions not only as a barrier defense against environmental hazards, but also produces immune responses. The skin has the capacity to generate innate and adaptive immune responses (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia et al., 2017</a>). Innate immune functions of the skin include the closely packed layers of the stratum corneum, the nonspecific inflammatory response of pattern recognition receptors, and a chemical environment that inhibits microbial colonization (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Norris, 2019</a>). The Langerhans cells of the skin are part of adaptive immunity. They function as antigen-presenting cells, with the ability to transport foreign substances to nearby lymph nodes for cell-mediated immune reaction (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2573"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The skin undergoes many physiologic changes associated with normal aging that affect functioning; these changes include decreased dermal thickness, degeneration of collagen, decreased sebum production, and increased vascular fragility (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Norris, 2019</a>). Other factors such as lifetime of excessive sun exposure, systemic diseases, and poor nutrition can increase the range of skin conditions and the rapidity with which they appear. In addition, certain medications (e.g., antihistamine, antibiotic, and diuretic agents) are photosensitizing and increase the damage that results from sun exposure.</p>
<p class="indent">The visible changes in the skin of older adults include dryness, wrinkling, uneven pigmentation, and various proliferative lesions. Cellular changes associated with aging include a thinning at the junction of the dermis and epidermis. The result of this thinning is fewer anchoring sites between the two skin layers, which means that even minor injury or stress to the epidermis can cause it to shear away from the dermis. This phenomenon may account for the increased vulnerability of aged skin to trauma. With increasing age, the epidermis and dermis thin and flatten, causing wrinkles, sags, and overlapping skin folds (<a href="#ff55-2">Fig.&#x00A0;55-2</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff55-2">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff55-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff55-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;55-2 &#x2022;</span> Hands with skin atrophy common to aging skin.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Loss of the subcutaneous tissue substances of elastin, collagen, and fat diminishes the protection and cushioning of underlying tissues and organs, decreases muscle tone, and results in the loss of the insulating properties of fat.</p>
<p class="indent">Cellular replacement slows as a result of aging. As the dermal layers thin, the skin becomes fragile and transparent. The blood supply to the skin also changes with age. Vessels, especially the capillary loops, decrease in number and size. These vascular changes contribute to the delayed wound healing commonly seen in the older adult patient. The dry scaly skin common in aging is likely the consequence of decreased water retention by an impaired stratum corneum and the decreased number and functional ability of sweat and sebaceous glands (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bolognia et al., 2017</a>). Reduced androgen levels are thought to contribute to declining sebaceous gland function.</p>
<p class="indent">Hair growth gradually diminishes, especially over the lower legs and dorsum of the feet. Thinning is common in the scalp, axillae, and pubic areas. Other functions affected by normal aging include the barrier function of skin, sensory perception, and thermoregulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Damage from excessive sun exposure, called photoaging, has detrimental effects on the normal aging of skin. A lifetime of outdoor work or outdoor activities (e.g., construction work, lifeguarding, sunbathing) without prudent use of covering clothing and sunscreens can lead to profound wrinkling, increased loss of elasticity, mottled, pigmented areas, cutaneous atrophy, and benign or malignant lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">Many skin lesions are part of normal aging. Recognizing and differentiating these lesions enables the examiner to assist the patient to feel less anxious about changes in skin. <a href="c55-sec02.xhtml#ct55-1">Chart&#x00A0;55-1</a> summarizes some skin lesions that are expected to appear as the skin ages. These are normal and require no special attention unless the skin becomes infected or irritated.</p>
