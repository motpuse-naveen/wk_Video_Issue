<h4 class="h4" id="s790">Assessment of the Cardiovascular&#x00A0;System</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The frequency and extent of the nursing assessment of cardiovascular function are based on several factors, including the severity of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms, the presence of risk factors, the practice setting, and the purpose of the assessment. Although the key components of the cardiovascular assessment remain the same, the assessment priorities vary according to patient needs. For example, an emergency department (ED) nurse performs a rapid and focused assessment of a patient in which <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;acute coronary syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; a constellation of signs and symptoms due to the rupture of atherosclerotic plaque and resultant partial or complete thrombosis within a diseased coronary artery">acute coronary syndrome</button></strong> (ACS), signs and symptoms caused by ruptured atheromatous plaque in a diseased coronary artery, is suspected. Diagnosis and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page657" title="657"></span>treatment must be started immediately, which includes an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 minutes of arrival to the ED (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1681">Yiadom, Baugh, McWade, et al., 2017</a>). The physical assessment is ongoing and concentrates on evaluating the patient for ACS complications, such as a myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmias, and HF, and determining the effectiveness of medical treatment.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s791">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient&#x2019;s ability to recognize cardiac symptoms and to know what to do when they occur is essential for effective self-care management. All too often, a patient&#x2019;s new symptoms or those of progressing cardiac dysfunction go unrecognized, resulting in lifesaving treatment delays. Research findings suggest that ethnic and socioeconomic factors can lead to patient-related delays (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1655">Iacoe, Ratner, Wong, et al., 2018</a>). Women, African Americans, and older patients are reported to delay seeking treatment when they have had MIs (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Zipes et al., 2019</a>). Socioeconomic factors such as poverty, high health care costs, lack of insurance, transportation, and proximity to a health care provider or hospital can also lead to delays in care. Patients may also lack knowledge about ACS symptoms, or experience denial, fear, or uncertainty about what to do when having chest pain. Some women have the misperception that the risk for cardiac disease is only linked to weight. A female patient who is embarrassed from the social stigma of being overweight may not see a health care provider, or could be reluctant to disclose important cardiac symptoms (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1670">Merz, Andersen, Sprague, et al., 2017</a>). Therefore, during the health history, the nurse determines if the patient and involved family members are able to recognize symptoms of an acute cardiac problem, such as ACS or HF, and seek timely treatment of these symptoms. Responses to this level of inquiry will help the nurse individualize the plan for patient and family education.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The signs and symptoms experienced by people with CVD are related to arrhythmias and conduction problems (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>); CAD (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>); structural, infectious, and inflammatory disorders of the heart (see <a href="c24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>); and complications of CAD such as HF and cardiogenic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;11</a> and <a href="c25.xhtml">25</a>). These disorders have many signs and symptoms in common; therefore, the nurse must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page658" title="658"></span>be skillful at recognizing these signs and symptoms so that patients are given timely and often lifesaving care.</p>
<p class="indent">The following are the most common signs and symptoms of CVD, with related medical diagnoses in parentheses:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Chest pain or discomfort (angina pectoris, ACS, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease)</span></li>
<li><span>Pain or discomfort in other areas of upper body, including one or both arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach (ACS)</span></li>
<li><span>Shortness of breath or dyspnea (ACS, cardiogenic shock, HF, valvular heart disease)</span></li>
<li><span>Peripheral edema, weight gain, abdominal distention due to enlarged spleen and liver or ascites (HF)</span></li>
<li><span>Palpitations (tachycardia from a variety of causes, including ACS, caffeine or other stimulants, electrolyte imbalances, stress, valvular heart disease, ventricular aneurysms)</span></li>
<li><span>Unusual fatigue, sometimes referred to as vital exhaustion (an early warning symptom of ACS, HF, or valvular heart disease, characterized by feeling unusually tired or fatigued, irritable, and dejected)</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Dizziness, syncope, or changes in level of consciousness (cardiogenic shock, cerebrovascular disorders, arrhythmias, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal episode)</p>
<p class="indent">Symptoms of ACS can differ between men and women. Chest pain and discomfort related to ACS can occur in both men and women. However, women may experience more atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as chest pain at rest; pain in the jaw, arm, neck, shoulder, middle back, or epigastrium; nausea; vomiting; syncope; sweating; anxiety; and fatigue (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1665">Lichtman, Leifheit, Safdar, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Merz et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Chest Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Chest pain and chest discomfort are common symptoms that may be caused by a number of cardiac and noncardiac problems. <a href="#tt21-2">Table&#x00A0;21-2</a> summarizes the characteristics and patterns of common causes of chest pain or discomfort. To differentiate among these causes of pain, the nurse asks the patient to identify the quantity (0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain), location, and quality of pain. The nurse assesses for radiation of the pain to other areas of the body and determines if associated signs and symptoms are present, such as diaphoresis or nausea. It is important to identify the events that precipitate the onset of symptoms, the duration of the symptoms, and measures that aggravate or relieve the symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse keeps the following important points in mind when assessing patients reporting chest pain or discomfort:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The location of chest symptoms is not well correlated with the cause of the pain. For example, substernal chest pain can result from a number of causes as outlined in <a href="#tt21-2">Table&#x00A0;21-2</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>The severity or duration of chest pain or discomfort does not predict the seriousness of its cause. For example, when asked to rate pain using a 0 to 10 scale, patients experiencing esophageal spasm may rate their chest pain as a 10. In contrast, patients having an acute MI, which is a potentially life-threatening event, may report having moderate pain rated as a 4 to 6 on the pain scale.</span></li>
<li><span>More than one clinical cardiac condition may occur simultaneously. During an MI, patients may report chest pain from myocardial ischemia, shortness of breath from HF, and palpitations from arrhythmias. Both HF and arrhythmias can be complications of an acute MI. (See <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for discussion of clinical manifestations of ACS, including MI.)</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health, Family, and Social History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The health history provides an opportunity for the nurse to assess patients&#x2019; understanding of their personal risk factors for peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, and CAD and any measures that they are taking to modify these risks. Some risk factors, such as increasing age, male gender, and heredity, including race are not modifiable. However, there are a number of risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity that can be modified by lifestyle changes or medications (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1649">Arnett, Blumenthal, Albert, et al., 2019</a>). Online tools from the AHA and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) can be used to screen a person&#x2019;s risk for CVD, including risk for having an MI or stroke (ACC, 2019; AHA, 2018; see Resources at the end of this chapter for a link to these tools).</p>
<p class="indent">In an effort to determine how patients perceive their current health status, the nurse asks the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>How is your health? Have you noticed any changes from last year? From 5 years ago?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you have a cardiologist or primary provider? How often do you go for checkups?</span></li>
<li><span>What health concerns do you have?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you have a family history of genetic disorders that place you at risk for CVD (<a href="#ct21-1">Chart&#x00A0;21-1</a>)?</span></li>
<li><span>What are your risk factors for CAD (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, <a href="c23-sec02.xhtml#ct23-1">Chart&#x00A0;23-1</a>)?</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>What do you do to stay healthy and take care of your heart?</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who do not understand the connection between risk factors and CAD may be unwilling to make recommended lifestyle changes or manage their illness effectively. In contrast, patients who have this understanding may be more motivated to alter their lifestyle to avoid the risk of future cardiac events. The AHA published lifestyle management guidelines that identify interventions and treatment goals for each of these risk factors (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Arnett et al., 2019</a>). <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> provides an overview of this information.</p>
<p class="h7">Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses collaborate with other health care providers, including pharmacists, to obtain a complete list of the patient&#x2019;s medications, including dose and frequency. Vitamins, herbals, and other over-the-counter medications are included on this list. During this aspect of the health assessment, the nurse asks the following questions to ensure that the patient is safely and effectively taking the prescribed medications.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>What are the names and doses of your medications?</span></li>
<li><span>What is the purpose of each of these medications?</span></li>
<li><span>How and when are these medications taken? Do you ever skip a dose or forget to take them?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any special precautions associated with any of these medications?</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>What symptoms or problems do you need to report to your primary provider?</p>

<p class="indent">Patients recovering from ACS, including coronary stent placement or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), are commonly prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). DAPT means that two antiplatelet drugs are prescribed for the patient. Aspirin, an OTC antiplatelet medication, is often prescribed for life. In addition, a second antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor medication (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) is prescribed for 1 to 12 months, depending upon a variety of factors, including the patient&#x2019;s diagnosis and the type of procedure done (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for further discussion of ACS treatment and pharmacologic management) (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1664">Levine, Bates, Bittl, et al., 2016</a>). During a careful medication history, the nurse reinforces the necessity for adherence to the medication regimen.</p>
<p class="h7">Nutrition</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dietary modifications, exercise, weight loss, and careful monitoring are important strategies for managing three major cardiovascular risk factors: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Diets that are restricted in sodium, fat, cholesterol, or calories are commonly prescribed. The nurse obtains the following information:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The patient&#x2019;s current height and weight (to determine body mass index [BMI]); waist measurement; BP; and any laboratory test results such as blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (diabetes), total blood cholesterol, HDL and LDL levels, and triglyceride levels (hyperlipidemia)</span></li>
<li><span>How often the patient self-monitors BP, blood glucose, and weight as appropriate to the medical diagnoses</span></li>
<li><span>The patient&#x2019;s level of awareness regarding their target goals for each of the risk factors and any problems achieving or maintaining these goals</span></li>
<li><span>What the patient normally eats and drinks in a typical day and any food preferences (including cultural or ethnic preferences)</span></li>
<li><span>Eating habits (canned or commercially prepared foods vs. fresh foods, restaurant meals vs. home cooking, assessing for high-sodium foods, dietary intake of fats)</span></li></ul>

</div>
<p class="h7">Elimination</p>
<p class="nonindent">Typical bowel and bladder habits need to be identified. Nocturia (awakening at night to urinate) is common in patients with HF. Fluid collected in gravity-dependent tissues (extremities) during the day (i.e., edema) redistributes into the circulatory system once the patient is recumbent at night. The increased circulatory volume is excreted by the kidneys (increased urine production).</p>
<p class="indent">When straining during defecation, the patient bears down (the Valsalva maneuver), which momentarily increases pressure on the baroreceptors. This triggers a vagal response, causing the heart rate to slow and resulting in syncope in some patients. Straining during urination can produce the same response.</p>
<p class="indent">Because many cardiac medications can cause gastrointestinal side effects or bleeding, the nurse asks about bloating, diarrhea, constipation, stomach upset, heartburn, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Screening for bloody urine or stools should be done for patients taking antiplatelet medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), platelet aggregation inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban), or anticoagulants (low-molecular-weight heparins such as dalteparin or enoxaparin; heparin; or oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, rivaroxaban, or apixaban).</p>
<p class="h7">Activity and Exercise</p>
<p class="nonindent">Changes in the patient&#x2019;s activity tolerance are often gradual and may go unnoticed. The nurse determines if there are recent changes by comparing the patient&#x2019;s current activity level with that performed in the past 6 to 12 months. New symptoms or a change in the usual symptoms during activity is a significant finding. Activity-induced angina or shortness of breath may indicate CAD. These CAD-related symptoms occur when myocardial ischemia is present, due to an inadequate arterial blood supply to the myocardium, in the setting of increased demand (e.g., exercise, stress, or anemia). Patients experiencing these kinds of symptoms need to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page662" title="662"></span>seek medical attention. Fatigue, associated with a low left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 40%) and certain medications (e.g., beta-adrenergic&#x2013;blocking agents), can result in activity intolerance. Patients with fatigue may benefit from having their medications adjusted and learning energy conservation techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">Additional areas to explore include the presence of architectural barriers in the home (stairs, multilevel home); the patient&#x2019;s participation in cardiac rehabilitation; and his or her current exercise pattern including intensity, duration, and frequency.</p>
<p class="h7">Sleep and Rest</p>
<p class="nonindent">Clues to worsening cardiac disease, especially HF, can be revealed by sleep-related events. Patients with worsening HF often experience <em>orthopnea,</em> a term used to indicate the need to sit upright or stand to avoid feeling short of breath. Patients experiencing orthopnea will report that they need to sleep upright in a chair or add extra pillows to their bed. Sudden awakening with shortness of breath, called <em>paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,</em> is an additional symptom of worsening HF. This nighttime symptom is caused by the reabsorption of fluid from dependent areas of the body (arms and legs) back into the circulatory system within hours of lying in bed. This sudden fluid shift increases preload and places increased demand on the heart of patients with HF, causing sudden pulmonary congestion.</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is an abnormal respiratory pattern due to intermittent episodes of upper airway obstruction causing apnea and hypopnea (shallow respirations) during sleep. These abnormal sleep events cause intermittent hypoxemia, sympathetic nervous system activation, and increased intrathoracic pressure that puts mechanical stress on the heart and large artery walls. SDB impacts the length and quality of sleep. Short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) and poor sleep quality (interrupted sleep) are associated with the cardiovascular risks of hypertension, atherosclerosis, CAD, and stroke (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1651">Dom&#x00ED;nguez, Fuster, Fern&#x00E1;ndez-Alvira, et al., 2019</a>). Untreated SDB is also linked to HF and arrhythmias. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a type of SDB that is treated by the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), although many patients have difficulty with CPAP adherance. Other treatment options include weight loss, positional therapy, mandibular advancement devices (MADs), oral appliances, or surgery (Won, Mohsenin, &#x0026; Kryger, 2018; see <a href="c18.xhtml">Chapter 18</a> for further discussion of OSA, including risks).</p>
<p class="indent">During the health history, the nurse assesses for SDB by asking patients at risk if they snore loudly, have frequent bouts of awaking from sleep, awaken with a headache, or experience hypersomnolence (severe daytime sleepiness). For patients with a diagnosis of SDB or OSA, the nurse determines if the patient has been prescribed a CPAP, MAD, or oral appliance, and the frequency of its use. Patients who are being admitted to the hospital or going for an ambulatory surgical procedure should be instructed to bring their sleep aid devices with them.</p>
<p class="h7">Self-Perception and Self-Concept</p>
<p class="nonindent">Self-perception and self-concept are both related to the cognitive and emotional processes that people use to formulate their beliefs and feelings about themselves. Having a chronic cardiac illness, such as HF, or experiencing an acute cardiac event, such as an MI, can alter a person&#x2019;s self-perception and self-concept. Patients&#x2019; beliefs and feelings about their health are key determinants of adherence to self-care recommendations and recovery after an acute cardiac event. To reduce the risk of future cardiovascular-related health problems, patients are asked to make difficult lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking. Patients who have misperceptions about the health consequences of their illness are at risk for nonadherence to these recommended lifestyle changes. The health history is used to discover how patients perceive their health by asking questions that may include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>What is your cardiac condition?</span></li>
<li><span>How has this illness changed your feelings about your health?</span></li>
<li><span>What do you think caused this illness?</span></li>
<li><span>What consequences do you think this illness will have on your physical activity, work, social relationships, and role in your family?</span></li>
<li><span>How much of an influence do you think you have on controlling this illness?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s responses to these questions can guide the nurse in planning interventions to ensure that the patient is prepared to manage the illness and that adequate services are in place to support the patient&#x2019;s recovery and self-care needs.</p>
<p class="h7">Roles and Relationships</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with CVD are being managed with complex medical regimens and sophisticated technology, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and left ventricular assist devices. Hospital stays for cardiac disorders have shortened. Many invasive diagnostic cardiac procedures, such as cardiac catheterization, are being performed in the ambulatory setting. Support from family members helps to lessen the patient&#x2019;s burden of managing self-care for cardiac illnesses. Social support is closely linked to patient depression and CVD outcomes. Patients who are depressed and who have poor social support have an increased risk of poor cardiac outcomes (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1660">Kim, Kang, Bae, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To assess patients&#x2019; roles in their families and their relationships, both components of social support, the nurse asks each patient: Who do you live with? Who is your primary caregiver at home? Who helps you manage your health? The nurse also assesses for any significant effects that the cardiac illness has had on the patient&#x2019;s role in the family. Are there adequate finances and health insurance? The answers to these questions help the nurse determine if consultation with social services or others is necessary to tailor the plan of care to meet the patient&#x2019;s self-care needs.</p>
<p class="h7">Sexuality and Reproduction</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sexual dysfunction affects twice as many people with CVD compared with the general population. Depression, anxiety, erectile dysfunction, and major cardiac events such as an MI are common reasons that patients report decreased sexual activity. Patients and their partners are concerned about the effects of physical exertion on the heart and if the activity may cause another heart attack, sudden death, or untoward symptoms such as angina, dyspnea, or palpitations. Couples <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page663" title="663"></span>often lack adequate information about the physical demands related to sexual activity, which is considered a low-intensity exercise. The nurse can help patients by initiating discussions about sexuality and encouraging them to discuss problems with their primary provider or cardiologist. The exercise and counseling provided in cardiac rehabilitation programs may also improve sexual activity (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1650">Boothby, Dada, Rabi, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Depression, Self-Efficacy, and Physical Activity among Patients with Coronary Artery Disease</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Siow, E., Leung, D. Y., Wong, E. M., et al. (2018). Do depressive symptoms moderate the effects of exercise self-efficacy on physical activity among patients with coronary heart disease? <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing</em>, <em>33</em>(4), e26&#x2013;e34.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Physical activity and exercise can reduce cardiac complications in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with higher levels of self-efficacy are more likely to start and maintain an exercise program. Patients with CAD are also at risk for developing depression, which can lead to isolation and low activity levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the symptoms of depression, exercise self-efficacy, and physical activity among patients with CAD. The nurse researchers also explored if depression could impact the relationship between exercise self-efficacy and physical activity in this population.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A cross-sectional, exploratory study was conducted with adult participants with CAD who were hospitalized in an emergency medicine or general medical unit. This study was performed at two hospitals in Hong Kong. The nurse researchers conducted a survey interview with 149 participants before discharge from the hospital. Participants completed a survey with questions about their socioeconomic status, current level of physical activity, self-efficacy about exercise, and symptoms of depression. Participants were then asked about their physical activity using the Godin&#x2013;Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire, about exercise self-efficacy using the Self-Efficacy for Exercise scale, and about depression using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression tool. Other information such as body mass index (BMI), medical diagnosis, and how many times participants were admitted to the hospital was obtained from the hospital records.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Most participants in this study were older adults with a mean age of 73 &#x00B1;13 years, were male, married, living with family, and had a lower socioeconomic status. Approximately 50% of this sample had a normal BMI, and over half did some level of exercise. Participants with greater exercise self-efficacy were more likely to engage in physical activity. However, this relationship was stronger among participants with symptoms of depression. Participants who were depressed reported lower levels of self-efficacy and engaging in less physical activity.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The results of this study demonstrate the importance of assessing self-efficacy, physical activity, and depression among patients with CAD. It is important to intervene and educate patients about lifestyle changes that improve exercise self-efficacy. Improving this level of confidence can help patients who are depressed start or increase their level of physical activity, which may improve cardiovascular health.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A reproductive history is necessary for women of childbearing age, particularly those with seriously compromised cardiac function. The reproductive history includes information about previous pregnancies, plans for future pregnancies, oral contraceptive use (especially in women older than 35 years who smoke), menopausal status, and the use of HT. Women who have a history of preeclampsia during pregnancy, preterm labor, or giving birth to an infant that was small for gestational age have a higher risk for developing CVD (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1663">Lane-Cordova, Khan, Grobman, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Coping and Stress Tolerance</p>
<p class="nonindent">Anxiety, depression, and stress are known to influence both the development of and recovery from CAD and HF. Depression is twice as prevalent in women compared to men and has a negative impact on quality of life and overall prognosis. Patients who are depressed are more likely to be readmitted to the hospital after having a heart attack. The risk of depression is lower if the patient has relationship and work stability, a higher educational level, a healthy lifestyle, and the absence of comorbidities such as diabetes. Although the association between depression and CAD is not completely understood, biologic factors (e.g., platelet abnormalities, inflammatory responses, insulin resistance), lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, exercise, smoking), and behavioral factors (e.g., substance abuse, unemployment, social isolation) contribute to this link. Patients who are depressed are less motivated to adhere to follow-up appointments, take prescribed medications, or make recommended lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, losing weight, exercising, or participating in cardiac rehabilitation (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1658">Jha, Qamar, Vaduganathan, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1679">Vaccarino, Badimon, Bremner, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1682">Yuan, Fang, Liu, et al., 2019</a>). See <a href="#ct21-2">Chart&#x00A0;21-2</a> for a Nursing Research Profile on depression, self-efficacy, and physical activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with CAD or HF should be assessed for depression. Patients who have depression exhibit common signs and symptoms, such as feelings of worthlessness or guilt, problems falling asleep or staying asleep, having little interest or pleasure in doing things that they usually enjoy, having difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and recent changes in appetite or weight. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) is a two-question self-reported patient assessment tool recommended by the AHA. The nurse asks the patient:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Do you have little interest or pleasure in doing things over the last 2 weeks?</em></span></li>
<li><span><em>Are you feeling down, depressed or hopeless over the last 2 weeks?</em></span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The nurse scores the patient&#x2019;s responses to each question by assigning 0 for &#x201C;not at all,&#x201D; 1 for &#x201C;several days,&#x201D; 2 for &#x201C;more than half the days,&#x201D; or 3 for &#x201C;nearly every day.&#x201D; The PHQ-2 score ranges from 0 to 6. Patients with a positive score greater than or equal to 3 complete a focused screening called the PHQ-9 and are referred to their primary providers for further evaluation (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Jha et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 663</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page664" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="664">p. 664</span></div>
<p class="indent">Stress initiates a variety of responses, including increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol, and has been strongly linked to cardiovascular events, such as an MI. Therefore, patients need to be assessed for sources of stress; the nurse asks about recent or ongoing stressors, previous coping styles and effectiveness, and the patient&#x2019;s perception of their current mood and coping ability. A widely used tool used to measure life stress is the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1654">Homes &#x0026; Rahe, 1967</a>). Examples of items on this scale include death of a spouse, divorce, and change in responsibilities at work. Each item is assigned a score of 11 to 100. Patients identify the items that happened to them in the previous year. Patients with a score less than 150 have a slight risk for future illness, whereas a score of 150 to 299 indicates a moderate risk. A score of 300 or higher indicates a high risk for future illness. Consultation with a psychiatric advanced practice nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker is indicated for patients who are anxious or depressed or for patients who are having difficulty coping with their cardiac illness.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Physical assessment is conducted to confirm information obtained from the health history, to establish the patient&#x2019;s current or baseline condition, and, in subsequent assessments, to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. Once the initial physical assessment is completed, the frequency of future assessments is determined by the purpose of the encounter and the patient&#x2019;s condition. For example, a focused cardiac assessment may be performed each time the patient is seen in the outpatient setting, whereas patients in the acute care setting may require a more extensive assessment at least every 8 hours. During the physical assessment, the nurse evaluates the cardiovascular system for any deviations from normal with regard to the following (examples of abnormalities are in parentheses):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The heart as a pump (reduced pulse pressure, displaced PMI from fifth intercostal space midclavicular line, gallop sounds, murmurs)</span></li>
<li><span>Atrial and ventricular filling volumes and pressures (elevated jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, ascites, crackles, postural changes in BP)</span></li>
<li><span>Cardiac output (reduced pulse pressure, hypotension, tachycardia, reduced urine output, lethargy, or disorientation)</span></li>
<li><span>Compensatory mechanisms (peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia)</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">General Appearance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">This part of the assessment evaluates the patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness (alert, lethargic, stuporous, comatose) and mental status (oriented to person, place, time; coherence). Changes in level of consciousness and mental status may be attributed to inadequate perfusion of the brain from a compromised cardiac output or thromboembolic event (stroke). Patients are observed for signs of distress, which include pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, or anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse notes the size of the patient (normal, overweight, underweight, or cachectic). The patient&#x2019;s height and weight are measured to calculate BMI, as well as the waist circumference (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). These measures are used to determine if obesity (BMI greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and abdominal fat (males: waist greater than 40 inches; females: waist greater than 35 inches) are placing the patient at risk for CAD.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessment of the Skin and Extremities</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Examination of the skin includes all body surfaces, starting with the head and finishing with the lower extremities. Skin color, temperature, and texture are assessed for acute and chronic problems with arterial or venous circulation. <a href="#tt21-3">Table&#x00A0;21-3</a> summarizes common skin and extremity assessment findings in patients with CVD. The most noteworthy changes include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Signs and symptoms of acute obstruction of arterial blood flow in the extremities, referred to as the six <em>P</em>s, are <em>p</em>ain, <em>p</em>allor, <em>p</em>ulselessness, <em>p</em>aresthesia, <em>p</em>oikilothermia (coldness), and <em>p</em>aralysis. During the first few hours after invasive cardiac procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], or cardiac electrophysiology testing), affected extremities should be assessed frequently for these acute vascular changes.</span></li>
<li><span>Major blood vessels of the arms and legs may be used for catheter insertion. During these procedures, systemic anticoagulation with heparin is necessary, and bruising or small hematomas may occur at the catheter access site. However, large hematomas are a serious complication that can compromise circulating blood volume and cardiac output. Patients who have undergone these procedures must have catheter access sites frequently observed until hemostasis is adequately achieved.</span></li>
<li><span>Edema of the feet, ankles, or legs is called <em>peripheral edema.</em> Edema can be observed in the sacral area of patients on bed rest. The nurse assesses the patient for edema by using the thumb to place firm pressure over the dorsum of each foot, behind each medial malleolus, over the shins or sacral area for 5 seconds. <em>Pitting edema</em> is the term used to describe an indentation in the skin created by this pressure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, Fig.&#x00A0;25-2). The degree of pitting edema relies on the clinician&#x2019;s judgment of depth of edema and time the indentation remains after release of pressure. Pitting edema is graded as absent (0) or as present on a scale from trace (1+ &#x2264;0.25 inch) to severe (4+ &#x2265;1 inch) (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Urden, Stacy, &#x0026; Lough, 2017</a>).

<h6 class="h6">Blood Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Systemic arterial BP is the pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries during ventricular systole and diastole. It is affected by factors such as cardiac output; distention of the arteries; and the volume, velocity, and viscosity of the blood. A normal adult BP is considered a systolic BP less than 120 mm Hg over a diastolic BP less than 80 mm Hg. High BP, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; blood pressure that is persistently greater than 130/80 mm Hg">hypertension</button></strong>, is defined in two stages and is based upon BP taken on at least two instances. Stage 1 hypertension is a systolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP between 80 and 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is a systolic BP over 140 mm Hg or a diastolic over 90 mm Hg (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1680">Whelton, Carey, Aronow, et al., 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypotension:&lt;/b&gt; a decrease in blood pressure to less than 90/60 mm Hg that compromises systemic perfusion">Hypotension</button></strong> refers to an abnormally low systolic and diastolic BP that can result in lightheadedness or fainting. (See <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> for additional definitions, measurement, and management.)</p>
<p class="h7">Pulse Pressure</p>
<p class="nonindent">The difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressures is called the <em>pulse pressure.</em> A normal pulse pressure is 40 mm Hg. A narrow pulse pressure (e.g., BP of 92/74 mm Hg and pulse pressure of 18 mm Hg) occurs when there is vasoconstriction that is compensating for a low stroke volume and ejection velocity (shock, HF, hypovolemia, mitral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page666" title="666"></span>regurgitation) or obstruction to blood flow during systole (mitral or aortic stenosis). This compensation allows for adequate organ perfusion. A wide pulse pressure (e.g., BP of 88/38 mm Hg and pulse pressure of 50 mm Hg) is associated with conditions that elevate the stroke volume (anxiety, exercise, bradycardia), or cause vasodilation (fever, septic shock). Abnormal pulse pressures require further cardiovascular assessment (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Urden et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Orthostatic (Postural) Blood Pressure Changes</p>
<p class="nonindent">There is a gravitational redistribution of approximately 500 mL of blood into the lower extremities immediately upon standing. This venous pooling reduces blood return to the heart, compromising preload that ultimately reduces stroke volume and cardiac output. As a consequence, the autonomic nervous system is activated. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate and enhances peripheral vasoconstriction, whereas parasympathetic activity of the heart via the vagus nerve is decreased. This stabilization occurs within 1 minute (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1673">Ricci, De Caterina, &#x0026; Fedorowski, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Normal postural responses that occur when a person moves from a lying to a standing position include (1) a heart rate increase of 5 to 20 bpm above the resting rate; (2) an unchanged systolic pressure, or a slight decrease of up to 10 mm Hg; and (3) a slight increase of 5 mm Hg in diastolic pressure.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Orthostatic (postural) hypotension</strong> is a sustained decrease of at least 20 mm Hg in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP within 3 minutes of moving from a lying or sitting to a standing position. It is usually accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope. The risk of orthostatic hypotension increases with age and is associated with fall risk (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Ricci et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Orthostatic hypotension in patients with CVD is most often due to a significant reduction in preload, which compromises cardiac output. Reduced preload, which is reflective of intravascular volume depletion, is caused by dehydration from overdiuresis, bleeding (due to antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications or post intravascular procedures), or medications that dilate the blood vessels (e.g., nitrates and antispasmodic agents). In these situations, the usual mechanisms needed to maintain cardiac output (increased heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction) cannot compensate for the significant loss in intravascular volume. As a result, the BP drops and heart rate increases with changes from lying or sitting to upright positions (<a href="#ct21-3">Chart&#x00A0;21-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The following is an example of BP and heart rate measurements in a patient with orthostatic hypotension:</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Supine:</em> BP 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate 70 bpm</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Sitting:</em> BP 100/55 mm Hg, heart rate 90 bpm</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Standing:</em> BP 98/52 mm Hg, heart rate 94 bpm</p>
<h6 class="h6">Arterial Pulses</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The arteries are palpated to evaluate the pulse rate, rhythm, amplitude, contour, and obstruction to blood flow.</p>
<p class="h7">Pulse Rate</p>
<p class="nonindent">The normal pulse rate varies from a low of 50 bpm in healthy, athletic young adults to rates well in excess of 100 bpm after exercise or during times of excitement. Anxiety can raise the pulse rate during the physical examination. If the rate is higher than expected, the nurse should reassess the pulse near the end of the physical examination, when the patient may be more relaxed.</p>

<div class="box3">
<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong><strong>Assessing Patients for Orthostatic Hypotension</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following steps are recommended when assessing patients for orthostatic hypotension:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Position the patient supine for 10 minutes before taking the initial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate measurements.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Reposition the patient to a sitting position with legs in the dependent position, wait 2 minutes, then reassess both BP and heart rate measurements.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the patient is symptom free or has no significant decreases in systolic or diastolic BP, assist the patient into a standing position, obtain measurements immediately, and recheck in 2 minutes; continue measurements every 2 minutes for a total of 10 minutes to rule out orthostatic hypotension.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Return the patient to a supine position if orthostatic hypotension is detected or if the patient becomes symptomatic.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Document heart rate and BP measured in each position (e.g., supine, sitting, standing) and any signs or symptoms that accompany the postural changes.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Pulse Rhythm</p>
<p class="nonindent">The rhythm of the pulse is normally regular. Minor variations in regularity of the pulse may occur with respirations. The pulse rate may increase during inhalation and slow during exhalation due to changes in blood flow to the heart during the respiratory cycle. This phenomenon, called <em>sinus arrhythmia,</em> occurs most commonly in children and young adults.</p>
<p class="indent">For the initial cardiac examination, or if the pulse rhythm is irregular, the heart rate should be counted by auscultating the apical pulse, located at the PMI, for a full minute while simultaneously palpating the radial pulse. Any discrepancy between contractions heard and pulses felt is noted. Disturbances of rhythm (arrhythmias) often result in a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pulse deficit:&lt;/b&gt; the difference between the apical and radial pulse rates">pulse deficit</button></strong>, which is a difference between the apical and radial pulse rates. Pulse deficits commonly occur with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and premature ventricular contractions. These arrhythmias stimulate the ventricles to contact prematurely, before diastole is finished. As a result, these early ventricular contractions produce a smaller stroke volume, which can be heard during auscultation but do not produce a palpable pulse (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> for a detailed discussion of these arrhythmias).</p>
<p class="h7">Pulse Amplitude</p>
<p class="nonindent">The pulse amplitude, indicative of the BP in the artery, is used to assess peripheral arterial circulation. The nurse assesses pulse amplitude bilaterally and describes and records the amplitude of each artery. The simplest method characterizes the pulse as absent, diminished, normal, or bounding. Scales <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page667" title="667"></span>are also used to rate the strength of the pulse. The following is an example of a 0 to 4 scale:</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21">0: Not palpable or absent</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21">+1: Diminished&#x2014;weak, thready pulse; difficult to palpate; obliterated with pressure</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21">+2: Normal&#x2014;cannot be obliterated</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21">+3: Moderately increased&#x2014;easy to palpate, full pulse; cannot be obliterated</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21">+4: Markedly increased&#x2014;strong, bounding pulse; may be abnormal</p>
<p class="indent">The numerical classification is subjective; therefore, when documenting the pulse amplitude, specify location of the artery and scale range (e.g., &#x201C;left radial +3/+4&#x201D;) (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the pulse is absent or difficult to palpate, the nurse can use a continuous wave Doppler. This portable ultrasound device has a transducer that is placed over the artery. The transducer emits and receives ultrasound beams. Rhythmic changes are heard as blood cells flow through patent arteries, whereas obstruction to blood flow is evidenced by no changes in sound. (Ultrasound techniques are discussed in more detail in <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>.)</p>
<p class="h7">Pulse Contour</p>
<p class="nonindent">The contour of the pulse conveys important information. In patients with stenosis of the aortic valve, the valve opening is narrowed, reducing the amount of blood ejected into the aorta. The pulse pressure is narrow, and the pulse feels feeble. In aortic insufficiency, the aortic valve does not close completely, allowing blood to flow back from the aorta into the left ventricle. The rise of the pulse wave is abrupt and strong, and its fall is precipitous&#x2014;a &#x201C;collapsing&#x201D; or &#x201C;water hammer&#x201D; pulse. The true contour of the pulse is best appreciated by palpating over the carotid artery rather than the distal radial artery, because the dramatic characteristics of the pulse wave may be distorted when the pulse is transmitted to smaller vessels.</p>
<p class="h7">Palpation of Arterial Pulses</p>
<p class="nonindent">To assess peripheral circulation, the nurse locates and evaluates all arterial pulses. Arterial pulses are palpated at points where the arteries are near the skin surface and are easily compressed against bones or firm musculature. Pulses are detected over the right and left temporal, common carotid, brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, <a href="c26-sec03.xhtml#ff26-2">Fig.&#x00A0;26-2</a>). A reliable assessment of the pulses depends on accurate identification of the location of the artery and careful palpation of the area. Light palpation is essential; firm finger pressure can obliterate the temporal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses and confuse the examiner. In approximately 10% of patients, the dorsalis pedis pulses are not palpable (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). In such circumstances, both are usually absent and the posterior tibial arteries alone provide adequate blood supply to the feet. Arteries in the extremities are often palpated simultaneously to facilitate comparison of quality.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Do not simultaneously palpate both the temporal and carotid arteries, because it is possible to decrease the blood flow to the brain.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Jugular Venous Pulsations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Right-sided heart function can be estimated by observing the pulsations of the jugular veins of the neck, which reflects central venous pressure (CVP). CVP is the pressure in the right atria or the right ventricle at the end of diastole. If the internal jugular pulsations are difficult to see, pulsations of the external jugular veins may be noted. These veins are more superficial and are visible just above the clavicles, adjacent to the sternocleidomastoid muscles.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with euvolemia (normal blood volume), the jugular veins are normally visible in the supine position with the head of the bed elevated to 30 degrees (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Bickley, 2017</a>). Obvious distention of the veins with the patient&#x2019;s head elevated 45 to 90 degrees indicates an abnormal increase in CVP. This abnormality is observed in patients with right-sided HF, due to hypervolemia, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary stenosis; less commonly with obstruction of blood flow in the superior vena cava; and rarely with acute massive pulmonary embolism.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The heart is examined by inspection, palpation, and auscultation of the precordium or anterior chest wall that covers the heart and lower thorax. A systematic approach is used to examine the precordium in the following six areas. <a href="#ff21-5">Figure&#x00A0;21-5</a> identifies these important landmarks:</p>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span><em>Aortic area&#x2014;</em>second intercostal space to the right of the sternum. To determine the correct intercostal space, the nurse first finds the angle of Louis by locating the bony ridge near the top of the sternum, at the junction of the sternum and the manubrium. From this angle, the second intercostal space is located by sliding one finger to the left or right of the sternum. Subsequent intercostal spaces are located from this reference point by palpating down the rib cage.</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span><em>Pulmonic area&#x2014;</em>second intercostal space to the left of the sternum</p>

<p class="indent">For most of the examination, the patient lies supine, with the head of the bed or the examination table slightly elevated. A right-handed examiner stands at the right side of the patient, a left-handed examiner at the left side.</p>
<p class="indent">Each area of the precordium is inspected for pulsations and is then palpated. An apical impulse is a normal finding observed in young patients and adults who have thin chest walls.</p>
<p class="indent">The apical impulse may be felt as a light pulsation, 1 to 2 cm in diameter. It is felt at the onset of the first heart sound and lasts for only half of ventricular systole (see the next section for a discussion of heart sounds). The nurse uses the palm of the hand to locate the apical impulse initially and the finger pads to assess its size and quality. Palpation of the apical pulse may be facilitated by repositioning the patient to the left lateral position, which puts the heart in closer contact with the chest wall (<a href="#ff21-6">Fig.&#x00A0;21-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are several abnormalities that the nurse may find during palpation of the precordium. Normally, the apical impulse is palpable in only one intercostal space; palpability in two or more adjacent intercostal spaces indicates left ventricular enlargement. An apical impulse below the fifth intercostal space or lateral to the midclavicular line usually denotes left ventricular enlargement from left ventricular HF. If the apical impulse can be palpated in two distinctly separate areas and the pulsation movements are paradoxical (not simultaneous), a ventricular aneurysm may be suspected. A broad and forceful apical impulse is known as a left ventricular heave or lift because it appears to lift the hand from the chest wall during palpation.</p>
<p class="indent">A vibration or purring sensation may be felt over areas where abnormal, turbulent blood flow is present. It is best detected by using the palm of the hand. This vibration is called a <em>thrill</em> and is associated with a loud murmur. Depending on the location of the thrill, it may be indicative of serious valvular heart disease; an atrial or ventricular septal defect (abnormal opening); or stenosis of a large artery, such as the carotid artery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Heart Auscultation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A stethoscope is used to auscultate each of the locations identified in <a href="#ff21-5">Figure&#x00A0;21-5</a>, with the exception of the epigastric area. The purpose of cardiac auscultation is to determine heart rate and rhythm and evaluate heart sounds. The apical area is auscultated for 1 minute to determine the apical pulse rate and the regularity of the heartbeat. Normal and abnormal heart sounds detected during auscultation are described next.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;normal heart sounds:&lt;/b&gt; sounds produced when the valves close; normal heart sounds are S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (atrioventricular valves) and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (semilunar valves)">Normal heart sounds</button></strong>, referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; the first heart sound produced by closure of the atrioventricular (mitral and tricuspid) valves">S<sub>1</sub></button></strong> and <strong>S</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong>, are produced by closure of the AV valves and the semilunar valves, respectively. The period between S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> corresponds with ventricular systole (<a href="#ff21-7">Fig.&#x00A0;21-7</a>). When the heart rate is within the normal range, systole is much shorter than the period between S<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> (diastole). However, as the heart rate increases, diastole shortens.</p>
<p class="indent">Normally, S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> are the only sounds heard during the cardiac cycle (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Tricuspid and mitral valve closure creates the first heart sound (S<sub>1</sub>). The word &#x201C;lub&#x201D; is used to replicate its sound. S<sub>1</sub> is usually heard the loudest at the apical area. S<sub>1</sub> is easily identifiable and serves as the point of reference for the remainder of the cardiac cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">The intensity of S<sub>1</sub> increases during tachycardias or with mitral stenosis. In these circumstances, the AV valves are wide open during ventricular contraction. The accentuated S<sub>1</sub> occurs as the AV valves close with greater force than normal. Similarly, arrhythmias can vary the intensity of S<sub>1</sub> from beat to beat due to lack of synchronized atrial and ventricular contraction.</p>
<p class="h8">S<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Second Heart Sound</p>
<p class="nonindent">Closure of the pulmonic and aortic valves produces the second heart sound (S<sub>2</sub>), commonly referred to as the &#x201C;dub&#x201D; sound. The aortic component of S<sub>2</sub> is heard the loudest over the aortic and pulmonic areas. However, the pulmonic component of S<sub>2</sub> is a softer sound and is heard best over the pulmonic area.</p>

The first heart sound (S<sub>1</sub>) is produced by closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves (&#x201C;lub&#x201D;). The second heart sound (S<sub>2</sub>) is produced by closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves (&#x201C;dub&#x201D;). <em>Arrows</em> represent the direction of blood flow.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Although these valves close almost simultaneously, the pulmonic valve lags slightly behind the aortic valve. In some individuals, it is possible to distinguish between the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. When this situation occurs, the patient is said to have a split S<sub>2</sub>. Normal physiologic splitting of S<sub>2</sub> is accentuated on inspiration and disappears on expiration. During inspiration, there is a decrease in intrathoracic pressure and subsequent increase in venous return to the right atrium and ventricle. The right ventricle takes a little longer to eject this extra volume, which causes the pulmonic valve to close a little later than normal. Splitting of S<sub>2</sub> that remains constant during inspiration and expiration is an abnormal finding. Abnormal splitting of the second heart sound can be caused by a variety of disease states (valvular heart disease, septal defects, bundle branch blocks). Splitting of S<sub>2</sub> is best heard over the pulmonic area.</p>
<p class="h7">Abnormal Heart Sounds</p>
<p class="nonindent">Abnormal sounds develop during systole or diastole when structural or functional heart problems are present. These sounds are called <strong>S</strong><strong><sub>3</sub></strong> or <strong>S</strong><strong><sub>4</sub></strong> gallops, opening snaps, systolic clicks, and murmurs. S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub> gallop sounds are heard during diastole. These sounds are created by the vibration of the ventricle and surrounding structures as blood meets resistance during ventricular filling. The term <em>gallop</em> evolved from the cadence that is produced by the addition of a third or fourth heart sound, similar to the sound of a galloping horse. Gallop sounds are very low-frequency sounds and are heard with the bell of the stethoscope placed very lightly against the chest.</p>
<p class="h8">S<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;Third Heart Sound</p>
<p class="nonindent">An S<sub>3</sub> (&#x201C;DUB&#x201D;) is heard early in diastole during the period of rapid ventricular filling as blood flows from the atrium into a noncompliant ventricle. It is heard immediately after S<sub>2</sub>. &#x201C;Lub-dub-DUB&#x201D; is used to imitate the abnormal sound of a beating heart when an S<sub>3</sub> is present. It represents a normal finding in children and adults up to 35 or 40 years of age. In these cases, it is referred to as a physiologic S<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#ff21-8">Fig.&#x00A0;21-8</a>). In older adults, an S<sub>3</sub> is a significant finding, suggesting HF. It is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. If the right <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page670" title="670"></span>ventricle is involved, a right-sided S<sub>3</sub> is heard over the tricuspid area with the patient in a supine position. A left-sided S<sub>3</sub> is best heard over the apical area with the patient in the left lateral position.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff21-8">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff21-8.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff21-8.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;21-8 &#x2022;</span> Gallop sounds. An S<sub>3</sub> (&#x201C;DUB&#x201D;) is an abnormal sound heard immediately following S<sub>2</sub> (closure of semilunar valves). This sound is generated very early in diastole as blood flowing into the right or left ventricle is met with resistance. S<sub>4</sub> (&#x201C;LUB&#x201D;) is an abnormal sound created during atrial systole as blood flowing into the right or left ventricle is met with resistance. <em>Arrows</em> represent the direction of blood flow.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h8">S<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;Fourth Heart Sound</p>
<p class="nonindent">S<sub>4</sub> (&#x201C;LUB&#x201D;) occurs late in diastole (see <a href="#ff21-8">Fig.&#x00A0;21-8</a>). S<sub>4</sub> heard just before S<sub>1</sub> is generated during atrial contraction as blood forcefully enters a noncompliant ventricle. This resistance to blood flow is due to ventricular hypertrophy caused by hypertension, CAD, cardiomyopathies, aortic stenosis, and numerous other conditions. &#x201C;LUB lub-dub&#x201D; is the mnemonic used to imitate this gallop sound. S<sub>4</sub>, produced in the left ventricle, is auscultated using the bell of the stethoscope over the apical area with the patient in the left lateral position. A right-sided S<sub>4</sub>, although less common, is heard best over the tricuspid area with the patient in supine position. There are times when both S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub> are present, creating a quadruple rhythm, which sounds like &#x201C;LUB lub-dub DUB.&#x201D; During tachycardia, all four sounds combine into a loud sound, referred to as a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;summation gallop:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal sounds created by the presence of an S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; during periods of tachycardia">summation gallop</button></strong>.</p>
<p class="h8">Opening Snaps and Systolic Clicks</p>
<p class="nonindent">Normally, no sound is produced when valves open. However, diseased valve leaflets create abnormal sounds as they open during diastole or systole. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;opening snaps:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal diastolic sounds generated during opening of rigid atrioventricular valve leaflets">Opening snaps</button></strong> are abnormal diastolic sounds heard during opening of an AV valve. For example, mitral stenosis can cause an opening snap, which is an unusually high-pitched sound very early in diastole. This sound is caused by high pressure in the left atrium that abruptly displaces or &#x201C;snaps&#x201D; open a rigid valve leaflet. Timing helps to distinguish an opening snap from the other gallop sounds. It occurs too long after S<sub>2</sub> to be mistaken for a split S<sub>2</sub> and too early in diastole to be mistaken for an S<sub>3</sub>. The high-pitched, snapping quality of the sound is another way to differentiate an opening snap from an S<sub>3</sub>. Hearing a murmur or the sound of turbulent blood flow is expected following the opening snap. An opening snap is heard best using the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed medial to the apical area and along the lower left sternal border.</p>
<p class="indent">In a similar manner, stenosis of one of the semilunar valves creates a short, high-pitched sound in early systole, immediately after S<sub>1</sub>. This sound, called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;systolic click:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal systolic sound created by the opening of a calcified aortic or pulmonic valve during ventricular contraction">systolic click</button></strong>, is the result of the opening of a rigid and calcified aortic or pulmonic valve during ventricular contraction. Mid to late systolic clicks may be heard in patients with mitral or tricuspid valve prolapse as the malfunctioning valve leaflet is displaced into the atrium during ventricular systole. Murmurs are expected to be heard following these abnormal systolic sounds. These sounds are the loudest in the areas directly over the malfunctioning valve.</p>
<p class="h8">Murmurs</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;murmurs:&lt;/b&gt; sounds created by abnormal, turbulent flow of blood in the heart">Murmurs</button></strong> are created by turbulent flow of blood in the heart. The causes of the turbulence may be a critically narrowed valve, a malfunctioning valve that allows regurgitant blood flow, a congenital defect of the ventricular wall, a defect between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, or an increased flow of blood through a normal structure (e.g., with fever, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism). Murmurs are characterized and consequently described by several characteristics, including their timing in the cardiac cycle, location on the chest wall, intensity, pitch, quality, and pattern of radiation (<a href="#ct21-4">Chart&#x00A0;21-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Friction Rub</p>
<p class="nonindent">A harsh, grating sound that can be heard in both systole and diastole is called a <em>friction rub.</em> It is caused by abrasion of the inflamed pericardial surfaces from pericarditis. Because a friction rub may be confused with a murmur, care should be taken to identify the sound and to distinguish it from murmurs that may be heard in both systole and diastole. A pericardial friction rub can be heard best using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, with the patient sitting up and leaning forward.</p>
<p class="h7">Auscultation Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">During auscultation, the patient remains supine and the examining room is as quiet as possible. A stethoscope with both diaphragm and bell functions is necessary for accurate auscultation of the heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, the examiner starts at the apical area and progresses upward along the left sternal border to the pulmonic and aortic areas. Alternatively, the examiner may begin the examination at the aortic and pulmonic areas and progress downward to the apex of the heart. Initially, S<sub>1</sub> is identified and evaluated with respect to its intensity and splitting. Next, S<sub>2</sub> is identified, and its intensity and any splitting are noted. After concentrating on S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, the examiner listens for extra sounds in systole and then in diastole.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it helps to ask the following questions: Do I hear snapping or clicking sounds? Do I hear any high-pitched blowing sounds? Is this sound in systole, or diastole, or both? The examiner again proceeds to move the stethoscope to all of the designated areas of the precordium, listening carefully for these sounds. Finally, the patient is turned on the left side and the stethoscope is placed on the apical area, where an S<sub>3</sub>, an S<sub>4</sub>, and a mitral murmur are more readily detected.</p>
<p class="indent">Once an abnormality is heard, the entire chest surface is reexamined to determine the exact location of the sound and its radiation. The patient may be concerned about the prolonged examination and must be supported and reassured. The auscultatory findings, particularly murmurs, are documented by identifying the following characteristics (see <a href="#ct21-4">Chart&#x00A0;21-4</a>): location on chest wall, timing, intensity, pitch, quality, and radiation.</p>
<p class="h7">Interpretation of Heart Sounds</p>
<p class="nonindent">Interpreting heart sounds requires detailed knowledge of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. However, all nurses should have adequate knowledge and skill to recognize normal heart sounds (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) and the presence of abnormal sounds. When assessment is at this very basic level of practice, abnormal findings are reported for further evaluation and treatment. More advanced skills are required of nurses caring for critically ill patients with CVD or those nurses functioning in advanced practice roles. Nurses in these roles readily identify abnormal heart sounds, recognize the diagnostic significance of their findings, and use their assessment skills to evaluate patients&#x2019; responses to medical interventions. For example, these highly skilled nurses monitor heart <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page671" title="671"></span>sounds in patients with HF to detect the resolution of an S<sub>3</sub> after treatment with a diuretic.</p>

<p class="BoxpNumber" id="ct21-4"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;21-4</strong></p></div>
<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Characteristics of Heart Murmurs</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Heart murmurs are described in terms of location, timing, intensity, pitch, quality, and radiation. These characteristics provide information needed to determine the cause of the murmur and its clinical significance.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Pinpointing the location of the murmur helps to determine the underlying structures that are involved in generating the abnormal sounds. The locations described in <a href="#ff21-5">Figure&#x00A0;21-5</a> are used to identify where the loudest sounds are detected. The description should include the exact location from which the sound emanates, such as the location of the intercostal space and other important landmarks (right or left sternal border; midsternal, midclavicular, anterior axillary, or midaxillary lines). For example, a ventricular septal defect can be located at the left sternal border in the third and fourth intercostal spaces.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Timing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A murmur is described in terms of when it occurs during the cardiac cycle (systole or diastole). Murmurs are further differentiated by identifying exactly when during systole or diastole they are heard. A skilled clinician can detect that the murmur is occurring during early, mid, or late systole or diastole. Some murmurs have sounds that occur in both systole and diastole.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Intensity</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A grading system is used to describe the intensity or loudness of a murmur.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First"><em>Grade 1:</em> Very faint and difficult for the inexperienced clinician to hear</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><em>Grade 2:</em> Quiet but readily perceived by the experienced primary provider</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><em>Grade 3:</em> Moderately loud</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><em>Grade 4:</em> Loud and may be associated with a thrill</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><em>Grade 5:</em> Very loud; heard when stethoscope is partially off the chest; associated with a thrill</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Last"><em>Grade 6:</em> Extremely loud; detected with the stethoscope off the chest; associated with a thrill</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Pitch</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Pitch describes the sound frequency, identified as high, medium, or low pitched. High-pitched murmurs are heard best with the stethoscope&#x2019;s diaphragm, whereas low-pitched sounds are detected using the bell of the stethoscope placed lightly on the chest wall.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Quality</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Quality describes the sound that the murmur resembles. Murmurs can produce a rumbling, blowing, whistling, harsh, or musical sound. For example, murmurs caused by mitral or tricuspid regurgitation have a blowing quality, whereas mitral stenosis generates a rumbling sound.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;radiation therapy:&lt;/b&gt; the use of ionizing radiation to kill malignant cells">Radiation</button></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Radiation refers to the transmission of the murmur from the point of maximal intensity to other areas in the upper chest. The examiner determines if radiation is present by listening carefully to areas of the heart adjacent to the point where the murmur is the loudest. If radiation is present, the exact location is described. A murmur associated with aortic stenosis, for example, can radiate into the neck, down the left sternal border, and into the apical area.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Assessment of Other Systems</h6>
<p class="h7a">Lungs</p>
<p class="nonindent">The details of respiratory assessment are described in <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>. Findings frequently exhibited by patients with cardiac disorders include the following:</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Hemoptysis:</em> Pink, frothy sputum is indicative of acute pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Cough:</em> A dry, hacking cough from irritation of small airways is common in patients with pulmonary congestion from HF.</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Crackles:</em> HF or atelectasis associated with bed rest, splinting from ischemic pain, or the effects of analgesic, sedative, or anesthetic agents often results in the development of crackles. Typically, crackles are first noted at the bases (because of gravity&#x2019;s effect on fluid accumulation and decreased ventilation of basilar tissue), but they may progress to all portions of the lung fields.</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Wheezes:</em> Compression of the small airways by interstitial pulmonary edema may cause wheezing. Beta-adrenergic&#x2013;blocking agents (beta-blockers), particularly noncardioselective beta-adrenergic&#x2013;blocking agents such as propranolol, may cause airway narrowing, especially in patients with underlying pulmonary disease.</p>
<p class="h7">Abdomen</p>
<p class="nonindent">For the patient with CVD, several components of the abdominal examination are relevant:</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Abdominal distention:</em> A protuberant abdomen with bulging flanks indicates ascites. Ascites develops in patients with right ventricular or biventricular HF (both right- and left-sided HF). In the failing right heart, abnormally high chamber pressures impede the return of venous blood. As a result, the liver and spleen become engorged with excessive venous blood (hepatosplenomegaly). As pressure in the portal system rises, fluid shifts from the vascular bed into the abdominal cavity. Ascitic fluid, found in the dependent or lowest points in the abdomen, will shift with position changes.</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Hepatojugular reflux:</em> This test is performed when right ventricular or biventricular HF is suspected. The patient is positioned so that the jugular venous pulse is visible in the lower part of the neck. While observing the jugular venous pulse, firm pressure is applied over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for 30 to 60 seconds. An increase of 1 cm or more in jugular venous pressure is indicative of a positive hepatojugular reflux. This positive test aids in confirming the diagnosis of HF.</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Bladder distention:</em> Urine output is an important indicator of cardiac function. Reduced urine output may indicate inadequate renal perfusion or a less serious problem such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page672" title="672"></span>as one caused by urinary retention. When urine output is decreased, the patient must be assessed for a distended bladder or difficulty voiding. The bladder may be assessed with an ultrasound scanner (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>, <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#ff47-8">Fig.&#x00A0;47-8</a>) or the suprapubic area palpated for an oval mass and percussed for dullness, indicative of a full bladder.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/xxiii-6.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When performing a cardiovascular examination on an older patient, the nurse may note such differences as more readily palpable peripheral pulses because of decreased elasticity of the arteries and a loss of adjacent connective tissue. Palpation of the precordium in older adults is affected by the changes in the shape of the chest. For example, a cardiac impulse may not be palpable in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because these patients usually have an increased anterior&#x2013;posterior chest diameter. Kyphoscoliosis, a spinal deformity that occurs in many older adult patients, may move the cardiac apex downward so that palpation of the apical impulse is obscured.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypertension affects 46% of adults. The prevalence increases with age and is also impacted by race and ethnicity. The risk of a middle-age adult developing hypertension is over 90% for African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. Untreated hypertension is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including stroke (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Whelton et al., 2018</a>). Isolated systolic hypertension is of concern in adults over 55 year of age, and occurs because of stiffening of the vasculature and a decrease in vascular elasticity due to the aging process (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Zipes et al., 2019</a>). Another common BP problem in the older adult is orthostatic hypotension, which is a result of impaired baroreceptor function necessary to regulate BP. Other factors that heighten the risk for orthostatic hypotension include prolonged bed rest, dehydration, and many cardiovascular medications (e.g., beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, nitrates).</p>
<p class="indent">An S<sub>4</sub> that is associated with hypertension is common in older adults. It is thought to be due to a decrease in compliance of the left ventricle. The S<sub>2</sub> is usually split. At least 60% of older patients have murmurs, the most common being a soft systolic ejection murmur resulting from sclerotic changes of the aortic leaflets (<a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#bib1690">Bickley, 2017</a>) (see <a href="#tt21-1">Table&#x00A0;21-1</a>).</p>
