<p class="nonindent">Autologous reconstruction is the use of the patient&#x2019;s own tissue to create a breast mound. A flap of skin, fat, and muscle with its attached blood supply is rotated to the mastectomy site to create a mound that simulates the breast. Donor sites may include the <strong>transverse rectus abdominal myocutaneous (TRAM) flap</strong> (abdominal muscle) (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-7">Fig.&#x00A0;52-7</a></span>), gluteal flap (buttock muscle), or the latissimus dorsi flap (back muscle) (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-8">Fig.&#x00A0;52-8</a></span>). The results more closely resemble a real breast <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1737" title="1737"></span>because the skin and fat from the donor sites are similar in consistency to a natural breast. These procedures avoid the use of synthetic material. However, they involve longer recuperation than a tissue expander procedure. The risk of potential complications (e.g., infection, bleeding, flap necrosis) is also greater. Therefore, patients must be in relatively good health, and those with medical conditions (e.g., atherosclerosis, pulmonary disease, heart failure) that affect circulation or compromise oxygen delivery are not good candidates. Other candidates who are poor risks include those with poorly controlled diabetes or morbid obesity and those who smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">The TRAM flap is the most commonly performed tissue transfer procedure. A free TRAM procedure may also be performed; in this case, the skin, fat, muscle, and blood supply are completely detached from the body and then transplanted to the mastectomy site using microvascular surgery (the use of a microscope to reconnect the vessels). Postoperatively, patients who have undergone TRAM procedures often face a lengthy recovery (often 6 to 8 weeks) and have incisions both at the mastectomy site and at the donor site in the abdomen. Other free flap procedures include deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap and superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) flap depending on whether the superior gluteal artery perforator or the inferior one is utilized. Free flaps involve microsurgery for blood vessel transfer.</p>
<p class="indent">Deep breathing and leg exercises are essential because the patient is more limited in her activity and is at greater risk for respiratory complications and DVT. Measures to help the patient reduce tension on the abdominal incision during the first postoperative week include elevating the head of the bed 45 degrees and flexing the patient&#x2019;s knees.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the patient is able to ambulate, she can protect the surgical incision by splinting it and will gradually achieve a more upright position. The patient is instructed to avoid high-impact activities and lifting (more than 5 to 10 lb for 6 to 8 weeks after surgery) to prevent stress on the incision.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2478">Nipple&#x2013;Areola Reconstruction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After the breast mound has been created and the site has healed, some women choose to have nipple&#x2013;areola reconstruction. This is a minor surgical procedure carried out either in the physician&#x2019;s office or at an outpatient surgical facility. The most common method of creating a nipple is with the use of local flaps (skin and fat from the center of the new breast mound), which are wrapped around each other to create a projecting nipple. The areola is created using a skin graft. The most common donor site is the upper inner thigh, because this skin has darker pigmentation than the skin on the reconstructed breast. After the nipple graft has healed, micropigmentation (tattooing) can be performed to achieve a more natural color. The surgeon can usually match the reconstructed nipple&#x2013;areola complex with that of the contralateral breast for an acceptable cosmetic result.</p>
