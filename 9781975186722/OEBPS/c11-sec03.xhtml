<h4 class="h4" id="s337">General Management Strategies in Shock</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As described previously and in the discussion of types of shock to follow, management in all types and all phases of shock includes the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Support of the respiratory system with supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation to provide optimal oxygenation (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>)</span></li>
<li><span>Fluid replacement to restore intravascular volume</span></li>
<li><span>Vasoactive medications to restore vasomotor tone and improve cardiac function</span></li>
<li><span>Nutritional support to address the metabolic requirements that are often dramatically increased in shock</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Therapies described in this section require collaboration among all members of the health care team.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s338">Fluid Replacement</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid replacement, also referred to as fluid resuscitation, is given in all types of shock. The type of fluids administered, and the speed of delivery vary; however, fluids are given to improve cardiac and tissue oxygenation, which in part depends on flow. The fluids given may include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;crystalloids:&lt;/b&gt; intravenous electrolyte solutions that move freely between the intravascular compartment and interstitial spaces">crystalloids</button></strong> (electrolyte solutions that move freely between intravascular compartment and interstitial spaces), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;colloids:&lt;/b&gt; intravenous solutions that contain molecules that are too large to pass through capillary membranes">colloids</button></strong> (large-molecule IV solutions), and blood components (packed red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Crystalloid and Colloid Solutions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In emergencies, the &#x201C;best&#x201D; fluid is often the fluid that is readily available. Fluid resuscitation should be initiated early in shock to maximize intravascular volume. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are often selected because they contain the same concentration of electrolytes as the extracellular fluid and, therefore, can be given without altering the concentrations of electrolytes in the plasma. IV crystalloids commonly used for resuscitation in hypovolemic shock include 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline) and lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution. Lactated Ringer&#x2019;s is an electrolyte solution containing the lactate ion, which should not be confused with lactic acid. The lactate ion is converted to bicarbonate, which helps buffer the overall acidosis that occurs in shock. Lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution more closely resembles plasma and is considered a more appropriate first choice solution over 0.9% normal saline (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib862">de-Madaria, Herrera-Marante, Gonzalez-Camacho, et al., 2018</a>). While normal saline is an isotonic solution, large infusions may cause hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">de-Madaria et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib903">Sethi, Owyang, Meyers, et al., 2018</a>). Hypertonic crystalloid solution, often 3% sodium chloride, does not improve patient outcomes and may result in unintended complications and is not recommended as a fluid for resuscitation (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bauer, MacLaren, &#x0026; Erstad, 2019</a>). A disadvantage of using isotonic crystalloid solutions is that some of the volume given is lost to the interstitial compartment and some remains in the intravascular compartment. This occurs as a consequence of cellular permeability that occurs during shock. Diffusion of crystalloids into the interstitial space means that more fluid may need to be given than the amount lost to support tissue perfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib885">Lewis, Pritchard, Evans, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Care must be taken when rapidly administering isotonic crystalloids to avoid both underresuscitating and overresuscitating the patient in shock. Insufficient fluid replacement is associated with a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality from lack of tissue perfusion, whereas excessive fluid administration can cause systemic and pulmonary edema that progresses to ALI (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>), intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and MODS (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">ACS is a serious complication that may occur when large volumes of fluid are given. It may also occur after trauma, abdominal surgery, pancreatitis, or sepsis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Harrell &#x0026; Miller, 2017</a>). In ACS, fluid leaks into the intra-abdominal cavity, increasing pressure that is displaced onto surrounding vessels and organs. Venous return, preload, and cardiac output are compromised. The pressure also elevates the diaphragm, making it difficult to breathe effectively. The renal and GI systems also begin to show signs of dysfunction (e.g., decreased urine output, absent bowel sounds, intolerance of tube feeding). Abdominal compartment pressure can be measured. Normally, it is 0 to 5 mm Hg, and a pressure of 12 mm Hg is considered to be indicative of IAH (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Harrell &#x0026; Miller, 2017</a>). If ACS is present, interventions that usually include surgical decompression are necessary to relieve the pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, IV colloidal solutions are similar to plasma proteins, in that they contain molecules that are too large to pass through capillary membranes. Colloids expand intravascular volume by exerting oncotic pressure, thereby pulling fluid into the intravascular space, increasing intravascular volume. In addition, colloids have a longer duration of action than crystalloids, because the molecules remain within the intravascular compartment longer. Typically, if colloids are used to treat tissue hypoperfusion, albumin is the agent prescribed. Albumin is a plasma protein; an albumin solution is prepared from human plasma and is heated during production to reduce its potential to transmit disease. The disadvantage of albumin is its high cost compared to crystalloid solutions. Resuscitation with colloid solutions has not reduced the risk of morbidity or death compared to resuscitation with crystalloid solutions; moreover, colloids can be considerably more expensive than crystalloid solutions (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib852">Annane, Siami, Jaber, et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Lewis et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>With all colloidal solutions, side effects include the rare occurrence of anaphylactic reactions. Nurses must monitor patients closely.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Complications of Fluid Administration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Close monitoring of the patient during fluid replacement is necessary to identify side effects and complications. The most common and serious side effects of fluid replacement are cardiovascular overload, pulmonary edema, and ACS. The patient receiving fluid replacement must be monitored frequently for adequate urinary output, changes in mental status, skin perfusion, and changes in vital signs. Lung sounds are auscultated frequently to detect signs of fluid accumulation. Adventitious lung sounds, such as crackles, may indicate pulmonary edema and ALI and ARDS.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When administering large volumes of crystalloid solutions, the nurse must monitor the lungs for adventitious sounds, signs and symptoms of interstitial edema, work of breathing (i.e., increasing effort required for the patient to breathe, depth of breathing, respiratory rate), and changes in oxygen saturation.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Often, a CVP line is inserted (typically into the subclavian or jugular vein) and is advanced until the tip of the catheter rests near the junction of the SVC and the right atrium. CVP measurements have traditionally been used to assess preload in the right side of the heart and fluid responsiveness during shock states. However, research confirms there is no direct relationship between CVP, circulating blood volume, and fluid responsiveness; thus, CVP is no longer used as a reliable measure to guide fluid replacement therapy (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib882">Laher et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib888">Marik, Baram, &#x0026; Vahid, 2008</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib889">Marik &#x0026; Cavallazzi, 2013</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Simmons &#x0026; Ventetuolo, 2017</a>). CVP devices provide access for large volumes of fluid replacement, and administration of blood products and vasoactive agents. If CVP measurements are still used to evaluate fluid needs of the patient, assessment variables such as BP, urine output, heart rate, and PLR should be considered when interpreting the CVP for clinical decisions (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Laher et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Simmons &#x0026; Ventetuolo, 2017</a>). Some CVP catheters allow the monitoring of intravascular measures and venous oxygen levels. Assessment of venous oxygenation (venous oxygen saturation S<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub>, or Sc<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub> with a CVP line) may be helpful in evaluating the adequacy of intravascular volume (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib899">Rhodes et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib900">Rivers, McIntyre, Morro, et al., 2005</a>). Hemodynamic monitoring with arterial lines may be implemented to allow close monitoring of the patient&#x2019;s BP and tissue perfusion. A pulmonary artery catheter may be inserted to assist with closer monitoring of a patient&#x2019;s cardiac status as well as response to therapy. Advances in noninvasive or minimally invasive technology (e.g., esophageal Doppler, arterial pulse contour analysis, cardiac output devices, intrathoracic impedance monitoring) provide additional hemodynamic monitoring options (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Hallisey &#x0026; Greenwood, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Laher et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib915">Zhang et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). (For additional information about hemodynamic monitoring, see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Placement of central lines for fluid administration and monitoring requires collaborative practice between the provider and the nurse to ensure that all measures to prevent central line&#x2013;associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) are implemented. Several interventions aimed at preventing CLABSI should be implemented collaboratively while the central line is being placed as well as during ongoing nursing management of the central line itself. <a href="#ct11-2">Chart&#x00A0;11-2</a> describes the evidence-based (&#x201C;bundled&#x201D;) interventions that have been found to reduce CLABSI.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s339">Vasoactive Medication Therapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vasoactive medications are given in all forms of shock to improve the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic stability when fluid therapy alone cannot maintain adequate MAP. Specific medications are selected to correct the particular hemodynamic alteration that is impeding cardiac output. These medications help increase the strength of myocardial contractility, regulate the heart rate, reduce myocardial resistance, and initiate vasoconstriction.</p>
<p class="indent">Vasoactive medications are selected for their action on receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. These receptors are known as alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic receptors are further classified as beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. When alpha-adrenergic receptors are stimulated, blood vessels constrict in the cardiorespiratory and GI systems, skin, and kidneys. When beta-1 adrenergic receptors are stimulated, heart rate and myocardial contraction increase. When beta-2 adrenergic receptors are stimulated, vasodilation occurs in the heart and skeletal muscles, and the bronchioles relax. The medications used in treating shock consist of various combinations of vasoactive medications to maximize tissue perfusion by stimulating or blocking the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.</p>
<p class="indent">When vasoactive medications are given, vital signs must be monitored frequently (at least every 15 minutes until stable, or more often if indicated). Vasoactive medications should be given through a central venous line, because infiltration and extravasation of some vasoactive medications can cause tissue necrosis and sloughing (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Maclaren, Mueller, &#x0026; Dasta, 2019</a>). Individual medication dosages are usually titrated by the nurse, who adjusts drip rates on the basis of the prescribed dose and target outcome parameter (e.g., BP, heart rate) and the patient&#x2019;s response. Dosages are changed to maintain the MAP at a physiologic level that ensures adequate tissue perfusion (usually greater than 65 mm Hg).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Vasoactive medications should never be stopped abruptly, because this could cause severe hemodynamic instability, perpetuating the shock state.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Dosages of vasoactive medications must be tapered. When vasoactive medications are no longer needed or are necessary to a lesser extent, the infusion should be weaned with frequent monitoring of BP (e.g., every 15 minutes). <a href="#tt11-2">Table&#x00A0;11-2</a> presents some of the commonly prescribed vasoactive medications used in the treatment of shock.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s340">Nutritional Support</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nutritional support is an important aspect of care for critically ill patients. Increased metabolic rates during shock increase energy requirements and therefore caloric requirements. Patients in shock may require more than 3000 calories daily. The release of catecholamines early in the shock continuum causes rapid depletion of glycogen stores. Nutritional energy requirements are then met by breaking down lean body mass. In this catabolic process, skeletal muscle mass is broken down even when the patient has large stores of fat or adipose tissue. Loss of skeletal muscle greatly prolongs the patient&#x2019;s recovery time.</p>
<p class="indent">Parenteral or enteral nutritional support should be initiated as soon as possible. Enteral nutrition is preferred, promoting GI function through direct exposure to nutrients and limiting infectious complications associated with parenteral feeding (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib898">Reintam, Blaser, Starkopf, et al., 2017</a>). Implementation of an evidence-based enteral feeding protocol that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page284" title="284"></span>is tolerant of increased gastric residual volumes ensures the delivery of adequate nutrition to patients who are critically ill (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib912">Wang, Ding, Fang, et al., 2019</a>). Gastric residual volume does not predict a patient&#x2019;s risk of aspiration (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib912">Wang et al., 2019</a>). Implementing early enteral nutrition has been found to promote gut-mediated immunity, reduce metabolic response to stress, and improve overall patient morbidity and mortality (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Reintam et al., 2017</a>). (See <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for further discussion of monitoring gastric residual volumes.)</p>

<p class="BoxpPARA">Current best practices can include the implementation of specific evidence-based bundle interventions that when used together (i.e., as a &#x201C;bundle&#x201D;) improve patient outcomes. This chart outlines specific parameters for the central line bundled collaborative interventions that have been found to reduce central line&#x2013;associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>What are the five key elements of the central line bundle?</em></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hand hygiene</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Maximal sterile barrier precautions during line insertion (see later discussion)</p>

<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Daily review of line necessity, with prompt removal of unnecessary lines</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>When should hand hygiene be performed in the care of a patient with a central line?</em></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>All clinicians who provide care to the patient should adhere to good hand hygiene practices, particularly:</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before and after palpating the catheter insertion site</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>With all dressing changes to the intravascular catheter access site</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When hands are visibly soiled or contamination of hands is suspected</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before donning and after removing gloves</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>What changes can be made to improve hand hygiene?</em></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Implement a central line procedure checklist that requires that clinicians perform hand hygiene as an essential step in care.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Post signage stating the importance of hand hygiene.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizers prominently placed to facilitate hand hygiene practices.</p>

<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Provide patient and family education and engage family in hand hygiene practices during visitation.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>What are maximal sterile barrier precautions?</em></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>These are implemented during central line insertion:</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>For the primary provider, this means strict adherence with wearing a cap, mask, sterile gown, and sterile gloves. The cap should cover all hair, and the mask should cover the nose and the mouth tightly. The nurse should also wear a cap and a mask.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>For the patient, this means covering the patient from head to toe with a sterile drape, with a small opening for the site of insertion. If a full-size drape is not available, two drapes may be applied to cover the patient, or the operating room may be consulted to determine how to procure full-size sterile drapes, because these are routinely used in surgical settings.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Nurses should be empowered to enforce use of a central line checklist to be sure that all processes related to central line placement are properly executed for every line placed.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>Which antiseptic should be used to prepare the patient&#x2019;s skin for central line insertion?</em></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Chlorhexidine skin antisepsis has been proven to provide better skin antisepsis than other antiseptic agents, such as povidone&#x2013;iodine solution.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An alcohol chlorhexidine antiseptic should be applied using a back-and-forth friction scrub for at least 30 s; this should not be wiped or blotted dry.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The antiseptic solution should be allowed time to dry completely before the insertion site is punctured/accessed (approximately 2 min).</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA"><em>What nursing interventions are essential to reduce the risk of infection?</em></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Maintaining sterile technique when changing the central line dressing</p>

<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The time and date of central line placement should be recorded and evaluated by staff to aid in decision making.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The need for the central line access should be reviewed as part of multidisciplinary rounds.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>During these rounds, the &#x201C;line day&#x201D; should be stated to remind everyone how long the central line has been in place (e.g., &#x201C;Today is line day 6&#x201D;).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An appropriate time frame for regular review of the necessity for a central line should be identified, such as weekly, when central lines are placed for long-term use (e.g., chemotherapy, extended antibiotic administration).</p>
