<p class="nonindent">The eye is a sensitive, highly specialized sense organ subject to various disorders, many of which can lead to impaired vision. Impaired vision may affect individuals in many ways, including their independence in self-care, sense of self-esteem, safety, and overall quality of life. Many of the leading causes of visual impairment are associated with aging (e.g., cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration). Younger people are also at risk for eye disorders, particularly traumatic injuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment and management of patients with eye and vision disorders occur in various health care settings. In addition to understanding the prevention, treatment, and consequences of eye disorders, nurses in all settings assess visual acuity in patients at risk (e.g., older adults, those with hypertension, diabetes, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), refer patients to eye care specialists as appropriate, implement measures to prevent further visual loss, and help patients adapt to impaired vision.</p>
