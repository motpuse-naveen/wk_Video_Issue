<h4 class="h4" id="s2739">Vision Impairment and Blindness</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Vision impairment</em> is defined as having central visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better eye with the best possible correction. <em>Low vision</em> describes visual impairment that requires the use of devices and strategies to perform visual tasks.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;blindness:&lt;/b&gt; inability to see, defined as corrected visual acuity of 20/400 or less, or a visual field of no more than 20 degrees in the better eye">Blindness</button></strong> is having best possible corrected central visual acuity that can range from 20/400 to no light perception. The clinical definition of absolute blindness is the absence of light perception. Legal blindness is a condition of impaired vision and is defined as having central visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better eye with the best possible correction or whose widest visual field diameter is 20 degrees or less (Bright Focus Foundation, 2020b). This definition neither equates with functional ability nor classifies the degrees of visual impairment. Legal blindness ranges from an inability to perceive light to having some vision remaining. A person who meets the criteria for legal blindness may be eligible for government financial assistance through disability.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2740">Assessment and Diagnostic Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of vision impairment includes a thorough history and examination of distance and near visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, glare, color perception, and refraction. Specially designed, low-vision visual acuity charts are used to evaluate patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Patient Interview</h6>
<p class="nonindent">During history taking, the potential cause and duration of the patient&#x2019;s visual impairment are identified. Patients with retinitis pigmentosa, for example, have a genetic abnormality. Patients with diabetic macular edema typically have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1904" title="1904"></span>fluctuating visual acuity. Patients with macular degeneration have central acuity problems that cause difficulty in performing activities that require finer vision, such as reading. People with peripheral field defects have more difficulties with mobility. The patient&#x2019;s customary ADLs, medication regimen, habits (e.g., smoking), acceptance of the physical limitations brought about by the visual impairment, and realistic expectations of low-vision aids are identified and included in the plan of care, as well as provision of guidelines for safety and referrals to social services.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Contrast-Sensitivity Testing and Glare Testing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Contrast-sensitivity testing measures visual acuity in different degrees of light and dark contrast to determine visual function. Glare testing is also used to determine visual function. Glare can reduce a person&#x2019;s ability to see, especially in patients with cataracts. Those affected by loss of contrast sensitivity and glare have difficulty functioning in low light, or driving at night or in foggy conditions. People with a loss of contrast sensitivity may benefit from better illumination.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2741"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately half of all individuals who are identified as legally blind each year are 65 years of age or older (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). With aging, structural and functional changes occur in the eye (see <a href="#ct58-3">Chart 58-3</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;presbyopia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in visual accommodation that occurs with advancing age">Presbyopia</button></strong>, the loss of accommodative power in the lens, interferes with the ability to adequately focus and is the factor responsible for most older adults requiring some form of corrective lenses (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Age-related changes in the eye are summarized in <a href="#tt58-1">Table 58-1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Impaired vision is often accompanied by difficulty in performing functional activities. People with visual acuity of 20/80 to 20/100 with a visual field restriction of 60 degrees to greater than 20 degrees can read at a nearly normal level with optical aids. Their visual orientation is near normal but requires increased scanning of the environment (i.e., systematic use of head and eye movements). In a visual acuity range of 20/200 to 20/400 with a 20-degree to greater than 10-degree visual field restriction, the person can read slowly with optical aids.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common causes of blindness and visual impairment among adults 40 years and older are diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4177">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). Macular degeneration is more prevalent among Caucasians, whereas glaucoma is more prevalent among African Americans (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2742">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Managing vision impairment involves magnification and image enhancement through the use of low-vision aids and strategies, as well as referrals to social services and community agencies. The goals are to optimize the patient&#x2019;s remaining vision and assist the patient to perform customary activities. <a href="#tt58-2">Table 58-2</a> presents low-vision aids. Medications are prescribed for glaucoma. Ongoing research suggests that gene therapy may replace or be an adjunct to pharmacologic or surgical treatment for ocular disorders in the near future (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Jolly, Bridge, &#x0026; MacLaren, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct58-3"><strong>Chart 58-3 <img class="m" src="images/icon20watch.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Should Preservation of Patient Autonomy Threaten the Welfare of Others?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You work as a staff nurse on a subacute care unit. D.P. is an 85-year-old man who has made daily visits to see his wife who has been a patient on the unit for the past week for daily physical and occupational therapy after having hip surgery. During your morning rounds today, D.P.&#x2019;s wife tells you that her husband did not visit her yesterday and she is worried about him. After lunch, D.P. arrives on the subacute care unit with a sheepish grin on his face and a bandage on his forehead. When D.P.&#x2019;s wife tells him that she was worried about him, he replies &#x201C;Do not worry about me! I got into a fender bender yesterday but I am okay.&#x201D; D.P.&#x2019;s wife shakes her head and says &#x201C;Why are you so stubborn? You cannot see well at all anymore and should not be driving!&#x201D; With tears in his eyes, D.P. says to his wife &#x201C;But how else would I get here to see you, my sweetheart? Nothing could ever keep me away from you!&#x201D; Based on previous conversations you have had with D.P. and his wife, you know that they live alone together in a two-bedroom ranch home that they have shared for the past 60 years. They have two adult sons who both live several hundred miles away.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In American society, being able to drive is seen as consistent with being able to maintain an independent lifestyle. It is not uncommon for older adults to feel threatened by a possible loss of driving rights. D.P.&#x2019;s apparent devotion to his wife and inability to identify an acceptable alternative means to visit her seems to be compounding his feelings of vulnerability.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">There are some states that require health care providers to report drivers whom they think are impaired and unsafe. As a witness to this verbal exchange between D.P. and his wife, you may be obligated to investigate this situation further, or be liable for civil or criminal penalties.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Is it possible to preserve D.P.&#x2019;s autonomy while ensuring that neither D.P. nor others are harmed should he continue to drive?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Regardless of the legal requirements in your state, what are your ethical and moral obligations to D.P., his wife, and to others who may be impacted by D.P.&#x2019;s driving?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might you mobilize to be of assistance to you, to D.P., and to D.P.&#x2019;s wife? It is not uncommon for spouses to neglect their own health needs when their partner becomes ill. You may wish to explore whether D.P. has had a recent focused visual examination, to find whether he has visual deficits amenable to correction. In addition, although D.P.&#x2019;s children do not live close, D.P. and his wife may have other social support networks that they could tap into to assist them so that D.P. can continue his daily visits with his wife. Local Area Agencies on Aging can also provide a wealth of contacts and support services for older adults that could be explored.</p>

<p class="indent">Referrals to community agencies may be necessary for patients with low vision who live alone and cannot self-administer their medications. Community agencies, such as the Lighthouse Guild, offer a wide variety of vision and health care services to patients with low vision and blindness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2743">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses need to be sensitive to the challenges faced by patients with visual impairments. Coping with blindness involves emotional, physical, and social adaptation. The emotional adjustment to blindness or severe visual impairment determines the success of the physical and social adjustments of the patient. Successful emotional adjustment means acceptance of blindness or severe visual impairment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Coping</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Effective coping may not occur until the patient recognizes the permanence of the low vision or blindness. A patient who is newly visually impaired and their family members undergo the various steps of grieving: denial and shock, anger and protest, restitution, loss resolution, and acceptance. The ability to accept the changes that must come with visual loss and willingness to adapt to those changes influence the successful rehabilitation of the patient with vision loss. Additional aspects to consider are value changes, independence&#x2013;dependence conflicts, coping with stigma, and learning to function in social settings without visual cues and landmarks.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Spatial Orientation and Mobility</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A person who is blind or severely visually impaired requires strategies for adapting to the environment. ADLs, such as walking to a chair from a bed, require spatial concepts. The person needs to know where they are in relation to the rest of the room, to understand the changes that may occur, and to know how to approach the desired location safely. This requires a collaborative effort between the patient and the responsible adult who serves as the sighted guide. The nurse must assess the degree of physical assistance the person with vision loss requires and communicate this to other health care personnel.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should be aware of the importance of techniques in providing physical assistance, encouraging independence, and ensuring safety. Strategies for interacting with the patient with vision loss are presented in <a href="#ct58-4">Chart 58-4</a>. Research supports the use of a validated protocol to educate staff to perform therapeutic communication, deliver services, and minimize communication barriers with patients who are blind (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4191">Pagliuca, Mac&#x00EA;do-Costa, Rebou&#x00E7;as, et al., 2014</a>). The readiness of the patient and family to learn must be assessed before initiating orientation and mobility training.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse, social worker, family, and others collaborate to assess the patient&#x2019;s home condition and support system. A low vision specialist or occupational therapist should be consulted, particularly for patients for whom identifying and administering medications pose challenges. Referral for vision rehabilitation should be provided for appropriate patients (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4196">Shah, Schwartz, Gartner, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Strategies for Interacting with People Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Remember that the only difference between you and people who are blind or have low vision is that they are not able to see through their eyes what you are able to see through yours.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not be uncomfortable when in the company of a person who is blind or has low vision. Talk with the person as you would talk with any other person, honestly and with respect, courtesy, and empathy; do not be concerned about using words like &#x201C;see&#x201D; and &#x201C;look.&#x201D; There is no need to raise your voice unless the person asks you to do so.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify yourself as you approach the person and before you make physical contact. Tell the person your name and your role. If another person approaches, introduce them. When you leave the room, be sure to tell the person that you are leaving and if anyone else remains in the room.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep in mind that it is often appropriate to touch the person&#x2019;s hand or arm lightly to indicate that you are about to speak.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When talking, face the person and speak directly to them using a normal tone of voice.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be specific when communicating direction. Mention a specific distance or use clock cues when possible (e.g., walk left about 2 yards; walk about 20 feet to the right; the telephone is at 2 o&#x2019;clock). Avoid using phrases such as &#x201C;over there.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When you offer to assist someone, allow the person to hold on to your arm just above the elbow and to walk a half step behind you.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When offering the person a seat, place the person&#x2019;s hand on the back or the arm of the seat.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When you are about to go up or down a flight of stairs, tell the person and place their hand on the banister.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Make sure that the environment is free of obstacles; close doors and cabinets so that they are not in the path.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Offer to read written information, such as a menu.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you serve food to the person, use clock cues to specify where everything is on the plate.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When the person who is blind or has low vision is a patient in a health care facility:</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle_a"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Make sure all objects the person will need are close at hand.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle_a"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the location of objects that the person may need (e.g., &#x201C;The call light is near your right hand&#x201D;; &#x201C;The telephone is on the table on the left side of your bed.&#x201D;)</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle_a"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Remove obstacles that may be in the person&#x2019;s pathway and could cause a fall.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle_a"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Place all assistive devices that the person uses close at hand; let the person feel the devices so that they know their location.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not distract a service animal unless the owner has given permission.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ask the person, &#x201C;How can I help you?&#x201D; At some times, the person needs help; at other times, help may not be needed.</p>

<p class="indent">Other interventions that are appropriate for some people with visual impairment or blindness include Braille and service animals. There has been an ever-increasing reliance on print magnification technology as well as technology-assisted speech output. However, although the use of Braille may be less important for adults who have already learned language and grammar skills, educators and low vision specialists have continued to advocate that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn Braille.</p>
<p class="indent">Guide dogs, also known as service dogs, are dogs that are specially bred, raised, and rigorously trained to assist people who are blind. The guide dog is a constant companion to the person who is blind (also referred to as the animal&#x2019;s handler) and is allowed on airplanes and in restaurants, stores, hotels, and other public places. With the assistance of the guide dog, the person who is blind can be extremely mobile and accomplish normal activities both within and outside of the home and workplace. A dog in harness is a working dog, not a pet. The dog should not be distracted from his job by well-intentioned strangers who want to pet, feed, or play with the animal. The dog&#x2019;s handler should always be consulted before approaching the working guide dog. Most health care facilities have a service animal policy that outlines the responsibilities of the handler with regard to the care of the animal.</p>

<p class="CASEMSTUDYptype03pPARApnonIndent">Recall from <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> <span class="bl">Vernon Watkins,</span> who came to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and underwent a hemicolectomy for a bowel perforation. During postoperative care the nurse determines that he has poor vision. What measures can the nurse take to maintain a safe environment for a patient with visual impairment? How will the discovery of impaired vision impact the nursing plan of care, discharge planning, and delivery of patient education?</p>
