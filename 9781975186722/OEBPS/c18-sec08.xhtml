<h4 class="h4" id="s586">Laryngitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;laryngitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the larynx; may be caused by voice abuse, exposure to irritants, or infectious organisms">Laryngitis</button></strong>, an inflammation of the larynx, can occur as a result of voice abuse, exposure to dust, chemicals, smoke and other pollutants; or as part of a URI. It also may be caused by isolated infection involving only the vocal cords. Laryngitis can also be associated with gastroesophageal reflux (referred to as reflux laryngitis).</p>
<p class="indent">Laryngitis is very often caused by the pathogens that cause the common cold and pharyngitis; the most common cause is a virus, and laryngitis is often associated with allergic rhinitis or pharyngitis. Bacterial invasion may be secondary. The onset of infection may be associated with exposure to sudden temperature changes, dietary deficiencies, malnutrition, or an immunosuppressed state. Viral laryngitis is common in the winter and is easily transmitted to others.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s587">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Signs of acute laryngitis include hoarseness or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aphonia:&lt;/b&gt; impaired ability to use one&#x2019;s voice due to disease or injury to the larynx">aphonia</button></strong> (loss of voice) and severe cough. Chronic laryngitis is marked by persistent hoarseness. Other signs of acute laryngitis include sudden onset made worse by cold dry wind. The throat feels worse in the morning and improves when the patient is indoors in a warmer climate. At times, the patient presents with a dry cough and a dry, sore throat that worsens in the evening hours. If allergies are present, the uvula will be visibly edematous. Many patients also complain of a &#x201C;tickle&#x201D; in the throat that is made worse by cold air or cold liquids.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s588">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of acute laryngitis includes resting the voice, avoiding irritants (including smoking), resting, and inhaling cool steam or an aerosol. If the laryngitis is part of a more extensive respiratory infection caused by a bacterial organism or if it is severe, appropriate antibacterial therapy is instituted. The majority of patients recover with conservative treatment; however, laryngitis tends to be more severe in older adult patients and may be complicated by pneumonia.</p>
<p class="indent">For chronic laryngitis, the treatment includes resting the voice, eliminating any primary respiratory tract infection, eliminating smoking, and avoiding secondhand smoke. Corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone, may be given. These preparations have few systemic or long-lasting effects and may reduce local inflammatory reactions. Treatment of reflux laryngitis typically involves use of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole given once daily.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s589">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse instructs the patient to rest the voice and to maintain a well-humidified environment. If laryngeal secretions are present during acute episodes, expectorant agents are suggested, along with a daily fluid intake of 2 to 3 L to thin secretions. The nurse instructs the patient about the importance of taking prescribed medications, including proton pump inhibitors, and using continuous positive airway therapy at bedtime, if prescribed for OSA. In cases involving infection, the nurse informs the patient that the symptoms of laryngitis often extend a week to 10 days after completion of antibiotic therapy. The nurse instructs the patient about signs and symptoms that require contacting the primary provider. These signs and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page508" title="508"></span>symptoms include loss of voice with sore throat that makes swallowing saliva difficult, hemoptysis, and noisy respirations. Continued hoarseness after voice rest or laryngitis that persists for longer than 5 days must be reported because of the possibility of malignancy.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A health history may reveal signs and symptoms of headache, sore throat, pain around the eyes and on either side of the nose, difficulty in swallowing, cough, hoarseness, fever, stuffiness, and generalized discomfort and fatigue. Determining when the symptoms began, what precipitated them, what if anything relieves them, and what aggravates them is part of the assessment. The nurse should also determine any history of allergy or the existence of a concomitant illness. Inspection may reveal swelling, lesions, or asymmetry of the nose as well as bleeding or discharge. The nurse inspects the nasal mucosa for abnormal findings such as increased redness, swelling, exudate, and nasal polyps, which may develop in chronic rhinitis. The mucosa of the nasal turbinates may also be swollen (boggy) and pale bluish-gray. The nurse palpates the frontal and maxillary sinuses for tenderness, which suggests inflammation and then inspects the throat by having the patient open the mouth wide and take a deep breath. Redness, asymmetry, or evidence of drainage, ulceration, or enlargement of the tonsils and pharynx is abnormal. Palpation of the neck lymph nodes for enlargement and tenderness is necessary.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired airway clearance associated with excessive mucus production secondary to retained secretions and inflammation</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with upper airway irritation secondary to an infection</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired verbal communication associated with physiologic changes and upper airway irritation secondary to infection or swelling</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hypovolaemia associated with decreased fluid intake and increased fluid loss secondary to diaphoresis associated with a fever</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge regarding prevention of URIs, treatment regimen, surgical procedure, or postoperative self-care</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, potential complications include:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sepsis</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Meningitis or brain abscess</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, or rhinosinusitis</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of a patent airway, relief of pain, maintenance of effective means of communication, normal hydration, knowledge of how to prevent upper airway infections, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING A</small> P<small>ATENT</small> A<small>IRWAY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">An accumulation of secretions can block the airway in patients with an upper airway infection. As a result, changes in the respiratory pattern occur and the work of breathing increases to compensate for the blockage. The nurse can implement several measures to loosen thick secretions or to keep the secretions moist so that they can be easily expectorated. Increasing fluid intake helps thin the mucus. The use of room vaporizers or steam inhalation also loosens secretions and reduces inflammation of the mucous membranes. To enhance drainage from the sinuses, the nurse instructs the patient about positioning; this depends on the location of the infection or inflammation. For example, drainage for rhinosinusitis or rhinitis is achieved in the upright position. In some conditions, topical or systemic medications, when prescribed, help relieve nasal or throat congestion.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> C<small>OMFORT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">URIs usually produce localized discomfort. In rhinosinusitis, pain may occur in the area of the sinuses, or a general headache may be produced. In pharyngitis, laryngitis, or tonsillitis, a sore throat occurs. The nurse encourages the patient to take antispasmodic agents, such as acetaminophen with codeine, as prescribed, to relieve this discomfort. A pain intensity rating scale (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) may be used to assess effectiveness of pain relief measures. Other helpful measures include topical anesthetic agents for symptomatic relief of herpes simplex blisters (see <a href="c18-sec03.xhtml#ct18-3">Chart&#x00A0;18-3</a>) and sore throats, hot packs to relieve the congestion of rhinosinusitis and promote drainage, and warm water gargles or irrigations to relieve the pain of a sore throat. The nurse encourages rest to relieve the generalized discomfort and fever that accompany many upper airway conditions (especially rhinitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis). For postoperative care after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, an ice collar may reduce swelling and decrease bleeding.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> C<small>OMMUNICATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Upper airway infections may result in hoarseness or loss of speech. The nurse instructs the patient to refrain from speaking as much as possible and, if possible, to communicate in writing instead. Additional strain on the vocal cords may delay full return of the voice. The nurse encourages the patient and family to use alternative forms of communication, such as a memo pad, bell, or a smartphone or other electronic devices to signal for assistance.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NCOURAGING</small> F<small>LUID</small> I<small>NTAKE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Upper airway infections lead to fluid loss. Sore throat, malaise, and fever may interfere with a patient&#x2019;s willingness to eat and drink. The nurse provides a list of easily ingested foods to increase caloric intake during the acute phase of illness. These include soups, gelatin, pudding, yogurt, cottage cheese, high-protein drinks, water, ice, and ice pops. The nurse encourages the patient to drink 2 to 3 L of fluid per day during the acute stage of airway infection, unless contraindicated, to thin the secretions and promote drainage. Liquids (hot or cold) may be soothing, depending on the disorder.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Prevention of most upper airway infections is challenging because of the many potential causes. But because most URIs are transmitted by hand-to-hand contact, the nurse educates the patient and family about techniques to minimize the spread of infection to others, including implementing hand hygiene measures. The nurse advises the patient to avoid exposure to people who are at the risk for serious illness if respiratory infection is transmitted (older adults, people who are immunosuppressed, and those with chronic health problems).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse instructs patients and their families about strategies to relieve symptoms of URIs and reinforces the need to complete the treatment regimen, particularly when antibiotics are prescribed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Referral for home, community-based, or transitional care is rare. However, it may be indicated for people whose health status was compromised before the onset of the respiratory infection and for those who cannot manage self-care without assistance. In such circumstances, the home health nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status and progress in recovery. The nurse may advise older adult patients and those at increased risk from a respiratory infection to consider annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. A follow-up appointment with the primary provider may be indicated for patients with compromised health status to ensure that the respiratory infection has resolved.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Although major complications of URIs are rare, the nurse must be aware of them and assess the patient for them. Because most patients with URIs are managed at home, patients and their families must be instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms and to seek immediate medical care if the patient&#x2019;s condition does not improve or if the patient&#x2019;s physical status appears to be worsening.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Sepsis or meningitis may occur in patients with compromised immune status or in those with an acute bacterial infection. The patient and caregiver are instructed to seek medical care if the patient&#x2019;s condition fails to improve within several days after the onset of symptoms, if unusual symptoms develop, or if the patient&#x2019;s condition deteriorates. They are instructed about signs and symptoms that require further attention: persistent or high fever, increasing shortness of breath, confusion, and increasing weakness and malaise. The patient with sepsis requires expert care to treat the infection, stabilize vital signs, and prevent or treat septic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Deterioration of the patient&#x2019;s condition necessitates intensive care measures (e.g., hemodynamic monitoring and administration of vasoactive medications, IV fluids, nutritional support, and corticosteroids) to monitor the patient&#x2019;s status and to support the patient&#x2019;s vital signs. High doses of antibiotics may be given to treat the causative organism. The nurse&#x2019;s role is to monitor the patient&#x2019;s vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values; administer needed treatment; alleviate the patient&#x2019;s physical discomfort; and provide explanations, education, and emotional support to the patient and family.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Peritonsillar abscess may develop after an acute infection of the tonsils. The patient requires treatment to drain the abscess and receives antibiotics for infection and topical anesthetic agents and throat irrigations to relieve pain and sore throat. Follow-up is necessary to ensure that the abscess resolves; tonsillectomy may be required. The nurse assists the patient in administering throat irrigations and instructs the patient and family about the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment regimen and recommended follow-up appointments.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In some severe situations, peritonsillar abscess may progress to meningitis or brain abscess. The nurse assesses for changes in mental status ranging from subtle personality changes through drowsiness to coma, nuchal rigidity, and focal neurologic signs that signal increasing cerebral edema around the abscess (see <a href="c64.xhtml">Chapter 64</a>). Seizures, typically tonic&#x2013;clonic, occur in this setting. Intensive care measures are necessary. High doses of antibiotics may be used to treat the causative organism. The nurse&#x2019;s role is similar to caring for the patient with sepsis in an intensive care setting. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s neurologic status and reports changes immediately.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Otitis media and rhinosinusitis may develop with URI. The patient and family are instructed about the signs and symptoms of otitis media and rhinosinusitis and about the importance of follow-up with the primary provider to ensure adequate evaluation and treatment of these conditions.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
