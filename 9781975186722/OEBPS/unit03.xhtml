<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps3">A</span> 32-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain. She is diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and is scheduled for a laparoscopic procedure to remove her gallbladder. After completing the preoperative procedures and preprocedure verification, the patient is brought to the operating room (OR) where you work. The surgical safety checklist involves members of the team including the surgeon, anesthesia provider, circulating nurse, and OR technician. Prior to induction of anesthesia the team confirms the patient&#x2019;s identity, procedure, and consent. In addition, the incision site is marked, the anesthesia machine and medication check is completed, and the pulse oximeter is placed on the patient and is confirmed to be working. The team also checks if the patient has a known allergy, if there are any airway or aspiration risks, and whether there is risk of a &#x003E;500 mL blood loss.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
