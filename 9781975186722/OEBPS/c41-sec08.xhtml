<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diverticulum:&lt;/b&gt; saclike out-pouching of the lining of the bowel protruding through the muscle of the intestinal wall">diverticulum</button></strong> is a saclike herniation of the lining of the bowel that extends through a defect in the muscle layer. True diverticula are herniations of all layers of the GI wall (mucosa, muscularis propria, and adventitia), while pseudo-diverticula only involve the mucosa and submucosa (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>). Diverticula may occur anywhere in the GI tract, from the esophagus to the colon, but occur most commonly in the colon. In the colon there is only one complete muscle layer, in contrast to the small intestine and rectum which have two muscular layers. People with Asian ancestry are more likely to develop diverticula in the right colon, while people of European descent are more prone to diverticular disease in the sigmoid colon (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diverticulosis:&lt;/b&gt; presence of several diverticula in the intestine">Diverticulosis</button></strong> is defined by the presence of multiple diverticula without inflammation or symptoms. Diverticular disease of the colon is very common in developed countries, and its prevalence increases with increasing age; it is present in half of all adults over 65 years of age, and 70% of adults over 80 years of age (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Krzyzak &#x0026; Mulrooney, 2019</a>). Diverticulosis is the most common pathologic incidental finding on colonoscopy. Approximately 80% of patients with diverticulosis never develop any complications or symptoms of disease. Risk factors include low intake of dietary fiber, slow colonic transit time, obesity, a history of cigarette smoking, regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and a positive family history. Dietary factors such as high intake of red meat, fat, particularly dairy fat, and refined sugar are strongly associated with diverticular disease (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Krzyzak &#x0026; Mulrooney, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diverticulitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of a diverticulum from obstruction by fecal matter resulting in abscess formation">Diverticulitis</button></strong> is inflammation of one or more diverticula and is a common reason for elective colectomy (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>). Approximately 1% to 4% of people with diverticulosis develop diverticulitis; of those, 20% will have another episode within 10 years (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1727">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diverticula form when the mucosal and submucosal layers of the colon herniate through the muscular wall because of high intraluminal pressure, low volume in the colon (i.e., fiber-deficient contents), and decreased muscle strength in the colon wall (i.e., muscular hypertrophy from hardened fecal masses). The etiology of diverticulitis is not completely understood. One theory is the cause due to an altered immune response in the gut microbiome (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Krzyzak &#x0026; Mulrooney, 2019</a>). Other explanations are feces or food particles become trapped in diverticula, resulting in bacterial overgrowth, distention, increased intraluminal pressure, muscle spasms, vascular compromise, and subsequent micro- or macroperforation. Complications <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1301" title="1301"></span>include intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fistula:&lt;/b&gt; anatomically abnormal tract that arises between two internal organs or between an internal organ and the body surface">fistula</button></strong> (abnormal tract formation), and hemorrhage (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Krzyzak &#x0026; Mulrooney, 2019</a>). Repeated bouts of diverticulitis can result in scar tissue formation, which may lead to narrowing of the colonic lumen and bowel obstruction.</p>
<p class="indent">Bowel contents can accumulate in a diverticulum and decompose, causing inflammation and infection. The diverticulum can also become obstructed and then inflamed if the obstruction continues. The inflammation of the weakened colonic wall of the diverticulum can cause it to perforate, giving rise to irritability and spasticity of the colon (i.e., diverticulitis). In addition, abscesses may develop and may eventually perforate, leading to peritonitis and erosion of the arterial blood vessels, resulting in bleeding. When a patient develops symptoms of diverticulitis, microperforation of the colon has occurred.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1728">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic constipation sometimes precedes the development of diverticulosis by many years. Most commonly, no problematic symptoms occur with diverticulosis. Some patients may have mild signs and symptoms that include bowel irregularity with intervals of alternating constipation and diarrhea, with nausea, anorexia, and bloating or abdominal distention.</p>
<p class="indent">With diverticulitis, up to 70% of patients report an acute onset of mild to severe cramping pain in the left lower quadrant (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>). This may be accompanied by a change in bowel habits, most typically constipation or obstipation (i.e., severe constipation) and bloating, with nausea, fever, and leukocytosis. Acute complications of diverticulitis may include abscess formation, bleeding, and peritonitis. If an abscess develops, the associated findings are tenderness, a palpable mass, fever, and leukocytosis. Inflamed diverticula may erode areas adjacent to arterial branches, causing massive rectal bleeding. An inflamed diverticulum that perforates results in abdominal pain localized over the involved segment, usually the sigmoid; local abscess or peritonitis follows (see previous discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Recurrent episodes of diverticulitis may cause chronic complications that include fistula formation, including colovesicular fistulas (i.e., between the colon and bladder) and, in women, colovaginal fistulas (i.e., between the colon and vagina). As a response to repeated inflammation, the colon may narrow with scar tissue and fibrotic strictures, leading to cramps, narrow stools, and increased constipation, or, at times, intestinal obstruction (see later discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1729">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diverticulosis is typically diagnosed by colonoscopy, which permits visualization of the extent of diverticular disease. Laboratory tests that assist in diagnosis of diverticulitis include a CBC; if the patient has frank blood in the stool, the hemoglobin level should be analyzed. The WBC is frequently elevated; however, a normal WBC count does not rule out diverticulitis. Up to 40% of patients with diverticulitis have a normal WBC count (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>). Urinalysis and urine cultures should be analyzed in patients with suspected colovesicular fistulas.</p>
<p class="indent">An abdominal CT scan with contrast agent is the diagnostic test of choice to confirm diverticulitis; it can also reveal perforation and abscesses. Abdominal x-rays may demonstrate free air under the diaphragm if a perforation has occurred from the diverticulitis. Results from these radiologic tests confirm whether or not the patient has uncomplicated diverticulitis or complicated diverticulitis that could require surgical intervention. The Modified Hinchey Classification System is used as a guide to determine treatment (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3062">Hinchey, Schaal, &#x0026; Richards, 1978</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Krzyzak &#x0026; Mulrooney, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#tt41-3">Table 41-3</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1730"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of diverticular disease increases with age because of degeneration and structural changes in the circular muscle layers of the colon and because of cellular hypertrophy. The symptoms are less pronounced in the older adult than in other adults. Older adults may not have abdominal pain until infection occurs. They may delay reporting symptoms because they fear surgery or are afraid that they may have cancer (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1731">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management is guided by the severity of disease and the presence of comorbid diagnoses and complications. Treatment for patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis is on an outpatient basis with diet and medication. This is the typical treatment for most patients with diagnosed diverticulitis. Rest, oral fluids, and analgesic medications are recommended. Initially, a clear liquid diet is consumed until the inflammation subsides; then a high-fiber, low-fat diet is recommended. This type of diet helps increase stool volume, decrease colonic transit time, and reduce intraluminal pressure. The American Gastroenterology Association recommends selective use of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1302" title="1302"></span>antibiotics for patients with acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghoulam, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In acute cases of diverticulitis with significant symptoms, hospitalization is required. Hospitalization is often indicated for those who are older, immunocompromised, taking corticosteroids, or unable to tolerate oral fluids. Patients with complicated disease (see <a href="#tt41-3">Table 41-3</a>) can require hospitalization; those with higher stages require surgery and hospitalization (see later discussion). Withholding oral intake, administering IV fluids, and instituting nasogastric (NG) suctioning if vomiting or distention occurs are used to rest the bowel. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate) are prescribed. An opioid or other analgesic agent may be prescribed for pain relief. Oral intake is increased as symptoms subside. A low-fiber diet may be necessary until signs of infection decrease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although acute diverticulitis usually subsides with medical management, immediate surgical intervention is necessary if complications (e.g., perforation, peritonitis, hemorrhage, obstruction) occur. In cases of abscess formation without peritonitis, hemorrhage, or obstruction, CT-guided percutaneous drainage may be performed to drain the abscess, and IV antibiotics are given. After the abscess is drained and the acute episode of inflammation has subsided (after approximately 6 weeks), surgery may be recommended to prevent repeated episodes. Two types of surgery are typically considered either to treat acute complications or prevent further episodes of inflammation:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>One-stage resection, in which the inflamed area is removed and a primary end-to-end anastomosis is completed</span></li>
<li><span>Multiple-stage procedures for complications such as obstruction or perforation (see <a href="#ff41-4">Fig. 41-4</a>)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The type of surgery performed depends on the extent of complications found during the procedure. When possible, the area of diverticulitis is resected and the remaining bowel is joined end to end (i.e., primary resection and end-to-end anastomosis). This is performed using traditional surgical or laparoscopically assisted colectomy with lavage. A two-stage resection may be performed in patients with Hinchey Stage IV diverticulitis; the diseased colon is resected (as in a one-stage procedure) but no anastomosis is performed. In this procedure, one end of the bowel is brought out to the abdominal wall and the distal end is closed over and left in the abdomen (Hartmann procedure), or if the blood supply to the distal colon is questionable, both ends of the bowel are brought out to the abdominal wall (double-barrel). Both Hartmann procedures and double-barrel colostomies usually can be reanastomosed at a later time.</p>

The affected segment (<em>clamp attached</em>) has been divided at its distal end. In a primary anastomosis, the proximal margin (<em>dotted line</em>) is transected and the bowel attached end to end. In a two-stage procedure, a colostomy is constructed at the proximal margin with the distal stump oversewn (Hartmann procedure, as shown) and the stump is left in the pelvis. The distal stump may be brought to the surface as a mucous fistula if there is concern about blood supply. The second stage consists of colostomy takedown and anastomosis.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

<p class="nonindent">The nurse recommends a fluid intake of 2 L/day (within limits of the patient&#x2019;s cardiac and renal reserve) and suggests foods that are soft but have increased fiber, such as prepared cereals or soft-cooked vegetables, to increase the bulk of the stool and facilitate peristalsis, thereby promoting defecation. An individualized exercise program is encouraged to improve abdominal muscle tone. It is important to review the patient&#x2019;s daily routine to establish a schedule for meals and a set time for defecation and to assist in identifying habits that may have suppressed the urge to defecate. The nurse encourages daily intake of bulk laxatives such as psyllium, which helps propel feces through the colon. Some people with diverticulosis may have food triggers such as nuts and popcorn that bring on a diverticulitis attack, whereas others may not report food triggers. If triggers are identified, patients should be urged to avoid them.</p>
