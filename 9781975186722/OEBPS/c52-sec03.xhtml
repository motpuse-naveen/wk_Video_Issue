<h4 class="h4" id="s2428">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in patients with breast conditions. The nurse should educate the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse should note trends in the patient&#x2019;s test results, because they often provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2429">Breast Self-Examination</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse plays a critical role in breast awareness education&#x2014;a modality used for the early detection of breast cancer. BSE can be taught in a variety of settings, either on a one-to-one basis or in a group. It can also be initiated by a health care provider during a patient&#x2019;s routine physical examination. Regular self-examinations may result in early identification of problems and may also result in more diagnostic workups for benign or malignant problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Variations in breast tissue occur during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and the onset of menopause. Women on HT can also experience fluctuations. Normal changes must be distinguished from those that may signal disease. Most women notice increased tenderness and lumpiness before their menstrual periods; therefore, BSE is best performed after menses (day 5 to day 7, counting the first day of menses as day 1). In addition, many women have grainy-textured breast tissue, but such areas are usually less nodular after menses. Younger women may find BSE particularly difficult because of the density of their breast tissue. As women age, their breasts become fattier and may be easier to examine.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1712</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1713" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1713">p. 1713</span></div>
<p class="indent">Current practice is shifting from educating about BSE to promoting breast self-awareness, which is a woman&#x2019;s attentiveness to the normal appearance and feel of her breasts. However, self-examination still may be appropriate for some women who are at high risk and for those who prefer it. Breast self-awareness can include self-examination. For every woman, knowing how her breasts normally feel helps detect any changes or signs of a problem. BSE may play an important role in screening, especially for women who develop cancer in the interval after a negative result on mammography or clinical breast examination or who have a false-negative imaging or clinical examination result. It can also promote detection in women who have not been screened. The goal, with or without BSE, is to report any breast changes to a primary provider.</p>
<p class="indent">Family history can increase the risk of breast cancer in men, particularly if other men in the family have had breast cancer. The risk is also higher if there is a breast cancer gene abnormality in the family. <em>BRCA2</em> mutations are much more common than <em>BRCA1</em> mutations in males (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Jain &#x0026; Gradishar, 2018</a>). Instructions about BSE should be provided to men if they have a family history of breast cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who elect to perform BSE should receive proper instruction on technique (see <a href="#ct52-2">Chart&#x00A0;52-2</a>). They should be informed that routine, monthly BSE will help them become familiar with their &#x201C;normal abnormalities.&#x201D; If a change is detected, they should seek medical attention.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients should be instructed about optimal timing for BSE (5 to 7 days after menses begin for women who are premenopausal and once monthly for women who are postmenopausal or not menstruating). When demonstrating examination techniques, the feel of normal breast tissue should be reviewed and ways to identify breast changes discussed. Patients should then perform a BSE demonstration on themselves or on a breast model. Patients who have had breast cancer surgery should be instructed to examine their breast or chest wall for any new changes or nodules that may indicate a recurrence of the disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2430">Mammography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The ACS has changed the mammography recommendations to state that healthy women should have mammography every year beginning at age 45; women aged 40 to 44 have the option to begin yearly screening early (ACS, 2019). Women 55 and older may continue yearly screening or transition to every 2 years. This change was based on calculations that starting annual screening mammography later and getting it less often would cause less harm and be as safe as starting it earlier and getting it more often. Screening every other year may, however, result in a missed diagnosis and a small increase in the probability of being diagnosed with later-stage cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Mammography is a breast imaging technique using a low-dose x-ray system to visualize the anatomy of the breasts; this aids in the early detection and diagnosis of malignant or benign disease (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3780">American College of Radiology [ACR], 2019</a>). The procedure takes about 30 minutes and can be performed in a hospital radiology department or independent imaging center. Two views are taken of each breast. The breast is mechanically compressed from top to bottom (craniocaudal view) (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-4">Fig.&#x00A0;52-4</a></span>) and side to side (mediolateral oblique view). Women may experience some discomfort because maximum compression is necessary for proper visualization. The new mammogram is compared with previous mammograms, and any changes may indicate a need for further investigation. Mammography may detect a breast tumor before it is clinically palpable. Younger women, or those taking HTs, may have dense breast tissue, making it more difficult to detect lesions with mammography.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients scheduled for a mammogram may voice concern about exposure to radiation. The radiation exposure is equivalent to about 7 weeks of natural background radiation exposure (ACR, 2019), so patients would have to have many mammograms in a year to increase their cancer risk. To ensure that a mammogram is reliable, it is important that a woman find a reputable facility. Mammographic facilities are certified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the machines are accredited by either the American College of Radiology or the States of Arkansas, Iowa or Texas (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Additional techniques for breast screening include digital mammography and 3D mammography. Digital mammography records x-ray images on a computer instead of on film, thus allowing radiologists to adjust the contrast and focus on an image without having to take additional x-rays. Although the accuracy of both film and digital screening mammography is similar for most women, digital mammography has been shown to be better at detecting estrogen receptor&#x2013;negative tumors and cancer in extremely dense breasts. Both of these subgroups are more common in younger women, who may therefore choose digital mammography if they wish to have screening mammography. The 3D mammography obtains multiple projections of the compressed breast and results in lower false-positive interpretation rates and improved cancer detection rates (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Bassett &#x0026; Lee-Felker, 2018</a>). Computer-aided detection (CAD) is an option for radiologists and can be helpful in finding abnormal areas that should be checked more closely for early cancers. Refinements and improvements have been made to CAD software with a focus on increasing sensitivity for masses and reducing false-positive rates.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2431">Contrast Mammography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A contrast mammography (i.e., ductogram, galactogram) is a diagnostic procedure that involves injection of less than 1 mL of radiopaque material through a cannula inserted into a ductal opening on the areola, which is followed by a mammogram (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Bassett &#x0026; Lee-Felker, 2018</a>). It is performed to evaluate an abnormality within the duct when the patient has bloody nipple discharge on expression, spontaneous nipple discharge, or a solitary dilated duct noted on mammography.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2432">Ultrasonography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ultrasonography (ultrasound) is used as a diagnostic adjunct to mammography to help distinguish fluid-filled cysts from other lesions. A thin coating of lubricating jelly is spread over the area to be imaged. A transducer is then placed on the breast. The transducer transmits high-frequency sound waves through the skin toward the area of concern. The sound waves are reflected back from a two-dimensional image, which is then displayed on a computer screen. No radiation is emitted during the procedure. Ultrasound is also used as an adjunct to mammography in women with dense breast tissue. Ultrasound may be used as an aid for interventional procedures.</p>

<p class="indent">Ultrasonography has advantages and disadvantages. Although it can diagnose cysts with great accuracy, it cannot definitively rule out malignant lesions. Microcalcifications, which are detectable on mammography, cannot be identified on ultrasonography. Finally, examination techniques and interpretation criteria are not standardized.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2433">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is a highly sensitive test that has become a useful diagnostic adjunct to mammography. A magnet is linked to a computer that creates detailed images of the breast without exposure to radiation. An intravenous (IV) injection of gadolinium, a contrast dye, is given to improve visibility. The patient lies face down, and the breast is placed through a depression in the table. A coil is placed around the breast, and the patient is placed inside the MRI machine. The entire procedure takes about 30 to 40&#x00A0;minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Breast MRI is useful for evaluation of contralateral disease, invasive lobular carcinoma, and assessment of chemotherapeutic response. Additionally, screening guidelines provided by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend an annual MRI scan in addition to mammography in women at high risk for breast cancer (i.e., those with greater than 20% lifetime risk). Candidates include women who have a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation, a first-degree relative with either of these mutations, certain rare genetic syndromes, or radiation to the chest between 10 and 30 years of age (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3801">National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2019</a>). MRI should be used in addition to mammography, not instead of it.</p>
<p class="indent">Some disadvantages of MRI include high cost, variations in technique and interpretation, and the potential for patient claustrophobia. The procedure cannot always accurately distinguish between malignant and benign breast conditions, so false-positive results may occur. MRI is contraindicated in patients with implantable metal devices (e.g., aneurysm clips, ports of tissue expanders). Patients with any type of cardiac implantable electronic device need to be screened to see if it is safe for them to undergo an MRI (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3789">Indik, Gimbel, Abe, et al., 2017</a>). Foil-backed medication patches (e.g., nicotine, nitroglycerin, fentanyl) must be removed prior to MRI to avoid burns to the skin.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2434">Procedures for Tissue Analysis</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Percutaneous Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Percutaneous biopsy is performed on an outpatient basis to sample palpable and nonpalpable lesions. Less invasive than a surgical biopsy, percutaneous biopsy is a needle or core biopsy that obtains tissue by making a small puncture in the skin. <span class="chart"><a href="#tt52-1">Table&#x00A0;52-1</a></span> outlines the different types of biopsies that can be performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis.</p>

<p class="h7">Fine-Needle Aspiration</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)</strong> is a biopsy technique that is generally well tolerated by most women. A local anesthetic may or may not be used. A small-gauge needle (20- to 27-gauge) attached to a syringe is inserted into the mass or area of nodularity. Suction is applied to the syringe, and multiple passes are made through the mass. A simple cyst often disappears on aspiration, and the fluid is usually discarded if it is nonbloody. If the material is bloody, however, it most likely indicates malignancy and should be sent for cytology; this is performed either directly as a smear or after the fluid is centrifuged (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3768">Obeng-Gyasi, Grimm, Hwang, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). For nonpalpable masses, the same procedure can be performed by a radiologist using ultrasound guidance (ultrasound-guided FNA).</p>
<p class="indent">FNA is less expensive than other diagnostic methods, and results are usually available quickly. However, false-negative or false-positive results are possible, and appropriate follow-up depends on the clinical judgment of the treating physician.</p>
<p class="h7">Core Needle Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Core needle biopsy is similar to FNA, except that a larger-gauge needle is used (usually 11- to 18-gauge). A local anesthetic is applied, and tissue cores are removed via a spring-loaded device. This procedure allows for a more definitive diagnosis than FNA, because actual tissue, not just cells, is removed. It is often performed for relatively large tumors that are close to the skin surface, but is also utilized for smaller, deeper lesions that are visible on ultrasound.</p>
<p class="h7">Stereotactic Core Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stereotactic core biopsy:&lt;/b&gt; computer-guided method of core needle biopsy that is useful when masses or calcifications in the breast cannot be felt but can be visualized using mammography">Stereotactic core biopsy</button></strong> is performed on nonpalpable lesions detected by mammography. The patient lies prone on the stereotactic table. The breast is suspended through an opening in the table and compressed between two x-ray plates. Images are then obtained using digital mammography. The exact coordinates of the lesion to be sampled are located with the aid of a computer. Next, a local anesthetic is injected into the entry site on the breast. A small nick is made in the skin, a core needle is inserted, and samples of the tissue are taken for pathologic examination. Often, several passes are taken to ensure that the lesion is well sampled. Postbiopsy images are then taken to check that sampling has been adequate. A small titanium clip is almost always placed at the biopsy site so that the site can easily be located if further treatment is indicated (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Obeng-Gyasi et al., 2018</a>). Stereotactic biopsy is quite accurate and often allows the patient to avoid a surgical biopsy. However, there is a small false-negative rate. Appropriate follow-up depends on the final pathologic diagnosis and the clinical judgment of the primary provider. The use of a titanium clip does not preclude subsequent MRIs.</p>
<p class="h7">Ultrasound-Guided Core Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent">The principles for ultrasound-guided core biopsy are similar to those of stereotactic core biopsy, but by using ultrasound guidance, computer coordination and mammographic compression are not necessary. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy does not use radiation and is also usually faster and less expensive than stereotactic core biopsy.</p>
<p class="h7">Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#x2013;Guided Core Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent">MRI-guided core biopsy can be performed by a radiologist and technologist when the abnormal area in the breast is too small to be felt but is visible on MRI.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;surgical biopsy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of all or a portion of a mass for microscopic examination by a pathologist">Surgical biopsy</button></strong> is usually performed using local anesthesia and IV sedation. After an incision is made, the lesion is excised and sent to a laboratory for pathologic examination. Surgical biopsy is usually preceded by a core biopsy or stereotactic biopsy for pathologic determination.</p>
<p class="h7">Types of Surgical Breast Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are several types of procedures used for a surgical breast biopsy including an excisional or incisional biopsy, and a wire needle localization.</p>
<p class="h8">Excisional Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Excisional biopsy is the standard procedure for complete pathologic assessment of a palpable breast mass. The entire mass, plus a margin of surrounding tissue, is removed. This type of biopsy may also be referred to as a lumpectomy. Depending on the clinical situation, a frozen-section analysis of the specimen may be performed at the time of the biopsy by the pathologist, who does an immediate reading intraoperatively and provides a provisional diagnosis. This can help confirm a diagnosis in a patient who has had no previous tissue analysis performed.</p>
<p class="h8">Incisional Biopsy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Incisional biopsy surgically removes a portion of a mass. This is performed to confirm a diagnosis and to conduct special studies (e.g., ER/PR, HER-2/neu [also referred to as ERBB2]; see later discussion for explanation of these terms) that will aid in determining treatment, which is discussed later in this chapter. Complete excision of the area may not be possible or immediately beneficial to the patient, depending on the clinical situation. This procedure is often performed on women with locally advanced breast cancer or on women with suspected cancer recurrence, whose treatment may depend on the results of these special studies. However, pathologic information may be easily obtained from core needle biopsy, and incisional biopsy is becoming less common.</p>
<p class="h8">Wire Needle Localization</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wire needle localization is a technique used to locate nonpalpable masses or suspicious calcium deposits detected on a mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI that require an excisional biopsy. The radiologist inserts a long, thin wire through a needle, which is then inserted into the area of abnormality using x-ray or ultrasound guidance (whichever imaging technique originally identified the abnormality). The wire remains in place after the needle is withdrawn to ensure the precise location. The patient is then taken to the operating room, where the surgeon follows the wire to the tip and excises the area.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Implications</p>
<p class="nonindent">During the preoperative or preprocedure visit, the nurse assesses the patient for any specific educational, physical, or psychosocial needs. This can be accomplished by reviewing the medical and psychosocial history and encouraging the patient to verbalize fears, concerns, and questions. Patients <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1717" title="1717"></span>are often worried not only about the procedure but also about the potential implications of the pathology results. Providing a thorough explanation about what to expect in a supportive manner can help alleviate anxiety. Patients often have difficulty absorbing all the information given to them; therefore, written materials to take home are often provided to reinforce and clarify education.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse instructs the patient to discontinue any agents that can increase the risk of bleeding, including products containing aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E supplements, herbal substances (such as ginkgo biloba and garlic supplements). Patients on prescription anticoagulants need to check with the prescriber prior to temporary cessation for the procedure, as biopsies done without cessation of these drugs can result in prolonged bleeding and hematomas. The patient may be instructed not to eat or drink for several hours prior to the procedure or after midnight the night before the procedure, depending on the type of biopsy and anesthesia planned. Most breast biopsy procedures are performed with the use of the combination of sedation and local anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediate assessment after the procedure includes monitoring the effects of the anesthesia and inspecting the surgical dressing for any signs of bleeding. Once the sedation has worn off, the nurse reviews the care of the biopsy site, pain management, and activity restrictions with the patient. Prior to discharge from the ambulatory surgical center or the office, the patient must be able to tolerate fluids, ambulate, and void. The patient must be accompanied home by an adult. The dressing covering the incision is usually removed after 48 hours, but the Steri-Strips, which are applied directly over the incision, should remain in place for approximately 7 to 10&#x00A0;days or until they fall off. The use of a supportive bra following surgery is encouraged to limit movement of the breast and reduce discomfort. A follow-up telephone call from the nurse 24 to 48 hours after the procedure can provide the patient with the opportunity to ask any questions and can be a source of great comfort and reassurance.</p>
<p class="indent">Most women return to their usual activities the day after the procedure but are encouraged to avoid jarring or high-impact activities for 1 week to promote healing of the biopsy site. Discomfort is usually minimal, and most women find acetaminophen sufficient for pain relief, although a mild opioid analgesic agent may be prescribed if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Follow-up after the biopsy includes a return visit to the surgeon for discussion of the final pathology report and assessment of the healing of the biopsy site. Depending on the results of the biopsy, the nurse&#x2019;s role varies. If the pathology report is benign, the nurse reviews incision care and explains what the patient should expect as the biopsy site heals (i.e., changes in sensation may occur weeks or months after the biopsy due to nerve injury within the breast tissue). If a diagnosis of cancer is made, the nurse&#x2019;s role changes dramatically. This is discussed in depth later in this chapter.</p>
