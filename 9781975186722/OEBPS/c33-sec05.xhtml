<h4 class="h4" id="s1311"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1049" title="1049"></span>Allergic Rhinitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Allergic rhinitis (hay fever, seasonal allergic rhinitis) is the most common form of respiratory allergy, which is mediated by an immediate (type I hypersensitivity) immunologic reaction. In the United States approximately 20 million adults have allergic rhinitis (CDC, 2017). Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are essential to reduce complications and relieve symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Because allergic rhinitis is induced by airborne pollens or molds, it is characterized by the following seasonal occurrences (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018a):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Early spring&#x2014;tree pollen</span></li>
<li><span>Early summer&#x2014;grass pollen</span></li>
<li><span>Early fall&#x2014;weed pollen (ragweed)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Each year, attacks begin and end at about the same time. Airborne mold spores require warm, damp weather. Although there is no rigid seasonal pattern, these spores appear in early spring, are rampant during the summer, then taper off and disappear by the first frost in areas that experience dramatic seasonal temperature variation. In temperate areas that do not experience freezing temperatures, these allergens, especially mold, can persist throughout the year.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1312">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergen-specific IgE-mediated immunologic response. Sensitization most commonly begins by inhalation of antigen. IgE antibodies are stimulated and bind to mast cells in the respiratory mucosa, basophils in the peripheral blood, and eosinophils in the nasal and respiratory mucosa. Eosinophilia in the tissues is the key characteristic of allergic rhinitis. When IgE antibodies bind to mast cells there is histamine release. Histamine is the major mediator of allergic reactions in the nasal mucosa. Inflammation, tissue edema, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability occur (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1313">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, conjunctivitis, and nasal obstruction. Postnasal drip, cough, itching of the eyes, and fatigue are often present. If symptoms are severe, allergic rhinitis may interfere with sleep, leisure, school, work, and overall quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with chronic sinusitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and asthma. Infraorbital edema and dilation of peripheral vessels (due to histamine) can cause darkening under the eyes, sometimes referred to as &#x201C;allergic shiners.&#x201D; A horizontal nasal crease can develop from constant rubbing of the nose; commonly referred to as the &#x201C;allergic salute.&#x201D; The nasal mucosa can exhibit a grayish hue. Clear rhinorrhea, tonsillar hyperplasia, and postnasal rhinorrhea may be visible on examination of the throat. Tympanic membranes can be retracted or serous fluid may accumulate in the middle ear. Some patients can suffer oral allergy syndrome (OAS) with itching and irritation of the hard and soft palate. Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis can trigger migraine headache in some patients (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1314">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis is mainly based on history and physical examination. Blood or laboratory testing is usually unnecessary. Diagnostic testing can be done with immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (skin prick testing). In sensitive patients, testing with select diagnostic solutions of tree, grass, or weed pollen, mold, house dust mites, and animal allergens results in a wheal-and-flare reaction at the skin test site within 20 minutes. IgE immunoassay can provide similar information to skin prick test. Nasal cytology can be performed to differentiate rhinitis due to allergy from that due to infection, although it is relatively nonspecific and insensitive (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1315">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of therapy is to provide relief from symptoms. Therapy may include one or all of the following interventions: avoidance therapy, pharmacologic therapy, and immunotherapy. Verbal instructions must be reinforced by written information. Knowledge of general concepts regarding assessment and therapy in allergic diseases is important so that the patient can learn to manage certain conditions as well as prevent severe reactions and illnesses.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Avoidance Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In avoidance therapy, every attempt is made to remove the allergens that act as precipitating factors. Simple measures and environmental controls are often effective in decreasing symptoms. Examples include the use of air conditioners, air cleaners, humidifiers, and dehumidifiers; removal of dust-catching furnishings, carpets, and window coverings; removal of pets from the home or bedroom; the use of pillow and mattress covers that are impermeable to dust mites; and a smoke-free environment (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Platts-Mills, 2019</a>). Additional measures include changing clothing when coming in from outside, showering to wash allergens from hair and skin, and using an over-the-counter nasal irrigation device or saline nasal spray to reduce allergens in the nasal passages Because multiple allergens are often implicated, multiple measures to avoid exposure to allergens are often necessary. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers and vacuum cleaner filters may also be used to reduce allergens in the environment (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Platts-Mills, 2019</a>). Multiple avoidance strategies tailored to a person&#x2019;s risk factors can reduce the severity of symptoms, the number of work or school days missed because of symptoms, and the number of unscheduled health care visits for treatment. In many cases, it is impossible to avoid exposure to all environmental allergens, so pharmacologic therapy or immunotherapy is needed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many antihistamines, corticosteroid nasal sprays, adrenergic agents, mast cell stabilizers, nasal decongestant sprays, and corticosteroids are pharmacologic agents used in allergic rhinitis.</p>
<p class="h7">Antihistamines</p>
<p class="nonindent">First-generation antihistamines, which are readily absorbed, are most effective when administered orally at the first occurrence of symptoms because they prevent the development of new symptoms. Diphenhydramine is a common first-generation antihistamine available in over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Others include chlorpheniramine and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1050" title="1050"></span>hydroxyzine. First-generation antihistamines bind to histamine 1 receptors and can effectively relieve symptoms of hay fever, vasomotor rhinitis, urticaria (hives), and mild asthma. However, first-generation antihistamines cross the blood&#x2013;brain barrier and cause significant sedation which impairs cognitive function and psychomotor performance. First-generation antihistamines can also have anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, blurry vision, urinary hesitancy, and confusion. Due to their anticholinergic effects, first-generation antihistamines should be avoided in older adults (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2403">Fick, Semla, Steinman, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). First-generation antihistamines have a limited role in the treatment of allergy due to their adverse effects (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Second-generation (nonsedating H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists) are antihistamines that do not cross the blood&#x2013;brain barrier to the same extent as first-generation antihistamines. They mainly bind to peripheral rather than central nervous system H<sub>1</sub> receptors, causing less sedation. Examples of these OTC medications are loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Sanchez-Borges &#x0026; Ansotegui, 2019</a>). Contraindications, major side effects, nursing implications, and patient education for select H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines can be found in <a href="#tt33-2">Table 33-2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">If H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines are not completely effective, H<sub>2</sub> antihistamines such as famotidine, which blocks the H<sub>2</sub> receptors found in the stomach, vascular smooth muscle, and elsewhere, can be added to the drug regimen. It is given twice a day with the same total dose as for gastroesophageal reflux. H<sub>2</sub> antihistamines do not relieve urticaria on their own, but can augment the effect of H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Randall &#x0026; Hawkins, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Antihistamines may also be combined with decongestants to reduce the nasal congestion associated with allergies. Most combination products are available as OTC medications; examples are loratadine/pseudoephedrine and cetirizine/pseudoephedrine. Decongestants can cause an increase in blood pressure; therefore, patients with a history of hypertension should be cautioned about long-term use of any medication that contains decongestants (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Randall &#x0026; Hawkins, 2018</a>). Decongestants are contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy and should be used with caution in patients with closed-angle glaucoma, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or bladder neck obstruction.</p>
<p class="indent">Antihistamine nasal sprays azelastine and olopatadine are available by prescription. They not only reduce inflammation and decrease nasal congestion, but also have rapid onset of action and can be used &#x201C;on demand&#x201D; (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="h7">Corticosteroid Nasal Spray</p>
<p class="nonindent">Corticosteroid nasal sprays are recognized as the most effective pharmacotherapy for allergic rhinitis. These anti-inflammatory agents work directly on the nasal mucosa but take a few hours to work. The patient should understand that maximal therapeutic effectiveness of these agents can take 1 to 2 weeks. They are recommended as the best single therapy for patients with mild to moderate or moderate to severe symptoms (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Berger &#x0026; Melizer, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroid nasal sprays are derived from hydrocortisone and are divided into first-generation and second-generation agents. Beclomethasone, flunisolide, triamcinolone, and budesonide are first-generation agents, whereas flucatisone, mometasone, and ciclesonide are second-generation agents (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroid nasal spray therapy should begin with the maximal dose for patient age. Once patient symptoms are adequately controlled, the dose can be reduced at 1-week intervals to the lowest effective dose that controls symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms usually need daily use of the nasal spray. Some patients may find relief of symptoms with use of the nasal spray every other day or as needed. Newer second-generation corticosteroid spray preparations act rapidly (within 3 to 12 hours), and as-needed use appears to be effective. This kind of treatment may be adequate in patients with episodic symptoms (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Adverse effects of corticosteroid nasal sprays are mild and include drying of the nasal mucosa and burning and itching sensations caused by the vehicle used to administer the medication. Beclomethasone, budesonide, flunisolide, and triamcinolone are deactivated rapidly after absorption, so they do not achieve significant blood levels. Inhaled corticosteroids do not affect the immune system to the same degree as systemic corticosteroids (i.e., oral corticosteroids). Because corticosteroids are inhaled into the upper respiratory tract, tuberculosis or untreated bacterial infections of the lungs may become apparent and progress. Whenever possible, patients with tuberculosis or other bacterial infections of the lungs should avoid corticosteroid nasal sprays (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of an antihistamine and a corticosteroid nasal spray may be helpful for patients who do not obtain sufficient relief with one agent. A combination spray containing azelastine and fluticasone is available (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="h7">Adrenergic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Alpha-adrenergic agonist (also called sympathomimetic) medications, such as pseudoephedrine, can be used as decongestants in allergies. These agents activate alpha-adrenergic receptor sites on the smooth muscle causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosal blood vessels, reducing local blood flow, fluid exudation, and mucosal edema. Oral alpha-adrenergic medications have a systemic effect and are not recommended as first-line treatment of allergic rhinitis (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2420">Laccourreye, et al., 2015</a>). Oral alpha-adrenergic agents are also available in combination with antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine and pseudoephredine fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine). Alpha-adrenergic topical nasal spray (e.g., oxymetazoline) is also available. Alpha-adrenergic agonist ophthalmic drops, such as tetrahydrozoline, are commonly used for allergic conjunctivitis as they vasoconstrict the blood vessels of the eye.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many potential side effects of oral alpha-adrenergic agonists. These include hypertension, arrhythmias, palpitations, central nervous system stimulation, irritability, tremor, and tachyphylaxis. Oral adrenergic agents are not first-line agents in allergy and have potential for cardiovascular and neurological adverse effects (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b). The topical preparations (i.e., drops and sprays) of alpha-adrenergic agonists cause fewer side effects than oral medications; however, the use of drops and sprays should be limited to a few days to avoid rebound congestion, also referred to as rhinitis medicamentosa.</p>
<p class="indent">The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 banned OTC sales of medications that contain the ingredients pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine as these can be used to make methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant. Laws to enforce this act vary state by state. There is a legal age requirement to purchase these drugs and pharmacists must limit and keep records of the amount purchased. Some states require a prescription (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2017).</p>

<p class="h7">Mast Cell Stabilizers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Intranasal cromolyn sodium is a spray that acts by stabilizing the mast cell membrane, thus reducing the release of histamine and other mediators of the allergic response. In addition, it inhibits macrophages, eosinophils, monocytes, and platelets involved in the immune response. Cromolyn <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1052" title="1052"></span>interrupts the physiologic response to nasal antigens, and it is used prophylactically (before the exposure to allergens) to prevent the onset of symptoms and to treat symptoms once they occur. It is also used therapeutically in chronic allergic rhinitis. This spray is as effective as antihistamines but is less effective than corticosteroid nasal sprays in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is best to use this agent 30 minutes prior to exposure to allergen. Frequent use is necessary to obtain an effect (1 to 2 nasal sprays 4 times per day). The patient must be informed that the beneficial effects of the medication may take a week or longer to manifest. The medication is of no benefit in the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis. Adverse effects (e.g., sneezing, local stinging and burning sensations) are usually mild (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="h7">Nasal Decongestant Sprays</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nasal decongestant sprays include phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, and naphazoline. These agents vasoconstrict blood vessels in the nasal mucosa by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors. Nasal decongestant sprays are not recommended as monotherapy. After using these agents for 3 to 7 days, reduced sensitivity of alpha-adrenergic receptors develops which can cause worsening nasal congestion. This effect of worsening nasal congestion often causes patients to overuse these agents with less and less therapeutic effect. This is termed rhinitis medicamentosa and can lead to increased need for the agent and eventual dependency (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Wahid &#x0026; Shermetaro, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of a topical nasal decongestant and topical corticosteroid may effectively treat symptoms without causing rhinitis medicamentosa. Nasal decongestants are helpful when used just before air travel in patients who have difficulties with middle ear or sinus equilibration with flying or in patients who have problems with altitude changes (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b).</p>
<p class="h7">Corticosteroids</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oral and parenteral corticosteroids can be used when conventional therapy has failed and symptoms are severe and of short duration. They can control symptoms of allergic reactions such as hay fever, medication-induced allergies, and allergic reactions to insect stings. However, corticosteroids have a delayed onset of action and cannot be used for immediate relief of allergic symptoms. The agents are not effective as singular treatment for severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis (deShazo &#x0026; Kemp, 2018b). Oral corticosteroids in the lowest dose to control symptoms for the shortest period of time may be prescribed if other agents fail. However, corticosteroids are usually avoided because of their side effects.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients who receive high-dose or long-term corticosteroid therapy must be cautioned not to stop taking the medication suddenly. Doses are tapered when discontinuing this medication to avoid adrenal insufficiency.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The patient should be cautioned about side effects, which include fluid retention, weight gain, hypertension, gastric irritation, glucose intolerance, osteoporosis, immunosuppression, and adrenal suppression. Further discussion of corticosteroids is provided in <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>, <a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#tt45-3">Table 45-3</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists</p>
<p class="nonindent">Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that cause bronchospasm, vascular permeability, and activation of leukocytes. They are three to four times more potent than histamine in perpetuating inflammation in the upper respiratory tract (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells, 2017</a>). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), such as zafirlukast and montelukast, block the synthesis or action of leukotrienes and prevent the signs and symptoms associated with asthma (see <a href="#tt33-3">Table 33-3</a>). LTRAs are also used to counteract allergic rhinitis.</p>
<p class="indent">Montelukast efficacy has been compared to a second-generation antihistamine agent. In combination with a second-generation antihistamine such as loratadine, montelukast has shown to be more effective than montelukast alone. Adverse effects of montelukast include neuropsychiatric changes such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This agent may be not appropriate for patients with preexisting mood disorders (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Badri &#x0026; Takov, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Leukotriene receptor antagonists are for long-term use, and patients should be advised to take their medication daily. LTRAs are not effective as &#x201C;rescue&#x201D; medications. Patients take appropriate &#x201C;rescue&#x201D; medications for symptom exacerbation but continue to take the LTRA on a daily basis. Studies report that using an LTRA in conjunction with an inhaled corticosteroid is effective for mild persistent asthma (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2394">Chauchan, Jeyaraman, Singh Mann, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Allergen Immunotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is primarily used to treat IgE-mediated diseases by injections of allergen extracts. Immunotherapy, also referred to as allergy vaccine therapy, involves the administration of gradually increasing quantities of specific allergens to the patient until a dose is reached that is effective in reducing disease severity from natural exposure. This is an effective treatment for 80% to 90% of certain allergens such as grass and pollen. This type of therapy provides <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1053" title="1053"></span>an adjunct to symptomatic pharmacologic therapy and can be used when avoidance of allergens is not possible. Specific immunotherapy has been used in the treatment of allergic disorders for many years. Goals of immunotherapy include reducing the level of circulating IgE, increasing the level of blocking antibody IgG, and reducing mediator cell sensitivity. Immunotherapy has been most effective for ragweed pollen, grass, tree pollen, cat dander, and house dust mite allergens (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Akdis, 2018</a>). Indications and contraindications for immunotherapy are presented in <a href="#ct33-5">Chart 33-5</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Correlation of a positive skin test with a positive allergy history is an indication for immunotherapy if the allergen cannot be avoided. The benefit of immunotherapy has been fairly well established in instances of allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma that are clearly due to sensitivity to one of the common pollens, molds, or household dust. Unlike antiallergy medication, allergen immunotherapy has the potential to alter the allergic disease course after 3 to 5 years of therapy. Because it may prevent the progression or development of asthma or multiple or additional allergies, it is also considered to be a potential preventive measure. The patient must understand what to expect and the importance of continuing therapy for several years before immunotherapy is accomplished. When skin tests are performed, the results are correlated with symptoms; treatment is based on the patient&#x2019;s needs rather than on the results of skin tests (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2417">Klimek, Pfaar, Bousquet, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are three methods of immunotherapy: subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT).</p>
<p class="h7">Subcutaneous Immunotherapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common method of treatment is SCIT, which consists of the serial injection of one or more antigens that are selected in each particular case on the basis of skin testing. This method provides a simple and efficient technique for targeting IgE antibodies to specific antigens. Specific treatment consists of injecting extracts of the allergens that cause symptoms in a particular patient. Injections begin with very small amounts and are gradually increased, usually at weekly intervals, until a maximum tolerated dose is attained. Although severe systemic reactions are rare, the risk of systemic and potentially fatal anaphylaxis exists. It tends to occur most frequently at the induction or &#x201C;up-dosing&#x201D; phase. Therefore, the patient must be monitored after administration of immunotherapy. Because of the risk of anaphylaxis, injections should not be given by a lay person or by the patient. The patient must remain in the office or clinic for at least 30 minutes after the injection and is observed for possible systemic symptoms. If a large, local swelling develops at the injection site, the next dose should not be increased, because this may be a warning sign of a possible systemic reaction (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">James &#x0026; Bernstein, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Maintenance booster injections are given at 2- to 4-week intervals, frequently for a period of several years, before the maximum benefit is achieved, although some patients will note early improvement in their symptoms. Long-term benefit seems to be related to the cumulative dose of vaccine given over time (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Nelson, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Because the injection of an allergen may induce systemic reactions, such injections are given only in a setting where epinephrine is immediately available (i.e., primary provider&#x2019;s office, clinic).</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Sublingual Immunotherapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">SLIT has been reported to have a 30% to 40% reduction in reactions and rescue medication usage in seasonal allergic rhinitis. Administration of SLIT includes a buildup phase that is followed by a treatment plan of three times per week with a rapid dissolving tablet or liquid containing allergen extracts. Recent studies show comparable efficacy of SLIT with SCIT (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2393">Chaaban, Mansi, Tripple, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Durham &#x0026; Penagos, 2016</a>). Systemic side effects are rare but have been reported in patients who also report systemic reactions with SCIT. Side effects include irritation, minor swelling or itching inside the mouth, and stomach upset and nausea.</p>
<p class="h7">Epicutaneous Immunotherapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">EPIT is an investigational alternative allergen immunotherapy with delivery of the allergen to the epidermis. Because the epidermis is less vascular, it is theorized that there is reduced risk of systemic allergic side effect. Epicutaneous allergen patches are applied to the upper inner arm or interscapular region of the back. Doses are lower than those used in SCIT or SLIT. The allergen is soluble and absorbed into the skin. Adverse reactions include localized erythema, pruritus, and urticaria at the site of allergen patch. Studies of EPIT have shown modest results compared to placebo, and there has been a higher rate of treatment-related mild to moderate anaphylactic reactions. Long-term studies of EPIT are currently in progress for peanut allergies (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Nowak-Wegrzyn, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Immunotherapy should not be initiated during pregnancy; for patients who have been receiving immunotherapy before pregnancy, the dosage should not be increased during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="indent">Therapeutic failure is evident when a patient does not experience a decrease of symptoms within 12 to 24 months, fails to develop increased tolerance to known allergens, and cannot decrease the use of medications to reduce symptoms. Potential causes of treatment failure include misdiagnosis of allergies, inadequate doses of allergen, newly developed allergies, and inadequate environmental controls (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Akdis, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The examination and history of the patient reveal sneezing, often in paroxysms; thin and watery nasal discharge; itching eyes and nose; lacrimation; and occasionally headache. The health history includes a personal or family history of allergy. The allergy assessment identifies the nature of antigens, seasonal changes in symptoms, and medication history. The nurse also obtains subjective data about how the patient feels just before symptoms become obvious, such as the occurrence of pruritus, breathing problems, and tingling sensations. In addition to these symptoms, hoarseness, wheezing, hives, rash, erythema, and edema are noted. Any relationship between emotional problems or stress and the triggering of allergy symptoms is assessed (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kakli &#x0026; Riley, 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient may include restoration of a breathing pattern that provides adequate ventilation, increased knowledge about the causes and control of allergic symptoms, improved coping with alterations and modifications, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> B<small>REATHING</small> P<small>ATTERN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is instructed and assisted to modify the environment to reduce the severity of allergic symptoms or to prevent their occurrence. The patient is also instructed to reduce exposure to people with upper respiratory tract infections. Adherence to medication schedules and other treatment regimens is encouraged and reinforced.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> U<small>NDERSTANDING OF</small> A<small>LLERGY AND</small> A<small>LLERGY</small> C<small>ONTROL</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Instruction includes strategies to minimize exposure to allergens and explanation about desensitization procedures and correct use of medications. The nurse informs and reminds the patient of the importance of keeping appointments for desensitization procedures, because dosages are usually adjusted on a weekly basis, and missed appointments may interfere with the dosage adjustment (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Pitsios &#x0026; Dietis, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients need to understand the difference between rescue medications for allergy exacerbation and seasonal flares (e.g., antihistamines) and medications used for allergy control throughout the year (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers). Patients also need to understand that medications for allergy exacerbation and seasonal flares should be used only when the allergy is apparent. Continued use of these medications when not required can result in tolerance; consequently, the medications will be ineffective when needed (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Pitsios &#x0026; Dietis, 2019</a>; <a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Scadding, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OPING WITH A</small> C<small>HRONIC</small> D<small>ISORDER</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Although allergic reactions are infrequently life-threatening, they require vigilance to avoid allergens and modification of the lifestyle or environment to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Allergic symptoms are often present year-round and create discomfort and inconvenience for the patient. Although patients may not feel ill during allergy seasons, they often do not feel well, either. The need to be alert for possible allergens in the environment may be tiresome, placing a burden on the patient&#x2019;s ability to lead a normal life. Stress related to these difficulties may in turn increase the frequency or severity of symptoms. To assist the patient in adjusting to these modifications, the nurse must have an appreciation of the difficulties encountered by the patient. The patient is encouraged to verbalize feelings and concerns in a supportive environment and to identify strategies to deal with them effectively (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Scadding, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Anaphylaxis and Impaired Breathing.</span> Respiratory and cardiovascular functioning can be significantly altered during allergic reactions by the reaction itself or by the medications used to treat reactions. Anaphylaxis is an acute, systemic reaction that causes vasodilation and bronchiole constriction which can lead to hypotensive shock and asphyxiation. The respiratory status is evaluated by monitoring the respiratory rate and pattern and by assessing for breathing difficulties or abnormal lung sounds. The pulse rate and rhythm and blood pressure are monitored to assess cardiovascular status regularly or any time the patient reports symptoms such as itching or difficulty breathing. In the event of signs and symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis, emergency medications and equipment must be available for immediate use. People with severe allergic reactions may be advised to carry an autoinjectable epinephrine device (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Song &#x0026; Lieberman, 2019</a>). See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for treatment of anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Nonadherence to the Therapeutic Regimen.</span> Knowledge about the treatment regimen does not ensure adherence. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1055" title="1055"></span>Having the patient identify potential barriers and explore acceptable solutions for effective management of the condition (e.g., installing tile floors rather than carpet, not gardening in the spring) can increase adherence to the treatment regimen (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Pitsios &#x0026; Dietis, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED</small>, <small>AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient is instructed about strategies to minimize exposure to allergens, the actions and adverse effects of medications, and the correct use of medications. The patient should know the name, dose, frequency, actions, and side effects of all medications taken.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Instruction about strategies to control allergic symptoms is based on the needs of the patient as determined by the results of tests, the severity of symptoms, and the motivation of the patient and family to deal with the condition (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Pitsios &#x0026; Dietis, 2019</a>). Suggestions for patients who are sensitive to dust and mold in the home are given in <a href="#ct33-6">Chart 33-6</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient is to undergo allergen immunotherapy (AIT), the nurse reinforces the primary provider&#x2019;s explanation regarding the purpose and procedure. Instructions are given regarding the series of injections, which usually are given initially every week and then at 2- to 4-week intervals. These instructions include remaining in the primary provider&#x2019;s office or the clinic for at least 30 minutes after the injection, so that emergency treatment can be given if the patient has a reaction; avoiding rubbing or scratching the injection site; and continuing with the series for the period of time required. In addition, the patient and family are instructed about emergency treatment of severe allergic symptoms (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">James &#x0026; Bernstein, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because antihistamines may produce drowsiness, the patient is cautioned about this and other side effects applicable to the medication. Operating machinery, driving a car, and performing activities that require intense concentration should be postponed. The patient is also informed about the dangers of drinking alcohol when taking antihistamines, because they tend to exaggerate the effects of alcohol.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient must be aware of the effects caused by overuse of the sympathomimetic agents in nose drops or sprays, because rhinitis medicamentosa may result. After topical application of the medication, a rebound period occurs in which the nasal mucous membranes become more edematous and congested than they were before the medication was used. Such a reaction encourages the use of more medication, and a cyclic pattern results. The topical agent must be discontinued immediately and completely to correct this problem (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Wahid &#x0026; Shermetaro, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Follow-up telephone calls to the patient are often reassuring to the patient and family and provide an opportunity for the nurse to answer any questions. The patient is reminded to keep follow-up appointments and informed about the importance of continuing with treatment. The importance of participating in health promotion activities and health screening is also emphasized.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
