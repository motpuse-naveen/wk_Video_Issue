<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;external fixator:&lt;/b&gt; external metal frame attached to bone fragments to stabilize them">External fixator</button></strong> devices are used to manage fractures with large amounts of soft tissue damage. Complicated fractures of the humerus, forearm, femur, tibia, and pelvis are also managed with external skeletal fixators. They are also used to correct defects, treat nonunion, and lengthen limbs. Their use has increased in recent years with advances in orthopedic trauma care. The fixator provides skeletal stability for severe comminuted (crushed or splintered) fractures while permitting active treatment of extensive soft tissue damage (see <a href="#ff37-9">Fig. 37-9</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">External fixation is a technique that involves the surgical insertion of pins through the skin and soft tissues into and through the bone. A metal external frame is attached to these pins and is designed to hold the fracture in proper alignment to enable healing to occur (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kani, Porrino, &#x0026; Chew, 2020</a>). Advantages of external fixation, compared to other modes of treatment, include immediate fracture stabilization, minimization of blood loss (in comparison to internal fixation), increased patient comfort, improved wound care, promotion of early mobilization and weight bearing on the affected limb, and active exercise of adjacent uninvolved joints (AAOS, 2019d). The disadvantages are an increased risk for pin site loosening and infection, which can lead to osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and progressive pain (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2786">Sayed, Mohammed, Mostafa, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1531">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients should be prepared psychologically for application of the external fixator, as they may be at risk for an altered body image related to the size and bulk of the apparatus. To promote acceptance of the device, patients should be given comprehensive information about the frame and reassurance that the discomfort associated with the device is minimal and that early mobility is anticipated (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Walker, 2018</a>); however, among patients who have had significant trauma, there may not be time to engage them in this type of preparation. Nurses should initiate open discussions to help patients describe their concerns about the apparatus and expectations about care.</p>
<p class="indent">After the external fixator is applied, the extremity is elevated to the level of the heart to reduce swelling, if appropriate. Any sharp points on the fixator or pins are covered with caps to prevent device-induced injuries. The nurse must be alert for potential problems caused by pressure from the device on the skin, nerves, or blood vessels and for the development of acute compartment syndrome. The nurse monitors the neurovascular status of the extremity every 2 to 4 hours and promptly reports changes to the primary provider (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Hadeed, Werntz, &#x0026; Varacallo, 2019</a>). Because the pins are inserted externally, particular attention is focused on the pin sites for signs of inflammation and infection. The goal is to avoid osteomyelitis. The nurse assesses each pin site at least every 8 to 12 hours for redness, swelling, pain around the pin sites, warmth, and purulent drainage, because these are the most common indicators of pin site infections. In the first 48 to 72 hours postinsertion, some serous drainage, skin warmth, and mild redness at the pin sites are expected (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Walker, 2018</a>); these are expected to subside after 72 hours.</p>
<p class="indent">Currently, there is no consensus or research-based evidence to direct the best method for cleansing and dressing percutaneous pin sites to minimize infection rates and complications (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Lobst, 2017</a>). Additionally, there continues to be a lack of evidence regarding best management of crusting on pin sites (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2722">Georgiades, 2018</a>). In the absence of such research, aseptic technique during pin insertion is advised (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Gasiorowski, 2017</a>), along with general strategies such as cleansing each pin site separately to avoid cross contamination with nonshedding material (e.g., gauze, cotton-tip swab) and using chlorhexidine 2 mg/mL solution once weekly. Chlorhexidine can be an allergen, however. Therefore, the patient should be monitored for manifestations of an allergic reaction, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1173" title="1173"></span>may include pruritus and/or contact dermatitis at the pin site, or, rarely in severe cases, angioedema and even anaphylactic shock (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2692">Campbell &#x0026; Watt, 2020</a>). Pin sites should be cleaned and dressed as prescribed unless there is copious drainage, the dressing becomes wet, or infection is suspected, in which case cleaning and dressing may be more frequent. If signs of an allergic reaction or infection are present or if the pins or clamps seem loose, the nurse notifies the primary provider.</p>

<p class="indent">If activity is restricted, the nurse encourages isometric exercises as tolerated to prevent complications of mobility (e.g., thrombus formation). When the swelling subsides, the nurse helps the patient become mobile within the prescribed weight-bearing limits (non&#x2013;weight bearing to full weight bearing). Adherence to weight-bearing instructions minimizes the chance of loosening of the pins when stress is applied to the bone&#x2013;pin interface. The external fixator may be removed once the soft tissue heals and there are no signs of infection. The fracture may require additional stabilization by a cast, molded orthosis, or internal fixation while healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Ilizarov fixation is a specialized type of external fixator consisting of numerous wires that penetrate the limb and are attached to a circular metal frame (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kani et al., 2020</a>). This device is used to correct angulation and rotational defects, to treat nonunion (failure of bone fragments to heal), and to lengthen limbs. The device gently pulls apart the cortex of the bone and stimulates new growth through daily adjustment of the telescoping rods. The nurse must educate the patient about adjusting the telescoping rods and caring for the pin sites and apparatus, because this fixator can be in place for many months. When discharge is anticipated, the nurse educates the patient or caregiver about how to perform pin site care according to the prescribed protocol (clean technique can be used at home) and to promptly report any signs of pin site inflammation, irritation, infection, or pin loosening (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2786">Sayed et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Walker, 2018</a>). The nurse also instructs the patient or family to monitor neurovascular status and report any changes promptly. The patient or family members are instructed to check the integrity of the fixator frame daily and to report loose pins or clamps. A physical therapy referral is helpful in educating the patient how to transfer, use ambulatory aids safely, and adjust to weight-bearing limits and altered gait patterns (see <a href="#ct37-6">Chart 37-6</a>).</p>
