<h4 class="h4a" id="s2934">ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An <strong>altered level of consciousness (LOC)</strong> is present when the patient is not oriented, does not follow commands, or needs persistent stimuli to achieve a state of alertness. LOC is gauged on a continuum, with a normal state of alertness and full cognition (consciousness) on one end and coma on the other end. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;coma:&lt;/b&gt; prolonged state of unconsciousness">Coma</button></strong> is a clinical state of unarousable unresponsiveness in which there are no purposeful responses to internal or external stimuli, although nonpurposeful responses to painful stimuli and brain stem reflexes may be present. The usual duration of coma is variable. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;akinetic mutism:&lt;/b&gt; unresponsiveness to the environment; the patient makes no movement or sound but sometimes opens the eyes">Akinetic mutism</button></strong> is a state of unresponsiveness to the environment in which the patient makes no voluntary movement. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;persistent vegetative state:&lt;/b&gt; condition in which the patient is wakeful but devoid of conscious content, without cognitive or affective mental function">Persistent vegetative state</button></strong> is a condition in which the patient who is unresponsive resumes sleep&#x2013;wake cycles after coma but is devoid of cognitive or affective mental function. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;minimally conscious state:&lt;/b&gt; a state in which the patient demonstrates awareness but cannot communicate thoughts or feelings">minimally conscious state</button></strong> differs from persistent vegetative state in that the patient has inconsistent but reproducible signs of awareness (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rohaut, Eliseyev, &#x0026; Claassen, 2019</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;locked-in syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; condition resulting from a lesion in the pons in which the patient lacks all distal motor activity (paralysis) but cognition is intact">Locked-in syndrome</button></strong> results from a lesion affecting the pons and results in paralysis and the inability to speak, but vertical eye movements and lid elevation remain intact and are used to indicate responsiveness. The level of responsiveness and consciousness is the most important indicator of the patient&#x2019;s condition (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Owen, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2935">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Altered LOC is not a disorder itself; rather, it is a result of multiple pathophysiologic phenomena. The cause may be neurologic (head injury, stroke), toxicologic (drug overdose, alcohol intoxication), or metabolic (hepatic or kidney injury, diabetic ketoacidosis).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1993</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1994" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1994">p. 1994</span></div>
<p class="indent">The underlying cause of neurologic dysfunction is disruption in the cells of the nervous system, neurotransmitters, or brain anatomy (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>). Disruptions result from cellular edema or other mechanisms, such as disruption of chemical transmission at receptor sites by antibodies.</p>
<p class="indent">Intact anatomic structures of the brain are needed for normal function. The two hemispheres of the cerebrum must communicate, via an intact corpus callosum, and the lobes of the brain (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital) must communicate and coordinate their specific functions (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>). Other anatomic structures of importance are the cerebellum and the brain stem. The cerebellum has both excitatory and inhibitory actions and is largely responsible for coordination of movement. The brain stem contains areas that control the heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure. Disruptions in the anatomic structures result from trauma, edema, pressure from tumors, or other mechanisms, such as an increase or decrease in the circulation of blood or CSF.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2936">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Alterations in LOC occur along a continuum, and the clinical manifestations depend on where the patient is on this continuum. As the patient&#x2019;s state of alertness and consciousness decreases, changes occur in the pupillary response, eye opening response, verbal response, and motor response. However, initial alterations in LOC may be reflected by subtle behavioral changes, such as restlessness or increased anxiety. The pupils, normally round and quickly reactive to light, become sluggish (response is slower); as the patient becomes comatose, the pupils become fixed (no response to light). The patient in a coma does not open the eyes to voice or command, respond verbally, or move the extremities in response to a request to do so.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2937">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with an altered LOC is at risk for alterations in every body system. A complete assessment is performed, with particular attention to the neurologic system. The neurologic examination should be as complete as the LOC allows. It includes an evaluation of mental status, cranial nerve function, cerebellar function (balance and coordination), reflexes, and motor and sensory function. LOC, a sensitive indicator of neurologic function, is assessed based on the criteria in the Glasgow Coma Scale: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The patient&#x2019;s responses are rated on a scale from 3 to 15. A score of 3 indicates severe impairment of neurologic function, brain death, or pharmacologic inhibition of the neurologic response. A score of 15 indicates that the patient is fully responsive (see <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>, <a href="c63-sec02.xhtml#ct63-4">Chart 63-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is comatose and has localized signs such as abnormal pupillary and motor responses, it is assumed that neurologic disease is present until proven otherwise. If the patient is comatose but pupillary light reflexes are preserved, a toxic or metabolic disorder is suspected. Common diagnostic procedures used to identify the cause of unconsciousness include computed tomography (CT) scanning, perfusion CT (PCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and electroencephalography (EEG). Additional procedures include positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>). Ongoing research confirms EEG, MRI, and PET as important technologies in determining brain function through the evaluation of metabolic and electrical activity (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rohaut et al., 2019</a>). Laboratory tests include analysis of blood glucose, electrolytes, serum ammonia, and liver function tests; blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels; serum osmolality; calcium level; and partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times. Other studies may be used to evaluate serum ketones, alcohol and drug concentrations, and arterial blood gases.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2938">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The first priority of treatment for the patient with altered LOC is to obtain and maintain a patent airway. The patient may be orally or nasally intubated, or a tracheostomy may be performed. Until the ability of the patient to breathe is determined, a mechanical ventilator is used to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The circulatory status (blood pressure, heart rate) is monitored to ensure adequate perfusion to the body and brain. An intravenous (IV) catheter is inserted to provide access for IV fluids and medications. Neurologic care focuses on the specific neurologic pathology, if known. Nutritional support, via a feeding tube or a gastrostomy tube, is initiated as soon as possible. In addition to measures designed to determine and treat the underlying causes of altered LOC, other medical interventions are aimed at pharmacologic management and prevention of complications.</p>

<p class="processppara">Assessment of the patient with an altered LOC often starts with assessing the verbal response through determining the patient&#x2019;s orientation to time, person, and place. Patients are asked to identify the day, date, or season of the year, as well as where they are or the clinicians, family members, or visitors present. Other questions such as &#x201C;Who is the president?&#x201D; or &#x201C;What is the next holiday?&#x201D; may be helpful in determining the patient&#x2019;s processing of information. Verbal response cannot be evaluated if the patient is intubated or has a tracheostomy, and this should be clearly documented.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Alertness is measured by the patient&#x2019;s ability to open the eyes spontaneously or in response to a vocal or noxious stimulus (pressure or pain). Patients with severe neurologic dysfunction cannot do this. The nurse assesses for periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes) or trauma, which may prevent the patient from opening the eyes, and documents any such condition that interferes with eye opening.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Motor response includes spontaneous, purposeful movement (e.g., the awake patient can move all four extremities with equal strength on command), movement only in response to painful stimuli, or abnormal posturing. If the patient is not responding to commands, the motor response is tested by applying a painful stimulus (firm but gentle pressure) to the nail bed or by squeezing a muscle. If the patient attempts to push away or withdraw, the response is recorded <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1995" title="1995"></span>as purposeful or appropriate (&#x201C;Patient withdraws to painful stimulus&#x201D;). This response is considered purposeful if the patient can cross the midline from one side of the body to the other in response to a painful stimulus. An inappropriate or nonpurposeful response is random and aimless. Posturing may be decorticate or decerebrate (see <a href="#ff61-1">Fig. 61-1</a>). The most severe neurologic impairment results in flaccidity. The motor response cannot be elicited or assessed when the patient has been given pharmacologic paralyzing agents (i.e., neuromuscular-blocking agents).</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to LOC, the nurse monitors parameters such as respiratory status, eye signs, and reflexes on an ongoing basis. <a href="#tt61-1">Table 61-1</a> summarizes the assessment and the clinical significance of the findings. Body functions (circulation, respiration, elimination, fluid and electrolyte balance) are examined in a systematic and ongoing manner.</p>

<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Respiratory distress or failure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Pneumonia</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Contractures</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient with altered LOC is subject to all of the complications associated with immobility. Therefore, the goals of care for the patient with altered LOC include normalization of breathing, protection from injury, attainment of fluid volume balance, maintenance of nutritional needs, achievement of intact oral mucous membranes, maintenance of normal skin integrity, absence of corneal injury, attainment of effective thermoregulation, and effective urinary elimination. Additional goals include bowel continence, restoration of health maintenance, maintenance of intact family or support system, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because the protective reflexes of the patient who is unconscious are impaired, the quality of nursing care provided may mean the difference between life and death. The nurse must assume responsibility for the patient until the basic reflexes (coughing, blinking, and swallowing) return and the patient becomes conscious and oriented. Therefore, the major nursing goal is to compensate for the absence of these protective reflexes.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<span class="small">CHIEVING AN</span> A<span class="small">DEQUATE</span> B<span class="small">REATHING</span> P<span class="small">ATTERN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The most important consideration in managing the patient with altered LOC is to establish an adequate airway and ensure normalization of the breathing pattern. Obstruction of the airway is a risk because the epiglottis and tongue may relax, occluding the oropharynx, or the patient may aspirate vomitus or nasopharyngeal secretions.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The accumulation of secretions in the pharynx presents a serious problem. Because the patient cannot swallow and lacks pharyngeal reflexes, these secretions must be removed to eliminate the danger of aspiration. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees helps prevent aspiration. Positioning the patient in a lateral or semiprone position also helps because it allows the jaw and tongue to fall forward, thus promoting drainage of secretions.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Positioning alone is not always adequate, however. Suctioning and oral hygiene may be required. Suctioning is performed to remove secretions from the posterior pharynx and upper trachea. Before and after suctioning, the patient is adequately ventilated to prevent hypoxia (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Chest physiotherapy and postural drainage may be initiated to promote pulmonary hygiene, unless contraindicated by the patient&#x2019;s underlying condition. The chest should be auscultated at least every 8 hours to detect adventitious breath sounds or absence of breath sounds.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Despite these measures, or because of the severity of impairment, the patient with altered LOC often requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. Nursing actions for the patient who is mechanically ventilated include maintaining the patency of the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, providing frequent oral care, monitoring arterial blood gas measurements, and maintaining ventilator settings (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">For the protection of the patient, side rails are padded. Two rails are kept in the raised position during the day and three at night; however, raising all four side rails is considered a restraint by The Joint Commission if the intent is to limit the patient&#x2019;s mobility. Care should be taken to prevent injury from invasive lines and equipment, and other potential sources of injury should be identified, such as restraints, tight dressings, environmental irritants, damp bedding or dressings, and tubes and drains.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Protection also includes ensuring the patient&#x2019;s dignity during altered LOC. Simple measures such as providing privacy and speaking to the patient during nursing care activities preserve the patient&#x2019;s dignity. Not speaking negatively about the patient&#x2019;s condition or prognosis is also important, because patients in a coma may be able to hear. The patient who is comatose has an increased need for advocacy, and the nurse is responsible for seeing that these advocacy needs are met.</p>

Fluid needs are met initially by administering the required IV fluids. However, IV solutions (and blood component therapy) for patients with intracranial conditions must be given slowly. If they are given too rapidly, they can increase ICP. The quantity of fluids given may be restricted to minimize the possibility of cerebral edema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient does not recover quickly and sufficiently enough to take adequate fluids and calories by mouth, a feeding or gastrostomy tube will be inserted for the administration of fluids and enteral feedings. Research suggests that patients fed within 48 hours of injury have improved outcomes over those in whom nutrition is delayed (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4324">Lucke-Wold, Logsdon, Nguyen, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROVIDING</span> M<span class="small">OUTH</span> C<span class="small">ARE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The mouth is inspected for dryness, inflammation, and crusting. The patient who is unconscious requires careful oral care, because there is a risk of parotitis if the mouth is not kept scrupulously clean. The mouth is cleansed and rinsed carefully to remove secretions and crusts and to keep the mucous membranes moist. A thin coating of petrolatum on the lips prevents drying, cracking, and encrustations. If the patient has an endotracheal tube, the tube should be moved to the opposite side of the mouth daily to prevent ulceration of the mouth and lips. If the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, good oral care is also necessary. Research suggests that comprehensive mouth care with antiseptic such as chlorhexidine and head of bed elevation decreases ventilator-associated pneumonia and improves the oral health in patients who are intubated (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4325">Malhan, Usman, Trehan, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Preventing skin breakdown requires continuing nursing assessment and intervention. Special attention is given to patients who are unconscious, because they cannot respond to external stimuli. Assessment includes a regular schedule of turning to avoid pressure, which can cause breakdown and necrosis of the skin. Turning also provides kinesthetic (sensation of movement), proprioceptive (awareness of position), and vestibular (equilibrium) stimulation. After turning, the patient is carefully repositioned to prevent ischemic necrosis over pressure areas. Dragging or pulling the patient up in bed must be avoided, because this creates a shearing force and friction on the skin surface.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Maintaining correct body position is important; equally important is passive exercise of the extremities to prevent contractures. The use of splints or foam boots aids in the prevention of footdrop and eliminates the pressure of bedding on the toes. The use of trochanter rolls to support the hip joints keeps the legs in proper alignment. The arms are in abduction, the fingers lightly flexed, and the hands in slight supination. The heels of the feet are assessed for pressure areas. Specialty beds, such as fluidized or low&#x2013;air-loss beds, may be used to decrease pressure on bony prominences (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Some patients who are unconscious have their eyes open and have inadequate or absent corneal reflexes. The cornea may become irritated, dry, or scratched, leading to ulceration. The eyes may be cleansed with cotton balls moistened with sterile normal saline to remove debris and discharge. Artificial tears or methylcellulose may be prescribed to provide lubrication. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1998" title="1998"></span>Periorbital edema often occurs after cranial surgery. If cold compresses are prescribed, care must be exerted to avoid contact with the cornea. Eye patches should be used cautiously because of the potential for corneal abrasion from contact with the patch; eye shields may provide eye protection with less risk of injury.</p>

<p class="processppara">High fever in the patient who is unconscious may be caused by infection of the respiratory or urinary tract, drug reactions, or damage to the hypothalamic temperature-regulating center. A slight elevation of temperature may be caused by dehydration. The environment can be adjusted, depending on the patient&#x2019;s condition, to promote a normal body temperature. If body temperature is elevated, a minimum amount of bedding is used. The room may be cooled to 18.3&#x00B0;C (65&#x00B0;F). However, if the patient is an older adult and does not have an elevated temperature, a warmer environment is needed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because of damage to the temperature-regulating center in the brain or severe intracranial infection, patients who are unconscious often develop very high temperatures. Such temperature elevations must be controlled, because the increased metabolic demands of the brain can exceed cerebral circulation and oxygen delivery, potentially resulting in cerebral deterioration (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Studies suggest that hyperthermia may contribute to poor outcome after brain injury but not through a decreased brain oxygen level (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rincon, 2018</a>). Persistent hyperthermia with no identified clinical source of infection indicates brain stem damage and a poor prognosis.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient with an altered LOC is often incontinent or has urinary retention. The bladder is palpated or scanned at intervals to determine whether urinary retention is present, because a full bladder may be an overlooked cause of overflow incontinence. A portable bladder ultrasound instrument is a useful tool in bladder management and retraining programs.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient is not voiding, a program of intermittent catheterization should be devised in order to reduce the patient&#x2019;s risk of urinary tract infection. A catheter may be inserted during the acute phase of illness to monitor urinary output. Because catheters are a major cause of urinary tract infection, the patient is observed for fever and cloudy urine. The area around the urethral orifice is inspected for drainage and cleansed routinely. The urinary catheter is usually removed if the patient has a stable cardiovascular system and if no diuresis, sepsis, or voiding dysfunction existed before the onset of coma. Although many patients who are unconscious urinate spontaneously after catheter removal, the bladder should be scanned with a portable bladder ultrasound device periodically for urinary retention (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>, <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#ff47-8">Fig. 47-8</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">An external catheter (condom catheter) for the male patient and absorbent pads or female incontinence device for the female patient can be used for patients who are unconscious and can urinate spontaneously, although involuntarily. As soon as consciousness is regained, a bladder training program is initiated (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The patient who is incontinent is monitored frequently for skin irritation and skin breakdown. Appropriate skin care is implemented to prevent these complications.</p>

<p class="processppara">The abdomen is assessed for distention by listening for bowel sounds and measuring the girth of the abdomen with a tape measure. There is a risk of diarrhea from infection, antibiotic agents, and hyperosmolar fluids. Frequent loose stools may also occur with fecal impaction. Commercial fecal collection bags are available for patients with fecal incontinence (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>, <a href="c41-sec03.xhtml#ff41-1">Fig. 41-1</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Immobility and lack of dietary fiber can cause constipation. The nurse monitors the number and consistency of bowel movements and performs a rectal examination for signs of fecal impaction. Stool softeners may be prescribed and can be given with tube feedings. To facilitate bowel emptying, a glycerin suppository or bowel stimulant may be indicated. The patient may require an enema routinely to empty the lower colon.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">ESTORING</span> H<span class="small">EALTH</span> M<span class="small">AINTENANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Once increased ICP is not a problem, the nurse assists the patient and family to restore the health of the patient who is unconscious. This involves using auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and kinesthetic activities to stimulate the patient emerging from coma (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4316">Gattuta, Coralo, Lo Buono, et al., 2018</a>). Efforts are made to restore the sense of daily rhythm by maintaining usual day and night patterns for activity and sleep. The nurse touches and talks to the patient and encourages family members and friends to do so. Communication is extremely important and includes touching the patient and spending enough time with the patient to become sensitive to their needs. It is also important to avoid making any negative comments about the patient&#x2019;s status or prognosis in the patient&#x2019;s presence.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse orients the patient to time and place at least once every 8 hours. Sounds from the patient&#x2019;s usual environment may be introduced using a recording. Family members can read to the patient from a favorite book and may suggest radio and television programs that the patient previously enjoyed as a means of enriching the environment and providing familiar input.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When arousing from coma, many patients experience a period of agitation, indicating that they are becoming more aware of their surroundings but still cannot react or communicate in an appropriate fashion. Although this is disturbing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1999" title="1999"></span>for many family members, it is actually a positive clinical sign. At this time, it is necessary to minimize stimulation by limiting background noises, having only one person speak to the patient at a time, giving the patient a longer period of time to respond, and allowing for frequent rest or quiet times. After the patient has regained consciousness, recordings of family or social events may assist the patient in recognizing family and friends and allow them to experience missed events.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Programs of sensory stimulation for patients with brain injury have been developed in an effort to improve outcomes. Although these are controversial programs with inconsistent results, some support the concept of providing structured neurostimulation (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">EETING THE</span> F<span class="small">AMILY&#x2019;S</span> N<span class="small">EEDS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The family of the patient with altered LOC may be thrown into a sudden state of crisis and go through the process of severe anxiety, denial, anger, remorse, grief, and reconciliation. Depending on the disorder that caused the altered LOC and the extent of the patient&#x2019;s recovery, the family may be unprepared for the changes in the cognitive and physical status of their loved one. If the patient has significant residual deficits, the family may require considerable time, assistance, and support to come to terms with these changes. To help family members mobilize resources and coping skills, the nurse reinforces and clarifies information about the patient&#x2019;s condition, encourages the family to be involved in care, and listens to and encourages sharing of feelings and concerns while supporting decision making about management and placement after hospitalization. Families may benefit from participation in support services offered through the hospital, rehabilitation facility, or community organizations.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The family may need to face the death of their loved one. The patient with a neurologic disorder is often pronounced brain dead before the heart stops beating. The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;brain death:&lt;/b&gt; irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem">brain death</button></strong> describes irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain and absence of brain stem reflexes (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Milliken &#x0026; Uveges, 2020</a>). The term may be misleading to the family because, although brain function has ceased, the patient appears to be alive, with the heart rate and blood pressure sustained by vasoactive medications and breathing continued by mechanical ventilation. When discussing a patient who is brain dead with family members, it is important to provide accurate, timely, understandable, and consistent information. See <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for discussion of end-of-life care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ONITORING AND</span> M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> P<span class="small">OTENTIAL</span> C<span class="small">OMPLICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Pneumonia, aspiration, and respiratory failure are potential complications in any patient who has a depressed LOC and who cannot protect the airway or turn, cough, and take deep breaths. The longer the period of unconsciousness, the greater the risk of pulmonary complications.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Vital signs and respiratory function are monitored closely to detect any signs of respiratory failure or distress. Complete blood count and arterial blood gas measurements are assessed to determine whether there are adequate red blood cells to carry oxygen and whether ventilation is effective. Chest physiotherapy and suctioning are initiated to prevent respiratory complications such as pneumonia. Oral care interventions are performed for patients receiving mechanical ventilation to maintain oral health and decrease the incidence of pneumonia (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Malhan et al., 2019</a>). If pneumonia develops, cultures are obtained to identify the organism so that appropriate antibiotic agents can be given.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with altered LOC is monitored closely for evidence of impaired skin integrity, and strategies to prevent skin breakdown and pressure injuries are continued through all phases of care, including hospitalization, rehabilitation, and home care. Factors that contribute to impaired skin integrity (e.g., incontinence, inadequate dietary intake, pressure on bony prominences, edema) are addressed. If pressure injuries develop, strategies to promote healing are undertaken. Care is taken to prevent bacterial contamination of pressure injuries, which may lead to sepsis and septic shock. See <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a> for assessment and management of pressure injuries.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of VTE, which may manifest as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin, danaparoid) as well as anti-embolism stockings or pneumatic compression devices are prescribed according to the patient&#x2019;s risk factors for thrombosis and bleeding (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4314">Galan, Egea-Guerrero, Diaz, et al., 2016</a>). The nurse observes for signs and symptoms of DVT or PE.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients with a prolonged decrease in LOC are at risk for developing contractures. During acute care, the patient is turned every 2 hours and passive range of motion performed at least twice a day. Splints, provided by occupational therapy, are applied to the hands and feet in a rotating manner to maintain functional joint alignment. Hand splints have been reported to be safe and beneficial for patients in decreasing spasticity and improving hand opening (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4322">Khan, Amatya, Bensmail, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
