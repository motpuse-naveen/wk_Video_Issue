<p class="nonindent">An ischemic stroke, formerly referred to as a cerebrovascular accident or &#x201C;brain attack,&#x201D; is a sudden loss of function resulting from disruption of the blood supply to a part of the brain. The term <em>brain attack</em> has been used to suggest to health care practitioners and the public that a stroke is an urgent health care issue similar to a heart attack. The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved thrombolytic therapy has a treatment window of 3 hours after the onset of a stroke, and scientific statements have endorsed its expanded use for up to 4.5 hours (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4358">Del Zoppo, Saver, Jauch, et al., 2009</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4368">Powers, Rabinstein, Ackerson, et al., 2019</a>). Although the time frame for treatment has expanded, urgency is needed on the part of the public and health care practitioners for rapid transport of the patient to a hospital for assessment and administration of the medication.</p>
<p class="indent">Ischemic strokes are subdivided into five different types based on the cause: large artery thrombotic strokes (20%), small penetrating artery thrombotic strokes (25%), cardiogenic embolic strokes (20%), cryptogenic strokes (30%), and others (5%) (see <a href="c62.xhtml#tt62-1">Table 62-1</a>). Large artery thrombotic strokes are caused by atherosclerotic plaques in the large blood vessels of the brain. Thrombus formation and occlusion at the site of the atherosclerosis result in ischemia and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;infarction:&lt;/b&gt; tissue necrosis in an area deprived of blood supply">infarction</button></strong> (tissue necrosis in an area deprived of blood supply) (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Small penetrating artery thrombotic strokes affect one or more vessels and are a common type of ischemic stroke. Small artery thrombotic strokes are also called <em>lacunar strokes</em> because of the cavity that is created after the death of infarcted brain tissue (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiogenic embolic strokes are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, usually atrial fibrillation. Embolic strokes can also be associated with valvular heart disease and thrombi in the left ventricle. Emboli originate from the heart and circulate to the cerebral vasculature, most commonly the left middle cerebral artery, resulting in a stroke. Embolic strokes may be prevented by the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p class="indent">The last two classifications of ischemic strokes are cryptogenic strokes, which have no known cause, and strokes from other causes, such as illicit drug use (cocaine), coagulopathies, migraine/vasospasm, or spontaneous dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2984"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtv1.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a community-acquired coronavirus whose primary pathologic evolution occurs within the respiratory system; however, due to abnormal blood clotting, one of the manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be ischemic stroke (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4378">Wadman, Couzin-Frankel, Kaiser, et al., 2020</a>). The increase in blood clots in patients with COVID-19 is associated with laboratory findings of high D-dimer levels (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Wadman et al., 2020</a>). Case reports of patients who have had strokes and COVID-19 reveal that many are younger than 50 years of age and that the strokes occur in the large blood vessels of the brain, resulting in severe neurologic deficits (see later discussion) (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4367">Oxley, Mocco, Majidi, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2985">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In an ischemic brain attack, there is disruption of the cerebral blood flow due to obstruction of a blood vessel. This disruption in blood flow initiates a complex series of cellular metabolic events referred to as the ischemic cascade (see Fig.&#x00A0;62-1).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff62-1">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff62-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff62-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;62-1 &#x2022;</span> Some of the processes contributing to ischemic brain cell injury.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2032</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2033" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2033">p. 2033</span></div>
<p class="indent">The ischemic cascade begins when cerebral blood flow decreases to less than 25 mL per 100 g of blood per minute. At this point, neurons are no longer able to maintain aerobic respiration. The mitochondria must then switch to anaerobic respiration, which generates large amounts of lactic acid, causing a change in the pH. This switch to the less efficient anaerobic respiration also renders the neuron incapable of producing sufficient quantities of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel the depolarization processes. The membrane pumps that maintain electrolyte balance begin to fail, and the cells cease to function.</p>
<p class="indent">Early in the cascade, an area of low cerebral blood flow, referred to as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;penumbra region:&lt;/b&gt; area of low cerebral blood flow">penumbra region</button></strong>, exists around the area of infarction. The penumbra region is ischemic brain tissue that may be salvaged with timely intervention. The ischemic cascade threatens cells in the penumbra because membrane depolarization of the cell wall leads to an increase in intracellular calcium and the release of glutamate. The influx of calcium and the release of glutamate, if continued, activate a number of damaging pathways that result in the destruction of the cell membrane, the release of more calcium and glutamate, vasoconstriction, and the generation of free radicals. These processes enlarge the area of infarction into the penumbra, extending the stroke. A person experiencing a stroke typically loses 1.9 million neurons each minute that a stroke is not treated, and the ischemic brain ages 3.6 years each hour without treatment (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4370">Saver, 2006</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Each step in the ischemic cascade represents an opportunity for intervention to limit the extent of secondary brain damage caused by a stroke. The penumbra area may be revitalized by administration of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Medications that protect the brain from secondary injury are called <em>neuroprotectants.</em> A number of clinical trials have focused on neuroprotective medications and strategies to improve stroke recovery and survival; so far, none have shown positive results (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2986">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An ischemic stroke can cause a wide variety of neurologic deficits, depending on the location of the lesion (which blood vessels are obstructed), the size of the area of inadequate perfusion, and the amount of collateral (secondary or accessory) blood flow. See <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a> for discussion of anatomy and brain blood supply. The patient may present with any of the following signs or symptoms:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Confusion or change in mental status</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Trouble speaking or understanding speech</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Visual disturbances</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Difficulty walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Sudden severe headache</p>
<p class="indent">Motor, sensory, cranial nerve, cognitive, and other functions may be disrupted. <a href="#tt62-2">Table 62-2</a> reviews the neurologic deficits frequently seen in patients with stroke. <a href="#tt62-3">Table 62-3</a> compares the symptoms and behaviors seen in right hemispheric stroke with those seen in left hemispheric stroke.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Motor Loss</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A stroke is an upper motor neuron lesion and results in loss of voluntary control over motor movements. Because the upper motor neurons decussate (cross), a disturbance of voluntary motor control on one side of the body may reflect damage to the upper motor neurons on the opposite side of the brain. The most common motor dysfunction is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemiplegia:&lt;/b&gt; paralysis of one side of the body, or part of it, due to an injury in the motor area of the brain">hemiplegia</button></strong> (paralysis of one side of the body, or part of it) caused by a lesion of the opposite side of the brain. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemiparesis:&lt;/b&gt; weakness of one side of the body, or part of it, due to an injury in the motor area of the brain">Hemiparesis</button></strong>, or weakness of one side of the body, or part of it, is another sign. The concept of upper and lower motor neuron lesions is described in more detail in <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>, <a href="c60-sec01.xhtml#tt60-4">Table 60-4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early stage of stroke, the initial clinical features may be flaccid paralysis and loss of or decrease in the deep tendon reflexes. When these deep reflexes reappear (usually by 48 hours), increased tone is observed along with spasticity (abnormal increase in muscle tone) of the extremities on the affected side.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Communication Loss</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Other brain functions affected by stroke are language and communication. In fact, stroke is the most common cause of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aphasia:&lt;/b&gt; inability to express oneself or to understand language">aphasia</button></strong> (inability to express oneself or to understand language). The following are dysfunctions of language and communication:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysarthria:&lt;/b&gt; defects of articulation due to neurologic causes">Dysarthria</button></strong> (difficulty in speaking) or dysphasia (impaired speech), caused by paralysis of the muscles responsible for producing speech</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Aphasia, which can be <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;expressive aphasia:&lt;/b&gt; inability to express oneself; often associated with damage to the left frontal lobe area">expressive aphasia</button></strong> (inability to express oneself), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;receptive aphasia:&lt;/b&gt; inability to understand what someone else is saying; often associated with damage to the temporal lobe area">receptive aphasia</button></strong> (inability to understand language), or global (mixed) aphasia (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>, <a href="c60-sec02.xhtml#tt60-5">Table 60-5</a>)</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apraxia:&lt;/b&gt; inability to perform previously learned purposeful motor acts on a voluntary basis">Apraxia</button></strong> (inability to perform a previously learned action), as may be seen when a patient makes verbal substitutions for desired syllables or words</p>
<h6 class="h6">Perceptual Disturbances</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Perception is the ability to interpret sensation. Stroke can result in visual&#x2013;perceptual dysfunctions, disturbances in visual&#x2013;spatial relations, and sensory loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Visual&#x2013;perceptual dysfunctions are caused by disturbances of the primary sensory pathways between the eye and visual cortex. Homonymous <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemianopsia:&lt;/b&gt; blindness of half of the field of vision in one or both eyes">hemianopsia</button></strong> (blindness in half of the visual field in one or both eyes) may occur from stroke and may be temporary or permanent. The affected side of vision corresponds to the paralyzed side of the body.</p>
<p class="indent">Disturbances in visual&#x2013;spatial relations (perceiving the relationship of two or more objects in spatial areas) are frequently seen in patients with right hemispheric damage.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sensory Loss</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sensory losses from stroke may be mild, such as a slight impairment of touch, or more severe, with loss of proprioception (ability to perceive the position and motion of body parts) as well as difficulty in interpreting visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli. An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;agnosia:&lt;/b&gt; loss of ability to recognize objects through a particular sensory system; may be visual, auditory, or tactile">agnosia</button></strong> is the loss of the ability to recognize objects through a particular sensory system; it may be visual, auditory, or tactile (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>, <a href="c60-sec02.xhtml#tt60-6">Table 60-6</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cognitive Impairment and Psychological Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If damage has occurred to the frontal lobe, learning capacity, memory, or other higher cortical intellectual functions may be impaired. Such dysfunction may be reflected in a limited attention span, difficulties in comprehension, forgetfulness, and a lack of motivation. These changes can cause the patient to become easily frustrated during rehabilitation. Depression is common and may be exaggerated by the patient&#x2019;s natural response to this catastrophic event. Emotional lability, hostility, frustration, resentment, lack of cooperation, and other psychological problems may occur.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2987">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Any patient with neurologic deficits needs a careful history eliciting the last time the patient was seen well and a rapid focused physical and neurologic examination. Initial assessment focuses on airway patency, which may be compromised by loss of gag or cough reflexes and altered respiratory pattern; cardiovascular status (including blood pressure, cardiac rhythm and rate, carotid bruit); and gross neurologic deficits.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may present to the acute care facility with temporary neurologic symptoms. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a neurologic deficit that completely resolves in 24 hours (most last less than 1 hour). A TIA is manifested by a sudden loss of motor, sensory, or visual function. The symptoms result from temporary ischemia (impairment of blood flow) to a specific region of the brain; however, when brain imaging is performed, there is no evidence of ischemia. A TIA may serve as a warning of impending stroke. Approximately 3% to 15% of all strokes are preceded by a TIA and occur within the first 90 days after the TIA (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4361">Johnston, Easton, Farrant, et al., 2018</a>). Lack of evaluation and treatment of a patient who has experienced previous TIAs may result in a stroke and irreversible deficits.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial diagnostic test for a stroke is a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan. This should be initiated within 20 minutes from the time the patient presents to the emergency department (ED) to determine if the event is ischemic or hemorrhagic, as the type of stroke determines treatment (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). Some cities now have mobile stroke units (an ambulance with a CT scanner) that can rapidly make this important distinction and can begin acute medical management. Further diagnostic workup for ischemic stroke involves attempting to identify the source of the thrombi or emboli and to determine if the patient would benefit from mechanical intervention (clot removal). Studies may include CT angiography or CT perfusion; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck vessels; transcranial Doppler flow studies; and transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and a carotid ultrasound are other standard tests.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2988">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary prevention of ischemic stroke remains the best approach. A healthy lifestyle including not smoking, engaging in physical activity (at least 40 minutes a day, 3 to 4 days a week), maintaining a healthy weight, and following a healthy diet (including modest alcohol consumption), can reduce the risk of having a stroke (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Virani et al., 2020</a>). Specific diets that have decreased risk of stroke include the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (high in fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein), the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with nuts), and overall diets that are rich in fruits and vegetables. Research findings suggest that low-dose aspirin may lower the risk of a first stroke for those who are at risk (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4364">Meschia, Bushnell, Boden-Albala, et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Stroke risk screenings are an ideal opportunity to lower stroke risk by identifying people or groups of people who are at high risk for stroke and by educating patients and the community about recognition and prevention of stroke. Stroke screenings are usually coordinated and run by nurses. Age, gender, and race are well-known nonmodifiable risk factors for stroke. High-risk groups include people older than 55 years, and the incidence of stroke more than doubles in each successive decade. Men have a higher age-adjusted rate of stroke than that of women in younger and middle age, but that difference narrows in the oldest age groups, in which the rate in women is almost equal to or sometimes even higher than in men. Each year, 55,000 more women than men have a stroke. Compared to Caucasian Americans, African Americans and some Hispanic/Latino Americans have a higher incidence of stroke and higher mortality (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Virani et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are many risk factors for ischemic stroke (see Chart&#x00A0;62-1). For people who are at high risk, interventions that alter modifiable factors, such as treating hypertension and stopping smoking, reduce stroke risk (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Meschia et al., 2014</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Additional treatable conditions that increase risk of stroke include sickle cell diseases, cardiomyopathy (ischemic and nonischemic), and valvular heart disease (e.g., endocarditis, prosthetic heart valves). Lesser known and potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke are migraine (especially migraine with aura), sleep apnea, and inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states. Chronic inflammatory conditions that have been associated with an increased risk of stroke are systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Several methods of preventing recurrent stroke have been identified for patients with TIAs or ischemic stroke. Patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis are treated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty and stenting. In patients with atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of emboli, administration of an anticoagulant that inhibits clot formation may prevent both thrombotic and embolic strokes (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4362">Kernan, Ovbiagele, Black, et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2989">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who have experienced a TIA or stroke should have medical management for secondary prevention. Those with atrial fibrillation (or cardioembolic strokes) are treated with dose-adjusted warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3. Other anticoagulants that may be prescribed as alternative drugs include dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, unless they are contraindicated. These drugs are also known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). If anticoagulants are contraindicated, aspirin alone is the best option, although the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin is also a reasonable therapy (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Kernan et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Platelet-inhibiting medications, including aspirin, extended-release dipyridamole plus aspirin, and clopidogrel decrease the incidence of cerebral infarction in patients who have experienced TIAs and stroke from suspected embolic or thrombotic causes. The specific medication that is used is based on the patient&#x2019;s health history. If the patient has had a minor ischemic stroke or what is considered a TIA with a high risk of having stroke, and they did not receive thrombolytic therapy, they may receive two platelet-inhibiting medications (dual antiplatelet therapy). Typically this is clopidogrel and aspirin, and can be taken for a period of 21 to 90 days after the stroke or TIA (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Research suggests that medications known as statins reduce coronary events and ischemic strokes. The most current stroke prevention guideline now includes the recommendation of a statin even if the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is below 100 mg/dL and there is no evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart disease and peripheral arterial disease) (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Kernan et al., 2014</a>). The FDA has included indications for statin medications, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, to include secondary stroke prevention.</p>
<p class="indent">After the acute stroke period, antihypertensive medications are also used, if indicated, for secondary stroke prevention. Preferred drugs include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics, or a combination of both (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Kernan et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Medical management of acute ischemic stroke needs to include consideration for endovascular treatment (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). The FDA has approved several devices that open the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the brain. These devices are used by specialists in the endovascular suite.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Thrombolytic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Thrombolytic agents are used to treat ischemic stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Recombinant t-PA is a genetically engineered form of t-PA (a thrombolytic substance made naturally by the body) (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). It works by binding to fibrin and converting plasminogen to plasmin, which stimulates fibrinolysis of the clot. Rapid diagnosis of stroke and initiation of thrombolytic therapy (within 3 hours) in patients with ischemic stroke leads to a decrease in the size of the stroke and an overall improvement in functional outcome after 3 months (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4365">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], 1995</a>). The goal is for intravenous (IV) t-PA to be given within 45 minutes of the patient arriving to the ED (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Mechanical intervention (e.g., mechanical thrombectomy, endovascular thrombectomy, intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy) can be used with t-PA or as an alternative to IV administration (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Amatangelo &#x0026; Thomas, 2019</a>). Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy allows for higher concentrations of the drug to be given directly to the clot, and the time window for treatment may be extended up to 24 hours in patients that meet specific criteria (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). Those not eligible for IV delivery may be eligible for intra-arterial delivery, and these methods may also be combined. Treatment using intra-arterial delivery must occur in specialized centers with access to emergent cerebral angiogram and interventional operating rooms/suites (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). Ongoing clinical trials continue to investigate the efficacy of other thrombolytic agents.</p>
<p class="indent">To realize the full potential of early intervention, community education directed at recognizing the symptoms of stroke and obtaining appropriate emergency care is necessary to ensure rapid transport to a hospital and initiation of therapy within the recommended 3-hour period (which may be extended up to 4.5 hours) (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4358">Del Zoppo et al., 2009</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). Delays make the patient ineligible for therapies, because revascularization of necrotic tissue (which develops after 3 hours) increases the risk of cerebral edema and hemorrhage.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endovascular Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">It is now recommended that patients with acute ischemic stroke receive endovascular therapy and medical management with a stent retriever if they meet specific criteria (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). All of the following criteria need to be met:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Prestroke status of no deficits</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Acute ischemic stroke receiving IV t-PA within 4.5 hours of onset according to guidelines from professional medical societies</p>

<p class="indent">Patients eligible for t-PA should receive IV t-PA even if endovascular treatments are being considered (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). Thrombolytic therapy should not be delayed.</p>
<p class="h7">Enhancing Prompt Diagnosis</p>
<p class="nonindent">After being notified by emergency medical service personnel, the ED contacts the appropriate staff (neurologist, neuroradiologist, radiology department, nursing staff, ECG, and laboratory technicians) and informs them of the patient&#x2019;s imminent arrival at the hospital. Many institutions have acute stroke teams that respond rapidly, ensuring that treatment occurs within the allotted period. This may be called a Code Stroke.</p>
<p class="indent">Initial management requires the definitive diagnosis of an ischemic stroke by brain imaging and a careful history to determine whether the patient meets the criteria for t-PA therapy (see <a href="#ct62-2">Chart 62-2</a>). The goal is that diagnostic results from imaging are completed within 25 minutes of the patient&#x2019;s arrival to the ED. Some of the contraindications for thrombolytic therapy include symptom onset greater than 3&#x00A0;hours before admission (expanded to 4.5 hours), a patient who is anticoagulated (with an INR above 1.7), or a patient who has recently had any type of significant intracranial pathology (e.g., previous stroke, head injury, trauma) in the last 3 months.</p>
<p class="indent">Before receiving t-PA, the patient is assessed using the NIHSS, a standardized assessment tool that helps evaluate stroke severity (see <a href="#tt62-4">Table 62-4</a>). Total NIHSS scores range from 0 (normal) to 42 (severe stroke). Certification in the administration of the scale is recommended and is available for nurses and other health care professionals.</p>

There are more stringent t-PA administration guidelines for patients with stroke symptoms that began 3 to 4.5 hours ago and also for those whose symptoms began longer than 4.5&#x00A0;hours ago or for whom time of onset is unclear, coupled with specific MRI findings. Specific guidance also exists for patients taking thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Dosage and Administration</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is weighed to determine the dose of t-PA. Typically, two or more IV sites are established prior to administration of t-PA (one for the t-PA and the other for administration of IV fluids). The dosage for t-PA is 0.9&#x00A0;mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 90 mg. Ten percent of the calculated dose is given as an IV bolus over 1 minute. The remaining dose (90%) is given IV over 1 hour via an infusion pump (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit or an acute stroke unit, where continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent neurologic assessments are conducted (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Amatangelo &#x0026; Thomas, 2019</a>). Vital signs are obtained frequently, with particular attention to blood pressure (with the goal of lowering the risk of intracranial hemorrhage) and temperature. An example of a standard protocol would be to obtain vital signs every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours, then every hour until 24 hours after treatment. Blood pressure should be maintained with the systolic pressure less than 185 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure less than 110 mm Hg (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>). Fever needs to be treated. Airway management is instituted based on the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition and arterial blood gas values.</p>
<p class="h7">Side Effects</p>
<p class="nonindent">Once it is determined that the patient is a candidate for t-PA therapy, no anticoagulant or platelet inhibiting medications (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) are given for the next 24 hours. Bleeding is the most common side effect of t-PA administration, and the patient is closely monitored for any bleeding (IV insertion sites, urinary catheter site, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, urine, stool, emesis, other secretions). A 24-hour delay in placement of nasogastric tubes, urinary catheters, and intra-arterial pressure catheters is recommended. Intracranial bleeding is a major complication that occurred in approximately 6.4% of patients in the initial t-PA study (NINDS, 1995). A number of factors are associated with the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial bleeding: age greater than 70 years, baseline NIHSS score greater than 20, serum glucose concentration 300 mg/dL or higher, and edema or mass effect observed on the patient&#x2019;s initial CT scan (NINDS, 1995).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Therapy for Patients with Ischemic Stroke Not Receiving Tissue Plasminogen Activator</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Not all patients are candidates for t-PA therapy. In some centers, other treatments may include anticoagulant administration (IV heparin or low&#x2013;molecular-weight heparin). Because of the risks associated with urgent anticoagulation, their general use is not recommended for patients with acute ischemic stroke (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Careful maintenance of cerebral hemodynamics to maintain cerebral perfusion is extremely important after a stroke. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) from brain edema and associated complications may occur after a large ischemic stroke. Interventions during this period include measures to reduce ICP, such as administering an osmotic diuretic (e.g., mannitol) to those that are declining clinically. Other treatment measures include the following (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>):</p>

<h6 class="h6">Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adequate cerebral blood flow is essential for cerebral oxygenation. If cerebral blood flow is inadequate, the amount of oxygen supplied to the brain will decrease, and tissue ischemia will result. Adequate oxygenation begins with pulmonary care, maintenance of a patent airway, and administration of supplemental oxygen as needed. The importance of adequate gas exchange in these patients cannot be overemphasized, because many patients are at risk for aspiration pneumonia.</p>
<p class="indent">Other potential complications after a stroke include urinary tract infections, cardiac arrhythmias (ventricular ectopy, tachycardia, and heart blocks), and complications of immobility. Hyperglycemia has been associated with poor neurologic outcomes in acute stroke; therefore, blood glucose levels are monitored and hypoglycemia avoided as well (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Prevention of Ischemic Stroke</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One surgical procedure for select patients with TIAs and mild stroke is CEA. A CEA is the removal of an atherosclerotic plaque or thrombus from the carotid artery to prevent stroke in patients with occlusive disease of the extracranial cerebral arteries (see <a href="#ff62-2">Fig. 62-2</a>). This surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms of TIA or mild stroke (or those without symptoms) who are found to have severe (70% to 99%) carotid artery stenosis or moderate (50% to 69%) stenosis with other significant risk factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Carotid artery stenting (CAS), with or without angioplasty, is a less invasive procedure that is used for treatment of carotid stenosis. This procedure has less discomfort for the patient and a shorter recovery time than CEA. Age can be considered when deciding which procedure will be best for the patient. For patients older than 70 years, CEA demonstrated improved outcomes in research studies; for those who were younger, outcomes between CAS and CEA were similar when comparing procedure complications (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Kernan et al., 2014</a>).</p>

<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon17a.png" alt=""/> Nursing Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">The main complications of CEA are stroke, cranial nerve injuries, infection or hematoma at the incision, and carotid artery disruption. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure levels in the immediate postoperative period. Blood pressure instability is common, and lasts 12 to 24 hours after the procedure (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Hypotension is avoided to prevent cerebral ischemia and thrombosis. Uncontrolled hypertension may precipitate cerebral hemorrhage, edema, hemorrhage at the surgical incision, or disruption of the arterial reconstruction. Medications are used to reduce the blood pressure to previous levels. Close cardiac monitoring is necessary, because these patients frequently have concomitant coronary artery disease.</p>
<p class="indent">After CEA, a neurologic observation record (see Chapter&#x00A0;61, <a href="c61-sec02.xhtml#ff61-6">Fig. 61-6</a>) is used to monitor and document assessment parameters for all body systems, with particular attention to neurologic status. The primary provider is notified immediately if a neurologic deficit develops. Formation of a thrombus at the site of the endarterectomy is suspected if there is a sudden new onset of neurologic deficits, such as weakness on one side of the body. The patient should be prepared for repeat endarterectomy.</p>
<p class="indent">Difficulty in swallowing, hoarseness, or other signs of cranial nerve dysfunction must be assessed. Cranial nerve injury is the most common complication following CEA. The nurse focuses on assessment of the following cranial nerves: facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), spinal accessory (XI), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2040" title="2040"></span>and hypoglossal (XII). Some edema in the neck after surgery is expected; however, extensive edema and hematoma formation can obstruct the airway. Emergency airway supplies, including those needed for a tracheostomy, must be available (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4369">Rich, Treat-Jacobson, DeVeaux, et al., 2017</a>). <a href="#tt62-5">Table 62-5</a> provides more information about potential complications of carotid surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Management after carotid stenting also requires monitoring of neurologic status and evaluation for hematoma formation (at the catheterization site). Cardiac monitoring is necessary with assessment for bilateral pulses distal to the catheterization site. Typically, patients are discharged the day after stenting if there are no complications (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Rich et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The acute phase of an ischemic stroke may last 1 to 3 days, but ongoing monitoring of all body systems is essential as long as the patient requires care. The patient who has had a stroke is at risk for multiple complications, including deconditioning and other musculoskeletal problems, swallowing difficulties, bowel and bladder dysfunction, inability to perform self-care, and skin breakdown.

It is also helpful for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the relative importance of predictors of stroke outcome (age, NIHSS score, and level of consciousness at the time of admission) in order to provide survivors of stroke and their families with realistic goals (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Powers et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The major goals for the patient (and family) may include improved mobility, avoidance of shoulder pain, achievement of self-care, relief of discomfort, prevention of aspiration, continence of bowel and bladder, decreasing confusion, achieving a form of communication, maintaining skin integrity, restored family functioning, improved sexual function, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing care has a significant impact on the patient&#x2019;s recovery. Often, many body systems are impaired as a result of the stroke, and conscientious care and timely interventions can prevent debilitating complications. During and after the acute phase, nursing interventions focus on the whole person. In addition to providing physical care, the nurse encourages and fosters recovery by listening to the patient and asking questions to elicit the meaning of the stroke experience.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> M<span class="small">OBILITY AND</span> P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> J<span class="small">OINT</span> D<span class="small">EFORMITIES</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A patient with hemiplegia has unilateral paralysis (paralysis on one side). When control of the voluntary muscles is lost, the strong flexor muscles exert control over the extensors. The arm tends to adduct (adductor muscles are stronger than abductors) and rotate internally. The elbow and the wrist tend to flex, the affected leg tends to rotate externally at the hip joint and flex at the knee, and the foot at the ankle joint supinates and tends toward plantar flexion.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Correct positioning is important to prevent contractures; measures are used to relieve pressure, assist in maintaining good body alignment, and prevent compressive neuropathies, especially of the ulnar and peroneal nerves. Because flexor muscles are stronger than extensor muscles, a splint applied at night to the affected extremity may prevent flexion and maintain correct positioning during sleep.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Preventing Shoulder Adduction.</span> To prevent adduction of the affected shoulder while the patient is in bed, a pillow is placed in the axilla when there is limited external rotation; this keeps the arm away from the chest. A pillow is placed under the arm, and the arm is placed in a neutral (slightly flexed) position, with distal joints positioned higher than the more proximal joints (i.e., the elbow is positioned higher than the shoulder and the wrist higher than the elbow). This helps to prevent edema and the resultant joint fibrosis that will limit range of motion if the patient regains control of the arm (see <a href="#ff62-3">Fig. 62-3</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Positioning the Hand and Fingers.</span> The fingers are positioned so that they are barely flexed. The hand is placed in slight supination (palm faces upward), which is its most functional position. If the upper extremity is flaccid, a splint can be used to support the wrist and hand in a functional position. If the upper extremity is spastic, a hand roll is not used, because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2042" title="2042"></span>it stimulates the grasp reflex. In this instance, a dorsal wrist splint is useful in allowing the palm to be free of pressure. Every effort is made to prevent hand edema.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Spasticity, particularly in the hand, can be a disabling complication after stroke. Botulinum toxin type A injected intramuscularly into wrist and finger muscles has been shown to be effective in reducing this spasticity (although the effect is temporary, typically lasting 2 to 4 months). This treatment is also effective for treating lower limb spasticity (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4371">Sun, Chen, Fu, et al., 2019</a>). Other treatments for spasticity may include stretching, splinting (in select patients), and oral medications such as baclofen and tizanidine (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4372">Teasell, Salbach, Foley, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Changing Positions.</span> The patient&#x2019;s position should be changed every 2 hours. To place a patient in a lateral (side-lying) position, a pillow is placed between the legs before the patient is turned. To promote venous return and prevent edema, the upper thigh should not be acutely flexed. The patient may be turned from side to side, but if sensation is impaired, the amount of time spent on the affected side should be limited.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If possible, the patient is placed in a prone position for 15 to 30 minutes several times a day. A small pillow or a support is placed under the pelvis, extending from the level of the umbilicus to the upper third of the thigh (see <a href="#ff62-4">Fig. 62-4</a>). This position helps promote hyperextension of the hip joints, which is essential for normal gait and helps prevent knee and hip flexion contractures. The prone position also helps drain bronchial secretions and prevents contractural deformities of the shoulders and knees. During positioning, it is important to reduce pressure and change position frequently to prevent pressure injuries.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Establishing an Exercise Program.</span> The affected extremities are exercised passively and put through a full range of motion four or five times a day to maintain joint mobility, regain motor control, prevent contractures in the paralyzed extremity, prevent further deterioration of the neuromuscular system, and enhance circulation. Exercise is helpful in preventing venous stasis, which may predispose the patient to venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Repetition of an activity forms new pathways in the CNS and therefore encourages new patterns of motion. At first, the extremities are usually flaccid. If tightness occurs in any area, the range-of-motion exercises should be performed more frequently.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is observed for signs and symptoms that may indicate PE or excessive cardiac workload during exercise; these include shortness of breath, chest pain, cyanosis, and increasing pulse rate with exercise. Frequent short periods of exercise always are preferable to longer periods at infrequent intervals. Regularity in exercise is most important. Improvement in muscle strength and maintenance of range of motion can be achieved only through daily exercise.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff62-4">
<figure class="figure">

<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is encouraged and reminded to exercise the unaffected side at intervals throughout the day. It is helpful to develop a written schedule to remind the patient of the exercise activities. The nurse supervises and supports the patient during these activities. The patient can be instructed to put the unaffected leg under the affected one to assist in moving it when turning and exercising. Flexibility, strengthening, coordination, endurance, and balancing exercises prepare the patient for ambulation. Quadriceps muscle setting and gluteal setting exercises (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>, <a href="c37-sec05.xhtml#ct37-4">Chart 37-4</a>) are started early to improve the muscle strength needed for walking; these are performed at least five times daily for 10 minutes at a time.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Preparing for Ambulation.</span> As soon as possible, the patient is assisted out of bed and an active rehabilitation program is started. The patient is first educated to maintain balance while sitting and then to learn to balance while standing. If the patient has difficulty in achieving standing balance, a tilt table, which slowly brings the patient to an upright position, can be used. Tilt tables are especially helpful for patients who have been on bed rest for prolonged periods and have orthostatic blood pressure changes.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient needs a wheelchair, the folding type with hand brakes is the most practical because it allows the patient to manipulate the chair. The chair should be low enough to allow the patient to propel it with the uninvolved foot and narrow enough to permit it to be used at home. When the patient is transferred from the wheelchair, the brakes must be applied and locked on both sides of the chair.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is usually ready to walk as soon as standing balance is achieved. Parallel bars are useful in these first efforts. A chair or wheelchair should be readily available in case the patient suddenly becomes fatigued or feels dizzy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The training periods for ambulation should be short and frequent. As the patient gains strength and confidence, an adjustable cane can be used for support. In general, a three- or four-pronged cane provides a stable support in the early phases of rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> S<span class="small">HOULDER</span> P<span class="small">AIN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The incidence of shoulder pain after stroke can vary widely, but has been measured to be as high as 84% (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4380">Zhou, Li, Lu, et al., 2018</a>). That pain may prevent patients from learning new skills and affect their quality of life. Shoulder function is essential in achieving balance and performing transfers and self-care activities. Problems that can occur include rotator cuff disorders, spasticity of the shoulder muscles, painful shoulder, subluxation of the shoulder, and shoulder&#x2013;hand syndrome. Development of a condition known as central pain syndrome may also contribute to the development of shoulder pain after a stroke.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A flaccid shoulder joint may be overstretched by the use of excessive force in turning the patient or from overstrenuous arm and shoulder movement. To prevent shoulder pain, the nurse should never lift the patient by the flaccid shoulder or pull on the affected arm or shoulder. Overhead pulleys should also be avoided. If the arm is paralyzed, subluxation (incomplete dislocation) at the shoulder can occur as a result <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2043" title="2043"></span>of overstretching of the joint capsule and musculature by the force of gravity when the patient sits or stands in the early stages after a stroke. This results in severe pain. Shoulder&#x2013;hand syndrome (painful shoulder and generalized swelling of the hand) can cause a frozen shoulder and ultimately atrophy of subcutaneous tissues. When a shoulder becomes stiff, it is usually painful.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Many shoulder problems can be prevented by proper patient movement and positioning. The flaccid arm is positioned on a table or with pillows while the patient is seated. A sling maybe worn on the flaccid arm when the patient first becomes ambulatory, to prevent the paralyzed upper extremity from dangling without support. Range-of-motion exercises are important in preventing painful shoulder. Overstrenuous arm movements are avoided. The patient is instructed to interlace the fingers, place the palms together, and push the clasped hands slowly forward to bring the scapulae forward; the patient then raises both hands above the head. This is repeated throughout the day. The patient is instructed to flex the affected wrist at intervals and move all the joints of the affected fingers. The patient is encouraged to touch, stroke, rub, and look at both hands. Pushing the heel of the hand firmly down on a surface is useful. Elevation of the arm and hand is also important in preventing dependent edema of the hand. Patients with continuing pain after attempted movement and positioning may require the addition of analgesia to their treatment program. Other treatments may include injections to the shoulder joint with corticosteroid medications or botulinum toxin type A, shoulder taping/strapping, acupuncture, electrical stimulation, heat or ice, and soft tissue massage (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Teasell et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4374">Treister, Hatch, Cramer, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Medications are often helpful in the management of poststroke pain. The medications that are used include amitriptyline, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and pregabalin (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Teasell et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Treister et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">As soon as the patient can sit up, they are encouraged to participate in personal hygiene activities. The patient is helped to set realistic goals; if feasible, a new task is added daily. The first step is to carry out all self-care activities on the unaffected side. Such activities as combing the hair, brushing the teeth, shaving with an electric razor, bathing, and eating can be carried out with one hand and should be encouraged. Although the patient may feel awkward at first, these motor skills can be learned by repetition, and the unaffected side will become stronger with use. The nurse must be sure that the patient does not neglect the affected side. Assistive devices will help make up for some of the patient&#x2019;s deficits (see <a href="#ct62-3">Chart 62-3</a>). A small towel is easier to control while drying after bathing, and boxed paper tissues are easier to use than a roll of toilet tissue.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Return of functional ability is important to the patient recovering after a stroke. An early baseline assessment of functional ability with an instrument such as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM&#x2122;) is important in team planning and goal setting for the patient. The FIM&#x2122; is a widely used instrument in stroke rehabilitation and provides valuable information about motor, social, and cognitive function. The patient&#x2019;s morale may improve if ambulatory activities are carried out in street clothes. The family is instructed to bring in clothing that is preferably a size larger than that usually worn. Clothing fitted with front or side fasteners or Velcro closures is the most suitable. The patient has better balance if most of the dressing activities are carried out while seated.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Perceptual problems may make it difficult for the patient to dress without assistance because of an inability to match the clothing to the body parts. To assist the patient, the nurse can take steps to keep the environment organized and uncluttered, because the patient with a perceptual problem is easily distracted. The clothing is placed on the affected side in the order in which the garments are to be put on. The use of a large mirror while dressing promotes the patient&#x2019;s awareness of what they are putting on the affected side. The patient has to make many compensatory movements when dressing; these can produce fatigue and painful twisting of the intercostal muscles. Support and encouragement are provided to prevent the patient from becoming overly fatigued and discouraged. Even with intensive training, not all patients can achieve independence in dressing.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with a decreased field of vision should be approached on the side where visual perception is intact. All visual stimuli (e.g., clock, calendar, television) should be placed on this side. The patient can be educated to turn the head in the direction of the defective visual field to compensate for this loss. The nurse should make eye contact with the patient and draw their attention to the affected side by encouraging the patient to move the head. The nurse may also want to stand at a position that encourages the patient to move or turn to visualize who is in the room. Increasing the natural or artificial lighting in the room and providing eyeglasses are important aids to increasing vision.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with homonymous hemianopsia turns away from the affected side of the body and tends to neglect that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2044" title="2044"></span>side and the space on that side; this is known as amorphosynthesis. In such instances, the patient cannot see food on half of the tray, and only half of the room is visible. It is important for the nurse to constantly remind the patient of the other side of the body; to maintain alignment of the extremities; and, if possible, to place the extremities where the patient can see them.</p>

<p class="processppara">Stroke can result in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysphagia:&lt;/b&gt; difficulty swallowing">dysphagia</button></strong> (difficulty swallowing) due to impaired function of the mouth, tongue, palate, larynx, pharynx, or upper esophagus. Patients must be observed for paroxysms of coughing, food dribbling out of or pooling in one side of the mouth, food retained for long periods in the mouth, or nasal regurgitation when swallowing liquids. Swallowing difficulties place the patient at risk for aspiration, pneumonia, dehydration, and malnutrition.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A swallow assessment should be performed as soon as possible after the patient&#x2019;s arrival to the ED (preferably within 4 to 24 hours). This is done before allowing any oral intake. A speech therapist will evaluate the patient&#x2019;s swallowing ability, but an assessment may also be done by the nurse using a validated and reliable assessment tool (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4352">Stroke Foundation, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If swallowing function is partially impaired, it may return over time, or the patient may be educated in alternative swallowing techniques, advised to take smaller boluses of food, and educated about types of foods that are easier to swallow. The patient may be started on a thick liquid or pureed diet, because these foods are easier to swallow than thin liquids. Having the patient sit upright, preferably out of bed in a chair, and instructing them to tuck the chin toward the chest as they swallow will help prevent aspiration. The diet may be advanced as the patient becomes more proficient at swallowing. If the patient cannot resume oral intake, a gastrointestinal feeding tube is placed for ongoing tube feedings and medication administration.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Enteral tubes can be either nasogastric (placed in the stomach) or nasoenteral (placed in the duodenum) to reduce the risk of aspiration. Nursing responsibilities in feeding include elevating the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent aspiration, checking the position of the tube before feeding, ensuring that the cuff of the tracheostomy tube (if in place) is inflated, and giving the tube feeding slowly. The feeding tube is aspirated periodically to ensure that the feedings are passing through the gastrointestinal tract. Retained or residual feedings increase the risk of aspiration. Patients with retained feedings may benefit from the placement of a gastrostomy tube or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. In a patient with a feeding tube, the tube should be placed in the duodenum to reduce the risk of aspiration. For long-term feedings, a gastrostomy tube is preferred (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">After a stroke, the patient may have transient urinary incontinence due to confusion, inability to communicate needs, and inability to use the urinal or bedpan because of impaired motor and postural control. Occasionally after a stroke, the bladder becomes atonic, with impaired sensation in response to bladder filling. Sometimes, control of the external urinary sphincter is lost or diminished. During this period, intermittent catheterization with sterile technique is carried out. After muscle tone increases and deep tendon reflexes return, bladder tone increases and spasticity of the bladder may develop. Because the patient&#x2019;s sense of awareness is clouded, persistent urinary incontinence or urinary retention may be symptomatic of bilateral brain damage. The voiding pattern is analyzed, and the urinal or bedpan is offered on this pattern or schedule. The upright posture and standing position are helpful for male patients during this aspect of rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients may have problems with bowel control, particularly constipation. Unless contraindicated, a high-fiber diet and adequate fluid intake (2 to 3 L/day) should be provided, and a regular time (usually after breakfast) should be established for toileting.</p>

<p class="processppara">After a stroke, the patient may have problems with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional deficits related to brain damage. However, in many instances, a considerable degree of function can be recovered, because not all areas of the brain are equally damaged; some remain more intact and functional than others.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After assessment that delineates the patient&#x2019;s deficits, the neuropsychologist, in collaboration with the primary provider, psychiatrist, nurse, and other professionals, structures a training program using cognitive-perceptual retraining, visual imagery, reality orientation, and cueing procedures to compensate for losses. Specific techniques used maybe conventional, computer-assisted, or virtual reality based.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The role of the nurse is supportive. The nurse reviews the results of neuropsychological testing; observes the patient&#x2019;s performance and progress; gives positive feedback; and, most importantly, conveys an attitude of confidence and hope. Interventions capitalize on the patient&#x2019;s strengths and remaining abilities while attempting to improve performance of affected functions. Other interventions are similar to those for improving cognitive functioning after a head injury (see <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> C<span class="small">OMMUNICATION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Aphasia, which impairs the ability to express oneself and to understand what is being said, may become apparent in various ways. The cortical area that is responsible for integrating the myriad pathways required for the comprehension and formulation of language is called <em>Broca area.</em> It is located in a convolution adjoining the middle cerebral artery. This area is responsible for control of the combinations of muscular movements needed to speak each word. Broca area is so close to the left motor area that a disturbance in the motor area often affects the speech area. This is why so many patients who are paralyzed on the right side (due to damage or injury to the left side of the brain) cannot speak, whereas those paralyzed on the left side are less likely to have speech disturbances.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The speech therapist assesses the communication needs of the patient who has had a stroke, describes the precise deficit, and suggests the best overall method of communication. Most language intervention strategies can be tailored for the individual patient. The patient is expected to take an active part in establishing goals.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A person with aphasia may become depressed. The inability to talk on the telephone, text, answer a question, or participate in conversation often causes anger, frustration, fear of the future, and hopelessness. Nursing interventions include strategies to make the atmosphere conducive to communication. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2045" title="2045"></span>This includes being sensitive to the patient&#x2019;s reactions and needs and responding to them in an appropriate manner while always treating the patient as an adult. The nurse provides strong emotional support and understanding to allay anxiety and frustration.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A common pitfall is for the nurse or other health care team member to complete the thoughts or sentences of the patient. This should be avoided, because it causes the patient to become more frustrated at not being allowed to speak and may deter efforts to practice putting thoughts together and completing sentences. A consistent schedule, routines, and repetition help the patient to function despite significant deficits. A written copy of the daily schedule, a folder of personal information (birth date, address, names of relatives), checklists, and recorded lists help improve the patient&#x2019;s memory and concentration. The patient may also benefit from a communication board (electronic or written), which has pictures of common needs and phrases. The board may be translated into any language.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When talking with the patient, it is important for the nurse to gain the patient&#x2019;s attention, speak slowly, and keep the language of instruction consistent. One instruction is given at a time, and time is allowed for the patient to process what has been said. The use of gestures may enhance comprehension. Speaking is thinking out loud, and the emphasis is on thinking. Listening and sorting out incoming messages require mental effort; the patient must struggle against mental inertia and needs time to organize a response.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In working with the patient with aphasia, the nurse must remember to talk to the patient during care activities. This provides social contact for the patient. <a href="#ct62-4">Chart 62-4</a> describes points to keep in mind when communicating with the patient with aphasia.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient who has had a stroke may be at risk for skin and tissue breakdown because of altered sensation and inability to respond to pressure and discomfort by turning and moving. Preventing skin and tissue breakdown requires frequent assessment of the skin, with emphasis on bony areas and dependent parts of the body. During the acute phase, a specialty bed (e.g., low air-loss bed) may be used until the patient can move independently or assist in moving.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">A regular turning schedule (e.g., every 2 hours) is adhered to, even if pressure-relieving devices are used to prevent tissue and skin breakdown. When the patient is positioned or turned, care must be used to minimize shear and friction forces, which cause damage to tissues and predispose the skin to breakdown.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s skin must be kept clean and dry; gentle massage of healthy (nonreddened) skin and adequate nutrition are other factors that help to maintain skin and tissue integrity.</p>

<p class="processppara">Family members play an important role in the patient&#x2019;s recovery. Family members are encouraged to participate in counseling and to use support systems that will help with the emotional and physical stress of caring for the patient. Involving others in the patient&#x2019;s care and providing education about stress management techniques and methods for maintaining personal health also facilitate family coping.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The family may have difficulty accepting the patient&#x2019;s disability and may be unrealistic in their expectations. They are given information about the expected outcomes and are counseled to avoid doing activities that the patient is able to do. They are assured that their love and interest are part of the patient&#x2019;s therapy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The family needs to be informed that the rehabilitation of the patient with hemiplegia requires many months and that progress may be slow. The gains made by the patient in the hospital or rehabilitation unit must be maintained. All caregivers should approach the patient with a supportive and optimistic attitude, focusing on the patient&#x2019;s remaining abilities. The rehabilitation team, the medical and nursing team, the patient, and the family must all be involved in developing attainable goals for the patient at home.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Most relatives of patients with stroke handle the physical changes better than the emotional aspects of care. The family should be prepared to expect occasional episodes of emotional lability. The patient may laugh or cry easily or without cause (pseudobulbar affect) and may be irritable and demanding or depressed and confused. The nurse can explain to the family that the patient&#x2019;s laughter does not necessarily connote happiness, nor does crying reflect sadness, and that emotional lability usually improves with time.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Family-centered care involves seeing patients and family caregivers as a one unit. Nurses can assess caregivers&#x2019; strengths and ability to provide care. This assessment should be a continual process because needs change throughout the hospitalization period and rehabilitation stay. Providing information about community resources, respite care and adult day care, and mental health issues (for the patient who has had a stroke and for caregivers) will help with the transition to home.</p>

<p class="processppara">Sexual functioning can be profoundly altered by stroke. Although research in this area of stroke management is limited, it appears that patients who have had a stroke consider sexual function important, and many have sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction after stroke is multifactorial. There may be medical reasons for the dysfunction (neurologic and cognitive deficits, previous diseases, medications) as well as various psychosocial factors, including depression. A stroke is such a catastrophic illness that the patient experiences loss <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2046" title="2046"></span>of self-esteem and value as a sexual being. These psychosocial factors play an important role in determining sexual drive, activity, and satisfaction after a stroke.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nurses in the rehabilitation setting play a crucial role in beginning a dialogue between the patient and their partner about sexuality after a stroke. In-depth assessments to determine sexual history before and after the stroke should be followed by appropriate interventions. Interventions for the patient and partner focus on providing relevant information, education, reassurance, adjustment of medications, counseling regarding coping skills, suggestions for alternative sexual positions, and a means of sexual expression and satisfaction.</p>

<p class="processppara">Decreased cerebral blood flow due to increased ICP, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain, seizures, and pneumonia are potential complications in any patient who has had an ischemic stroke. The more severe the stroke (i.e., the higher the NIHSS), the greater the risk of complications.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During the acute phase of care, a neurologic flow sheet (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, <a href="c61-sec02.xhtml#ff61-6">Fig. 61-6</a>) is used to monitor and document assessment parameters. Changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration are important clinically because they suggest increased ICP and are reported immediately. If signs and symptoms of pneumonia develop, cultures are obtained to identify the organism so that appropriate antibiotic agents can be given.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patient and family education is a fundamental component of stroke recovery. The nurse provides education about stroke, its causes and prevention, and the rehabilitation process. In both acute care and rehabilitation facilities, the focus is on educating the patient to resume as much self-care as possible. This may entail using assistive devices or modifying the home environment to help the patient live with a disability.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">An occupational therapist may be helpful in assessing the home environment and recommending modifications to help the patient become more independent. For example, a shower is more convenient than a tub for the patient with hemiplegia because most patients do not gain sufficient strength to get up and down from a tub. Sitting on a stool of medium height with rubber suction tips allows the patient to wash with greater ease. A long-handled bath brush with a soap container is helpful to the patient who has only one functional hand. If a shower is not available, a stool may be placed in the tub and a portable shower hose attached to the faucet. Hand rails may be attached alongside the bathtub and the toilet. Other assistive devices include special utensils for eating, grooming, dressing, and writing (see <a href="#ct62-3">Chart 62-3</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A program of physical therapy can be beneficial, whether it takes place in the home or in an outpatient program. Constraint-induced movement therapy has been used in stroke rehabilitation and involves constraint of the less affected upper limb, and intensely training the more affected limb. Robotic-assisted therapy uses sensorimotor training of the upper limb. This method allows patients to train without the presence of a therapist. Other techniques may include using virtual reality and video game applications, functional/neuromuscular/transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and ambulation with body weight support and treadmill training to assist with recovery (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4375">Veteran&#x2019;s Administration/Department of Defense, The Management of Stroke Rehabilitation Work Group, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<span class="small">ONTINUING AND</span> T<span class="small">RANSITIONAL</span> C<span class="small">ARE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A variety of transitional care models are being used in patients with stroke. Some evidence supports positive outcomes using transitional care but more research and standardization of interventions is needed for confirmation. One model currently being investigated is a person-centered model. This model includes a telephone call at 2, 30, and 60 days after discharge. Calls are conducted either by a nurse or an advanced practice provider. Patients are also seen in the outpatient clinic within 2 weeks after discharge (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4354">Bushnell, Duncan, Lycan, et al., 2018</a>). Depending on the specific neurologic deficits resulting from the stroke, the patient at home may require the services of a number of health care professionals. The nurse often coordinates the care of the patient at home and considers the many educational needs of caregivers and patients. The family (often the spouse) requires education as well as assistance in planning and providing care.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The family is advised that the patient may tire easily, may become irritable and upset by small events, and may be less interested in events than expected. Emotional problems associated with stroke are often related to speech dysfunction and the frustrations of being unable to communicate. A speech therapist allows the family to be involved and gives the family practical instructions to help the patient between therapy sessions.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Depression is a common and serious problem (increases mortality) in the patient who has had a stroke. Approximately one third of patients who have had a stroke will suffer from depression (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Virani et al., 2020</a>). Risk factors include gender (more prevalent in women), a history of depression, cognitive or physical impairment, anxiety, aphasia and stroke severity (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4384">Villa, Ferrari, &#x0026; Moretti, 2018</a>). Because the length of hospital stays has shortened, depression may not be identified in the acute setting. Nurses in all care settings should identify patients who may be at risk for depression or who show depressive symptoms. In the home or in the rehabilitation setting, nurses may be involved in coordinating care and referring patients and family to appropriate resources. The family can help by continuing to support the patient and by giving positive reinforcement for the progress that is being made. Antidepressant therapy may be prescribed, and may help with recovery from stroke (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4359">Elzib, Pawloski, Ding, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Community-based stroke support groups may allow the patient and family to learn from others with similar problems and to share their experiences. Support groups take the form of in-person meetings as well as Internet-based support programs. The patient is encouraged to continue hobbies and recreational and leisure interests and to maintain contact with friends to prevent social isolation. All nurses coming in contact with the patient should encourage the patient to keep active, adhere to the exercise program, and remain as self-sufficient as possible.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Early Identification of Depression in Caregivers of Stroke Survivors</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Byun, E., Evans, L., Sommers, M., et al. (2019). Depressive symptoms in caregivers immediately after stroke. <em>Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation</em>, <em>26</em>(3), 187&#x2013;194.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In the early weeks post stroke, caregivers face many challenges and increased stress related to caring for a stroke survivor. Recognizing those caregivers most at risk for developing depression early after hospital discharge may lead to decreased symptoms and improved health and quality of life for caregivers. The long-term health of caregivers of stroke survivors is significant; poor health can impact their ability to serve in the capacity of caregiver. The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of caregivers and stroke survivors associated with caregiver depressive symptoms in the early weeks following a family member&#x2019;s stroke.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study used a prospective, longitudinal exploratory design. The participants were a convenience sample of 63 caregivers of older adult stroke survivors who had been diagnosed with a new or recurrent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within the past 2 weeks. They were recruited from urban acute care settings. Caregivers were enrolled in the study by 2 weeks post stroke (T1) and then revisited 4 weeks later (T2). Symptoms of depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale used as a screening tool for major and minor depression. Uncertainty, stress, coping capacity, social support, chronic illness, and sociodemographic information were measured. Perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale. Physiologic stress was measured by salivary cortisol levels measured upon waking and in the evening. The stroke survivor&#x2019;s functional status was measured using the Barthel Index, a 10-item scale measuring functional status. Sociodemographic information and clinical characteristics (severity of stroke, description of stroke, presence of communication disability, and days post stroke) of the stroke survivors were also collected.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study began with 63 caregivers enrolled. By the second time point evaluation (T2), 13 stroke survivors had died, 3 caregivers withdrew from the study, and 7 more were lost to follow-up. A total of 40 caregivers completed the second time point evaluation (T2). Ages of caregivers ranged from 30 to 89 years (mean 56.92 years). Ages of stroke survivors ranged from 65 to 95 years (mean 75.92 years). More than half (57%) of caregivers had at least mild depressive symptoms in the early weeks of caregiving. Six weeks after the stroke, 40% continued to have depressive symptoms. About 30% had at least moderate depressive symptoms at both time points (T1 and T2). Greater depressive symptoms were correlated with elevated salivary cortisol levels in the evening but not with levels upon waking. Characteristics associated with more depressive symptoms across the first 6 weeks post stroke included caregiver uncertainty, perceived stress, coping, social support, race, income, time spent in caregiving, and stroke survivor race and functional status.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study found that depressive symptoms in this sample of caregivers were common in the early weeks of caregiving. It is important for nurses to understand the caregiving experience and the risk in both patients and caregivers for developing depression. Clearly identifying characteristics that are associated with caregivers developing depression can help with earlier recognition of those at risk. If these caregivers receive appropriate interventions and additional support soon after hospital discharge, they may experience decreased depressive symptoms and improved quality of life. Nurses should be involved in the discharge process to home and can help caregivers adjust and be prepared for their new role and challenges.</p>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse should recognize the potential effects of caregiving on the family. Not all families have the adaptive coping skills and adequate psychological functioning necessary for the long-term care of another person. The patient&#x2019;s spouse may be older, with their own health concerns; in some instances, the patient may have been the provider of care to the spouse. A spouse may have to take on new roles and responsibilities in the relationship and around the home. Spouses may also feel a sense of loss (of freedom and leisure time as well as of the marital relationship) and may experience social isolation and financial burdens. Depression is common in caregivers of patients who have survived a stroke, with rates globally documented as approximately 40% (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4363">Loh, Tan, Zhang, et al., 2017</a>). Nurses should assess caregivers for signs and symptoms of depression (<a href="c62-sec02.xhtml#bib4355">Byun, Evans, Sommers, et al., 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct62-5">Chart 62-5</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Caregivers may require reminders to attend to their own health concerns and well-being. Even healthy caregivers may find it difficult to maintain a schedule that includes being available around the clock. The nurse encourages the family to arrange for respite care services (planned short-term care to relieve the family from having to provide continuous 24-hour care), which may be available from an adult day care center. Some hospitals also offer weekend respite care that can provide caregivers with needed time for themselves. The nurse involved in home and continuing care also needs to remind the patient and family of the need for respite care as well as continuing health promotion and screening practices.</p>
