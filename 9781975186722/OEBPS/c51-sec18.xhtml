<h4 class="h4" id="s2381">Benign Tumors of the Uterus: Fibroids (Leiomyomas, Myomas)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Most women will develop myomatous or <strong>fibroid tumors</strong> of the uterus at some point in their life. It is estimated that by the age of 50, up to 70% of White women and 80% of African American women will experience uterine fibroids (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3727">National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2018</a>). It is thought that women are genetically predisposed to develop this condition, which is almost always benign. Fibroids arise from the muscle tissue of the uterus and can be solitary or multiple, intracavitary (in the lining of the uterus), intramural (in the muscle wall), and serosal (in the outside surface). They usually develop slowly in women between 25 and 40 years of age and may become quite large. A growth spurt with enlargement of the fibroid tumor may occur in the decade before menopause, possibly related to anovulatory cycles and high levels of unopposed estrogen. Fibroids are a common reason for hysterectomy because they often result in menorrhagia, which can be difficult to control.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2382">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fibroids may cause no symptoms, or they may produce abnormal vaginal bleeding. Other symptoms result from pressure on the surrounding organs and include pain, backache, pressure, bloating, constipation, and urinary problems. Menorrhagia (excessive bleeding) and metrorrhagia (irregular bleeding) may occur because fibroids may distort the uterine lining (see <a href="#ff51-7">Fig.&#x00A0;51-7</a>). Fibroids may interfere with fertility.</p>

Those that impinge on the uterine cavity are called <em>intracavitary myomas.</em></p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2383">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of uterine fibroids may include medical or surgical intervention and depends to a large extent on the size, symptoms, and location, as well as the woman&#x2019;s age and her reproductive plans. Fibroids usually shrink and disappear during menopause, when estrogen is no longer produced. Simple observation and follow-up may be all the management that is necessary. The patient with minor symptoms is closely monitored. If she plans to have children, treatment is as conservative as possible. As a rule, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myomectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of uterine fibroids">myomectomy</button></strong> (surgical removal of uterine fibroids) is performed for large tumors that produce pressure symptoms. A hysterectomy may be performed if symptoms are severe and childbearing is completed (see later discussion of nursing care for a patient having a hysterectomy).</p>
<p class="indent">Several alternatives to hysterectomy have been developed for the treatment of excessive bleeding due to fibroids (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Fortin, Flyckt, &#x0026; Falcone, 2017</a>). These include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Hysteroscopic resection of myomas:</em> A laser is used through a hysteroscope passed through the cervix; no incision or overnight stay is needed.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Laparoscopic myomectomy:</em> Removal of a fibroid through a laparoscope inserted through a small abdominal incision.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Laparoscopic myolysis:</em> The use of a laser or electrical needles to cauterize and shrink the fibroid.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Laparoscopic cryomyolysis:</em> Electric current is used to coagulate the fibroid.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Uterine artery embolization (UAE):</em> Polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin particles are injected into the blood vessels that supply the fibroid via the femoral artery, resulting in infarction and resultant shrinkage. This percutaneous image-guided therapy offers an alternative to hormone therapy or surgery. UAE may result in infrequent but serious complications such as pain, infection, amenorrhea, necrosis, and bleeding. Although rare, deaths and ovarian failure may occur. Women need to weigh the risks and benefits carefully, especially if they have not completed childbearing.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Magnetic resonance&#x2013;guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS):</em> Ultrasonic energy is passed through the abdominal wall to target and destroy the fibroid. This noninvasive procedure is approved by the FDA for women who are premenopausal with bothersome symptoms due to fibroids and who do not want more children. It is an outpatient treatment.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Medications (e.g., leuprolide) or other gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, which induce a temporary menopause like environment, may be prescribed to shrink the fibroids. This treatment consists of monthly injections, which may cause hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Treatment is usually short term (i.e., before surgery) to shrink the fibroids, allowing easier surgery, and to alleviate anemia, which may occur as a result of heavy menstrual flow. This treatment is used on a temporary basis because it leads to vasomotor symptoms and loss of bone density.</p>
<p class="indent">Antifibrotic agents are under investigation for long-term treatment of fibroids. Mifepristone, a progesterone antagonist, is also utilized.</p>
