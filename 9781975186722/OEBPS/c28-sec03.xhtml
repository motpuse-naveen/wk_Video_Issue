<h4 class="h4" id="s1066">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Most hematologic diseases reflect a defect in the hematopoietic, hemostatic, or reticuloendothelial systems. The defect can be quantitative (e.g., increased or decreased production of cells), qualitative (e.g., the cells that are produced are defective in their expected functional capacity), or both. Initially, many hematologic conditions cause few symptoms, and extensive laboratory tests are often required to establish a diagnosis. For most hematologic conditions, continued monitoring via specific blood tests is required because it is very important to assess for changes in test results over time. In general, it is important to assess trends in test results because these trends help the clinician decide whether the patient is responding appropriately to interventions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1067">Hematologic Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common tests used are the complete blood count (CBC) and the peripheral blood smear. The CBC identifies the total number of blood cells (leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets) as well as the hemoglobin, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hematocrit:&lt;/b&gt; percentage of total blood volume consisting of RBCs">hematocrit</button></strong> (percentage of blood volume consisting of erythrocytes), and RBC indices. Because cellular morphology (shape and appearance of the cells) is particularly important in accurately diagnosing most hematologic disorders, the blood cells involved must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page893" title="893"></span>be examined. This process is referred to as the manual examination of the peripheral smear, which may be part of the CBC. In this test, a drop of blood is spread on a glass slide, stained, and examined under a microscope. The shape and size of the erythrocytes and platelets, as well as the actual appearance of the leukocytes, provide useful information in identifying hematologic conditions. Blood for the CBC is typically obtained by venipuncture (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Other common tests of coagulation are the prothrombin time (PT), typically replaced by the standardized test, international normalized ratio (INR), and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The INR and aPTT serve as useful screening tools for evaluating a patient&#x2019;s clotting ability and monitoring the therapeutic effectiveness of anticoagulant medications. In both tests, specific reagents are mixed into the plasma sample, and the time taken to form a clot is measured. For these tests to be accurate, the test tube must be filled with the correct amount of the patient&#x2019;s blood; either excess or inadequate blood volume within the tube can render the results inaccurate.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1068">Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are crucial when additional information is needed to assess how a patient&#x2019;s blood cells are being formed and to assess the quantity and quality of each type of cell produced within the marrow. Also, results of these tests can be used to document infection or tumor within the marrow. Other specialized tests can be performed on the marrow aspirate, such as cytogenetic analysis or immunophenotyping (i.e., identifying specific proteins expressed by cells), and are useful to identify certain malignant conditions and form a prognosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Normal bone marrow is in a semifluid state and can be aspirated through a special large needle. In adults, bone marrow is usually aspirated from the iliac crest and occasionally from the sternum. The bone marrow aspirate provides a sample of cells from the more fluid part of the bone marrow and may not be adequate for evaluating certain conditions, such as anemia. When more information is required, a bone marrow biopsy is performed, which examines a solid part of the bone marrow. Biopsy samples are taken from the posterior iliac crest; although occasionally, an anterior approach is required. A marrow biopsy shows the architecture of the bone marrow as well as its degree of cellularity.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient preparation includes a careful explanation of the procedure, which may be done at the patient&#x2019;s bedside (for a patient who is hospitalized) or in the outpatient setting. Some patients may be anxious, thus an anxiolytic agent may be prescribed. It is essential the physician or nurse explain the procedure, including risks, benefits and alternatives, and describe sensations the patient may experience. A signed informed consent is required for a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.</p>
<p class="indent">Before aspiration, the skin is cleansed using aseptic technique. Next, a small area is anesthetized with a local anesthetic agent through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the periosteum of the bone; it is not possible to anesthetize the bone itself. The bone marrow needle is introduced with a stylet in place. When the needle moves through the outer cortex of bone and enters the marrow cavity, the stylet is removed, and a syringe is attached. A small volume (5 mL) of blood and marrow is then aspirated. Patients typically feel a pressure sensation as the needle is advanced into position. The actual aspiration always causes sharp but brief pain, resulting from the suction exerted as the marrow is aspirated into the syringe. Taking deep breaths or using relaxation techniques often helps ease the discomfort (see <a href="#ff28-5">Fig. 28-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A bone marrow biopsy is most often performed with a bone marrow aspiration and is called a bone marrow exam (Mayo Clinic, 2018a). The bone marrow aspirate is used to determine types and numbers of cells present in the bone marrow. The bone marrow biopsy consists of an actual tissue sample used to study the architecture of the bone marrow and confirm diagnoses (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Wimberly, 2019</a>). For a bone marrow biopsy, a special biopsy needle is used. Because these needles are large, the skin may be punctured first with a surgical blade to make a 3- to 4-mm incision. The biopsy needle is advanced well into the marrow cavity. When the needle is properly positioned, a portion of marrow is cored out. The patient feels a pressure sensation but should not feel actual pain. The nurse should assist the patient in maintaining a comfortable position and encourage relaxation and deep breathing throughout the procedure. The patient should be instructed to inform the physician if pain occurs so that an additional anesthetic agent can be given.</p>
<p class="indent">Potential complications of either bone marrow aspiration or biopsy include bleeding and infection. The risk of bleeding is somewhat increased if the patient&#x2019;s platelet count is low or if the patient has been taking a medication that alters platelet function (e.g., aspirin). After the marrow sample is obtained, pressure is applied to the site for several minutes. The site is then covered with a sterile dressing. Most patients have no discomfort after a bone marrow aspiration, but the site of a biopsy may ache for 1 or 2 days. Warm tub baths and a mild analgesic agent (e.g., acetaminophen) may be useful. Aspirin-containing analgesic agents should be avoided in the immediate postprocedure period because they can aggravate or potentiate bleeding. Also, no rigorous activity or exercise for 1 to 2 days is recommended (Mayo Clinic, 2018a).</p>
