<h4 class="h4" id="s1208">Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">ALL results from an uncontrolled proliferation of immature cells (lymphoblasts) derived from the lymphoid stem cell. The cell of origin is the precursor to the B lymphocyte in approximately 75% of ALL cases; T-lymphocyte ALL occurs in approximately 25% of cases. The <em>BCR-ABL</em> translocation (see previous discussion in CML section) is found in 20% of ALL blast cells (NCCN, 2019c). ALL can occur at any age, but 75% to 80% of all cases are found in children, with the median age at diagnosis being 15 years (NCCN, 2019c). Boys are affected more often than girls; the peak incidence is 4 years of age. After 15 years of age, it is relatively uncommon, until age 45 when the incidence again rises (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018a). For those over age 45, risk factors for ALL include older age (especially over 70 years), prior exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, having certain genetic conditions (e.g., especially Down syndrome; also neurofibromatosis, Klinefelter syndrome, and Fanconi anemia) (NCCN, 2019c). In the last several decades, advances in understanding the pathophysiology and molecular genetics, as well as the incorporation of targeted therapy and HSCT, have resulted in improved cure rates and overall longer survival in patients with ALL.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1209">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For some patients with ALL, the clinical manifestations may be nonspecific while others have no symptoms initially. The disease is commonly found incidentally with routine laboratory studies or physical exam for another condition. At the time of diagnosis, the leukocyte counts may be either higher or lower than normal, with a high proportion of immature lymphoblasts. Immature lymphocytes proliferate in the marrow and impede the development of normal myeloid cells. As a result, normal hematopoiesis is inhibited, resulting in reduced numbers of granulocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Manifestations of leukemic cell infiltration into other organs are more common with ALL than with other forms of leukemia and include pain from an enlarged liver or spleen as well as bone pain. The central nervous system (CNS) is frequently <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page957" title="957"></span>a site for leukemic cells; thus, patients may exhibit cranial nerve palsies or headache and vomiting because of meningeal involvement. Other extranodal sites include the testes and breasts.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment is to obtain remission without excess toxicity and with a rapid hematologic recovery so that additional therapy can be given if needed. Because of the heterogeneity of the disease, treatment plans are based on genetic markers of the disease as well as risk factors of the patient, primarily age. Similar to treatment for AML, treatment for ALL can be grouped into induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases. Because ALL frequently invades the CNS, preventive intrathecal chemotherapy or, less frequently, cranial irradiation, are also a key part of the treatment plan (NCCN, 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment protocols for ALL tend to be complex, using a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents and complicated administration schedules. The expected outcome of treatment is complete remission. Despite its complexity, treatment can be provided in the outpatient setting in some circumstances until severe complications develop. TKIs (e.g., imatinib) are effective in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL; these drugs can be used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Lymphoid blast cells are typically very sensitive to corticosteroids and to vinca alkaloids; therefore, these medications are an integral part of the initial induction therapy (NCCN, 2019c). The corticosteroid dexamethasone is preferred to prednisone, as it is more toxic to lymphoid cells and has better CNS penetration. Typically, an anthracycline is included, sometimes with asparaginase. Once a patient is in remission, special testing (immunophenotyping, immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, T-cell receptor genes, molecular testing) is done to look for residual leukemic cells; these tests can detect as few as a single ALL cell among 10,000 to 100,000 normal cells. This minimal residual disease testing is useful as a prognostic indicator. Based on these results and the rapidity in which remission is achieved, a consolidation regimen ensues, using different combinations and dosages of the drugs used in induction therapy; the goal of consolidation is to improve outcomes in those patients at high risk for relapse. For patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL, agents such as blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin have been found to be effective (NCCN, 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with ALL can experience some unique adverse effects from treatment. The use of corticosteroids to treat ALL increases the patient&#x2019;s susceptibility to infection; viral infections are common. Avascular necrosis can occur in patients treated with corticosteroid-based chemotherapy, as well as with transplantation. Patients treated with asparaginase are at increased risk for thrombosis. Hepatic toxicity is also common and may necessitate cessation of supportive drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors and certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs.</p>
<p class="indent">Allogeneic HSCT may be considered during initial remission if disease features and testing suggest the risk of relapse is high (NCCN, 2019c; Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018a). The development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has significantly improved treatment outcomes and overall survival in patients with ALL (NCCN, 2019c). CAR-T therapy utilizes the patient&#x2019;s own immune system to fight disease; the patient&#x2019;s own T cells are collected, modified, and reinfused back into the patient. Treatment with CAR-T can serve as a bridge prior to transplant and has qualified patients for HSCT who were formerly ineligible. In the context of average-risk disease, HSCT may be postponed until the time of relapse, should it occur. HSCT can improve long-term disease-free survival; however, this potential benefit must be weighed with the risks associated with the procedure, including death and long-term morbid complications.</p>
