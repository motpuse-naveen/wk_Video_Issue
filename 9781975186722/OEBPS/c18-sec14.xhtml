<h4 class="h4" id="s612">Cancer of the Larynx</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer of the larynx accounts for approximately half of all head and neck cancers. The American Cancer Society (ACS, 2017) estimates that about 12,410 new cases and 3760 deaths occur annually, with a 5-year relative survival rate that ranges from 32% to 90%, depending on the location of the tumor and its stage at the time of diagnosis (ACS, 2017). Cancer of the larynx is most common in people older than 65 years and is four times more common in men (ACS, 2017) (<a href="#ct18-6">Chart&#x00A0;18-6</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Almost all malignant tumors of the larynx arise from the surface epithelium and are classified as squamous cell carcinoma. Approximately 55% of patients with laryngeal cancer present with involved lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis, with bilateral lesions present in 16% of patients (<a href="#bib1374">De Vita, Hellman, &#x0026; Rosenberg, 2018</a>). Recurrence occurs usually within the first 2 to 3 years after diagnosis. The presence of disease after 5 years is often secondary to a new primary malignancy. The incidence of distant metastasis with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (including larynx cancer) is relatively low.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s613">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hoarseness of more than 2 weeks&#x2019; duration occurs in the patient with cancer in the glottic area because the tumor impedes the action of the vocal cords during speech. The voice may sound harsh, raspy, and lower in pitch. Affected voice sounds are not always early signs of subglottic or supraglottic cancer, however. The patient may complain of a persistent cough or sore throat and pain and burning in the throat, especially when consuming hot liquids or citrus juices. A lump may be felt in the neck. Later symptoms include dysphagia, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), unilateral nasal obstruction or discharge, persistent hoarseness, persistent ulceration, and foul breath. Cervical lymph adenopathy, unintentional weight loss, a general debilitated state, and pain radiating to the ear may occur with metastasis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s614">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An initial assessment includes a complete history and physical examination of the head and neck. This includes identification of risk factors, family history, and any underlying medical conditions. An indirect laryngoscopy, using a flexible endoscope, is initially performed in the otolaryngologist&#x2019;s office to visually evaluate the pharynx, larynx, and possible tumor. Mobility of the vocal cords is assessed; if normal movement is limited, the growth may affect muscle, other tissue, and even the airway. The lymph nodes of the neck and the thyroid gland are palpated for enlargement.</p>
<p class="indent">Diagnostic procedures that may be used include fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, a barium swallow, endoscopy, CT or MRI scan, and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan (ACS, 2017). FNA biopsy may be done as an initial screening procedure to obtain samples of any enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A barium swallow may be done if the patient initially presents with a chief complaint of difficulty in swallowing, to outline any structural anomalies of the neck that could pinpoint a tumor. However, if a tumor of the larynx is suspected on an initial examination, a direct laryngoscopic examination is indicated. Laryngoscopy is performed under local or general anesthesia to evaluate all areas of the larynx. In some cases, intraoperative examination obtained by direct microscopic visualization and palpation of the vocal folds may yield a more accurate diagnosis. Samples of the suspicious tissue are obtained for analysis. It is uncommon that human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in laryngeal cancers, although it is frequently implicated in oropharyngeal and tonsillar cancers. Whether or not the tumor is positive for HPV does not have an effect on the course of treatment (ACS, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">The classification, including stage of the tumor (i.e., size and histology of the tumor, presence and extent of cervical lymph node involvement) and location of the tumor serve as a basis for treatment. CT scanning and MRI are used to assess regional adenopathy and soft tissues and to stage and determine the extent of a tumor. MRI is also helpful in posttreatment follow-up to detect a recurrence. PET scanning may also be used to detect recurrence of the laryngeal tumor after treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s615">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of treatment of laryngeal cancer include cure; preservation of safe, effective swallowing; preservation of useful voice; and avoidance of permanent tracheostoma (<a href="#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The prognosis depends on the tumor location (i.e., supraglottic, glottis, subglottic), as well as the tumor grade and stage (i.e., using the TNM system; see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec04.xhtml#ct12-3">Chart&#x00A0;12-3</a>). The treatment plan also depends on whether the cancer is an initial diagnosis or a recurrence. In addition, before treatment begins, a complete dental examination is performed to rule out any oral disease. A consultation with a dental oncologist may be warranted. Any dental problems are resolved, if possible, before surgery and radiotherapy (ACS, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with early-stage tumors (i.e., stages I and II) and lesions without lymph node involvement, external-beam radiation therapy or conservation surgery (i.e., less invasive surgery, such as vocal cord stripping or cordectomy) may be effective. Other indicated surgical procedures may include transoral endoscopic laser excision or partial <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;laryngectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of all or part of the larynx and surrounding structures">laryngectomy</button></strong> (i.e., in this instance, removal of part of the larynx) (<a href="#bib1408">National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2019</a>). Patients with stage III and IV tumors that are resectable may be advised to have either total laryngectomies with or without postoperative radiation therapy or radiation therapy with concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (with single-agent cisplatin) and surgical resection aimed at preserving some of the larynx (i.e., organ preservation surgery). Patients with late-stage tumors that extend through cartilage and into soft tissues are generally advised to have total laryngectomies with postoperative radiation therapy (NCI, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients should be educated so that they carefully consider the various side effects and complications associated with the different treatment modalities. The presence of lymph node involvement in the neck can affect the outcome. Supraglottic tumors metastasize early and bilaterally even when there appears to be no lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. When the neck lymph nodes are involved, the treatment includes surgery, chemoradiation, or both (<a href="#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The overall goals for the patient undergoing surgical treatment include minimizing the effects of surgery on speech, swallowing, and breathing while maximizing the likelihood of a cure of the cancer. Several different curative procedures are available that can offer voice-sparing results while achieving a positive cure rate for the patient who has an early laryngeal carcinoma. Surgical options include vocal cord stripping, cordectomy, laser surgery, partial laryngectomy, or total laryngectomy (NCI, 2019).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 515</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page516" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="516">p. 516</span></div>
<p class="h7">Vocal Cord Stripping</p>
<p class="nonindent">Stripping of the vocal cord is used to treat dysplasia, hyperkeratosis, and leukoplakia and is often curative for these lesions. The procedure involves removal of the mucosa of the edge of the vocal cord, using an operating microscope. Early vocal cord lesions are initially treated with radiation therapy.</p>
<p class="h7">Cordectomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cordectomy, which is an excision of the vocal cord, is usually performed via transoral laser. This procedure is used for lesions limited to the middle third of the vocal cord. The resulting voice quality is related to the extent of tissue removed.</p>
<p class="h7">Laser Surgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">Laser microsurgery is well known to have several advantages for the treatment of early glottic cancers. Treatment and recovery are shorter, with fewer side effects, and treatment may be less costly than for other forms of therapy. Microelectrodes are useful for surgical resection of smaller laryngeal carcinomas. The carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser can be used for the treatment of many laryngeal tumors, with the exception of large vascular tumors. When compared with the results of other treatments for early laryngeal cancer, laser microsurgery is considered to be the method of choice based on patient outcomes (NCI, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Partial Laryngectomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">A partial laryngectomy (laryngofissure&#x2013;thyrotomy) is often used for patients in the early stages of cancer in the glottic area when only one vocal cord is involved. The surgery is associated with a very high cure rate. It may also be performed for recurrence when high-dose radiation has failed. A portion of the larynx is removed, along with one vocal cord and the tumor; all other structures remain. The airway remains intact, and the patient is expected to have no difficulty swallowing. The voice quality may change, or the patient may sound hoarse.</p>
<p class="h7">Total Laryngectomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Complete removal of the larynx (total laryngectomy) can provide a cure in most advanced laryngeal cancers, when the tumor extends beyond the vocal cords, or for cancer that recurs or persists after radiation therapy. In a total laryngectomy, the laryngeal structures are removed, including the hyoid bone, epiglottis, cricoid cartilage, and two or three rings of the trachea. The tongue, pharyngeal walls, and most of the trachea are preserved. A total laryngectomy results in permanent loss of the voice and a change in the airway, requiring a permanent tracheostomy (<a href="#ff18-4">Fig.&#x00A0;18-4</a>). Occasionally, patients continue to have a laryngectomy tube in the stoma. Laryngectomy tubes are similar in appearance to tracheostomy tubes; however, a laryngectomy tube can be distinguished from a tracheostomy tube because the patient is unable to speak or breathe when the laryngectomy tube is occluded. Patients who have a total laryngectomy require alternatives to normal speech; these may include a prosthetic device, such as a Blom&#x2013;Singer valve, to speak without aspirating (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery is more difficult when the lesion involves the midline structures or both vocal cords. With or without neck dissection, a total laryngectomy requires a permanent tracheal stoma because the larynx that provides the protective sphincter is no longer present. The tracheal stoma prevents the aspiration of food and fluid into the lower respiratory tract. The patient has no voice but has normal swallowing. A total laryngectomy changes the manner in which airflow is used for breathing and speaking, as depicted in <a href="#ff18-4">Figure&#x00A0;18-4</a>. The patient has significant loss of the natural voice and the need to breathe through a stoma (an opening) created in the lower neck. Complications that may occur include a salivary leak, wound infection from the development of a pharyngocutaneous fistula, stomal stenosis, and dysphagia secondary to esophageal stricture. In some cases, the patient may be a candidate for a near-total laryngectomy. In this situation, the patient would be a candidate for chemoradiation therapy regimens postoperatively. Voice preservation can be achieved in most cases and tends to be associated with overall improved quality of life (<a href="#bib1440">Adil, 2018</a>). Advances in surgical techniques for treating laryngeal cancer may minimize the cosmetic and functional deficits previously seen with total <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page517" title="517"></span>laryngectomy. Some microlaryngeal surgery can be performed endoscopically.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Radiation Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of radiation therapy is to eradicate the cancer and preserve the function of the larynx. The decision to use radiation therapy is based on several factors, including the staging of the tumor and the patient&#x2019;s overall health status, lifestyle (including occupation), and personal preference. Excellent results have been achieved with radiation therapy in patients with early-stage glottic tumors when only one vocal cord is involved and there is normal mobility of the cord (i.e., with phonation), as well as in small supraglottic lesions. One of the benefits of radiation therapy is that patients retain a near-normal voice. A few may develop chondritis (inflammation of the cartilage) or stenosis; a small number may later require laryngectomy.</p>
<p class="indent">Radiation therapy may also be used preoperatively to reduce the tumor size. Radiation therapy is combined with surgery in advanced laryngeal cancer as adjunctive therapy to surgery or chemotherapy and as a palliative measure.</p>
<p class="indent">Complications from radiation therapy are a result of external radiation to the head and neck area, which may also include the parotid gland, which is responsible for mucus production. Symptoms may include acute mucositis, ulceration of the mucous membranes, pain, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;xerostomia:&lt;/b&gt; dryness of the mouth">xerostomia</button></strong> (dry mouth), loss of taste, dysphasia, fatigue, and skin reactions. Later complications may include laryngeal necrosis, edema, and fibrosis (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Speech Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient who undergoes a laryngectomy and the patient&#x2019;s family face potentially complex challenges, including significant changes in the ability to communicate. To minimize anxiety and frustration on the part of the patient and family, the loss or alteration of speech is discussed with them. To plan postoperative communication strategies and speech therapy, the speech therapist or pathologist conducts a preoperative evaluation (ACS, 2017). During this time, the nurse discusses with the patient and family the methods of communication that will be available in the immediate postoperative period. These include writing, lip speaking and reading, communication or word boards, or smartphones or other electronic devices. A system of communication is established with the patient, family, nurse, and primary provider and is implemented consistently after surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, a long-term postoperative communication plan for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;alaryngeal communication:&lt;/b&gt; alternative modes of speaking that do not involve the normal larynx; used by patients whose larynx has been surgically removed">alaryngeal communication</button></strong> (modes of speaking not involving the normal larynx) is developed. The three most common techniques of alaryngeal communication are esophageal speech, artificial larynx (electric larynx), and tracheoesophageal puncture. Training in these techniques begins once medical clearance is obtained from the primary provider.</p>
<p class="h7">Esophageal Speech</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient needs the ability to compress air into the esophagus and expel it, setting off a vibration of the pharyngeal esophageal segment for esophageal speech. The technique can be taught once the patient begins oral feedings, approximately 1 week after surgery. First, the patient learns to belch and is reminded to do so an hour after eating. Then, the technique is practiced repeatedly. Later, this conscious belching action is transformed into simple explosions of air from the esophagus for speech purposes. The speech therapist continues to work with the patient to make speech intelligible and as close to normal as possible. Because it takes a long time to become proficient, the success rate is low (ACS, 2017).</p>
<p class="h7">Artificial Larynx</p>
<p class="nonindent">If esophageal speech is not successful, or until the patient masters the technique, an electric larynx may be used for communication. This battery-powered apparatus projects sound into the oral cavity. When the mouth forms words (articulation), the sounds from the electric larynx become audible words. The voice that is produced sounds mechanical, and some words may be difficult to understand. The advantage is that the patient is able to communicate with relative ease while working to become proficient at either esophageal or tracheoesophageal puncture speech.</p>
<p class="h7">Tracheoesophageal Puncture</p>
<p class="nonindent">The third technique of alaryngeal speech is tracheoesophageal puncture (<a href="#ff18-5">Fig.&#x00A0;18-5</a>). This technique for voice restoration is simple and has few complications. It is associated with high phonation success, good phonation quality, and steady long-term results. This technique is the most widely used because the speech associated with it most resembles normal speech (the sound produced is a combination of esophageal speech and voice), and it is easily achieved either during the initial surgery to treat the tumor or at a later date (ACS, 2017). A valve is placed in the tracheal stoma to divert air into the esophagus and out the mouth. Once the puncture is surgically created and has healed, a voice prosthesis (Blom&#x2013;Singer) is fitted over the puncture site. A speech therapist teaches the patient how to produce sounds. Moving the tongue and lips to form the sound into words produces speech as before. To prevent airway obstruction, the prosthesis is removed and cleaned when mucus builds up.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse obtains a health history and assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical, psychosocial, and spiritual domains. The health history focuses on the following symptoms: hoarseness, sore throat, dyspnea, dysphagia, and pain or burning in the throat. The physical assessment includes a thorough head and neck examination with an emphasis on the patient&#x2019;s airway. In addition, the neck and thyroid are palpated for swelling, nodularity, or adenopathy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s general state of nutrition, including height and weight and body mass index and reviews laboratory values that assist in determining the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status (albumin, protein, glucose, and electrolyte levels). If treatment includes surgery, the nurse must know the nature of the surgery to plan appropriate care. If the patient is expected to have no voice as a result of the surgical procedure, a preoperative evaluation by the speech therapist is essential. The patient&#x2019;s ability to hear, see, read, and write is assessed. Visual impairment and functional illiteracy may create additional problems with communication and may require creative approaches to ensure that the patient is able to communicate any needs. Because alcohol abuse is a risk factor for cancer of the larynx, the patient&#x2019;s pattern of alcohol intake must be assessed. Patients who are accustomed to daily consumption of alcohol are at the risk for delirium tremens (alcohol withdrawal syndrome) when alcohol intake is stopped suddenly. It is also not uncommon that patients are active smokers at the time of diagnosis; assessment of readiness for smoking cessation should be done, and nicotine replacements prescribed to avoid nicotine withdrawal, as indicated (NCI, 2019) (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>: Promoting Cessation of Tobacco Use).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, the nurse assesses the psychological status of the patient and family. The fear of a diagnosis of cancer is compounded by the possibility of permanent voice loss and, in some cases, some degree of disfigurement. The nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s knowledge of the planned surgical procedure and expected postoperative course and assesses their coping methods and support systems. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s spirituality needs based on the patient&#x2019;s individual preferences, beliefs, and culture.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about the surgical procedure and postoperative course</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with the diagnosis of cancer and impending surgery</p>

<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Respiratory distress (hypoxia, airway obstruction, tracheal edema)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hemorrhage, infection, and wound breakdown</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Tracheostomal stenosis</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include attainment of an adequate level of knowledge, reduction in anxiety, maintenance of a patent airway (patient is able to handle own secretions), effective use of alternative means of communication, attainment of optimal levels of nutrition and hydration, improvement in body image and self-esteem, improved self-care management, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> P<small>REOPERATIVE</small> P<small>ATIENT</small> E<small>DUCATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer often produces misconceptions and fears. Many people assume that loss of speech and disfigurement are inevitable with this condition. Once the primary provider explains the diagnosis and discusses treatment options with the patient and family, the nurse clarifies any misconceptions by identifying the location of the larynx, its function, the nature of the planned surgical procedure, and its effect on speech. Further, the patient&#x2019;s ability to sing, laugh, and whistle will be lost. Informational materials (written and audiovisual) about the surgery are given to the patient and family for review and reinforcement. If a complete laryngectomy is planned, the patient must understand that the natural voice will be lost, but that special training can provide a means for communicating. The patient needs to know that until training is started, communication will be possible by using the call light, by writing, or by using a communication device. The interdisciplinary team conducts an initial assessment of the patient and family. In addition to the nurse and the primary provider, the team might include an advanced practice nurse (e.g., nurse practitioner), speech therapist, respiratory therapist, social worker, dietitian, and home health nurse. The services of a spiritual advisor are made available to the patient and family, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse also reviews equipment and treatments for postoperative care with the patient and family, educates the patient about important coughing and deep breathing exercises, and helps the patient perform return demonstrations. The nurse clarifies the patient&#x2019;s role in the postoperative and rehabilitation periods. The family&#x2019;s needs must also be addressed because family members are often responsible for complex care of the patient in the home.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page519" title="519"></span><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because surgery of the larynx is performed most often for a malignant tumor, the patient may have many questions: Will the surgeon be able to remove all of the tumor? Is it cancer? Will I die? Will I choke? Will I suffocate? Will I ever speak again? What will I look like? Because of these and other questions, the psychological preparation of the patient is as important as the physical preparation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Any patient undergoing surgery may have many fears. In laryngeal surgery, these fears may relate to the diagnosis of cancer and the possibility of permanent loss of the voice and disfigurement. The nurse provides the patient and family with opportunities to ask questions, verbalize feelings, and discuss perceptions. The nurse should address any questions and misconceptions the patient and family have. During the preoperative or postoperative period, a visit from someone who has had a laryngectomy may reassure the patient that people are available to assist and that rehabilitation is possible.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In the immediate postoperative period, the nurse attempts to build trust and reduce the patient&#x2019;s anxiety. Active listening provides an environment that promotes open communication and allows the patient to verbalize feelings. Clear instructions and explanations are given to the patient and family in a calm, reassuring manner. The nurse listens attentively, encourages the patient, and identifies and reduces environmental stressors. The nurse seeks to learn from the patient what activities promote feelings of comfort and assists the patient in such activities (e.g., listening to music, reading). Relaxation techniques such as guided imagery and meditation are often helpful. During episodes of severe anxiety, the nurse remains with the patient and includes them in decision making.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING A</small> P<small>ATENT</small> A<small>IRWAY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse helps maintain a patent airway by positioning the patient in the semi-Fowler or Fowler position after recovery from anesthesia. This position decreases surgical edema and promotes lung expansion. Observing the patient for restlessness, labored breathing, apprehension, and increased pulse rate helps identify possible respiratory or circulatory problems. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s lung sounds and reports changes that may indicate impending complications. Medications that depress respiration, particularly opioids, should be used cautiously. However, adequate use of analgesic medications is essential for pain relief because postoperative pain can result in shallow breathing and an ineffective cough (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for discussion of pain management). The nurse encourages the patient to turn, cough, and take deep breaths. If necessary, suctioning may be performed to remove secretions, but disruption of suture lines must be avoided. The nurse also encourages and assists the patient with early ambulation to prevent atelectasis, pneumonia, and venous thromboemboli formation (e.g., pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis). Pulse oximetry is used to monitor the patient&#x2019;s oxygen saturation level.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If a total laryngectomy was performed, a laryngectomy tube will most likely be in place. In some instances a laryngectomy tube is not used; in others it is used temporarily; and in many it is used permanently. The laryngectomy tube, which is shorter than a tracheostomy tube but has a larger diameter, is the patient&#x2019;s only airway. The care of this tube is similar to that for a tracheostomy tube (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). The nurse changes the inner cannula (if present) every 8 h if it is disposable. Although nondisposable tubes are used infrequently, if one is used, the nurse cleans the inner cannula every 8 h or more often as needed. If a tracheostomy tube without an inner cannula is used, humidification and suctioning of this tube are essential to prevent formation of mucus plugs. If a T-shaped laryngectomy tube is used, both sides of the T-tube should be suctioned to prevent obstruction due to copious secretions. The nurse should also use secure tracheostomy ties to prevent tube dislodgement. The nurse cleans the stoma daily with soap and water or another prescribed solution and a soft cloth or gauze, taking care to prevent water and soap or solution from entering the stoma. If a non&#x2013;oil-based antibiotic ointment is prescribed, it is applied around the stoma and suture line. If crusting appears around the stoma, the crusts are removed with sterile tweezers and additional ointment is applied.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Wound drains, inserted during surgery, may be in place to assist in removal of fluid and air from the surgical site. Suction also may be used, but cautiously, to avoid trauma to the surgical site and incision. The nurse observes, measures, and records drainage. When drainage is less than 30 mL/day for 2 consecutive days, the surgeon usually removes the drains.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Frequently, the patient coughs up large amounts of mucus through this opening. Because air passes directly into the trachea without being warmed and moistened by the upper respiratory mucosa, the tracheobronchial tree compensates by secreting excessive amounts of mucus. Therefore, the patient has frequent coughing episodes and may develop a brassy-sounding, mucus-producing cough. The nurse reassures the patient that these problems will diminish in time as the tracheobronchial mucosa adapts to the altered physiology.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After the patient coughs, the tracheostomy opening must be wiped clean and clear of mucus. A simple gauze dressing, washcloth, or even paper towel (because of its size and absorbency) worn below the tracheostomy may serve as a barrier to protect the clothing from the copious mucus that the patient may initially expel.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">One of the most important factors in decreasing cough, mucus production, and crusting around the stoma is adequate humidification of the environment. Mechanical humidifiers and aerosol generators (nebulizers) increase the humidity and are important for the patient&#x2019;s comfort. The laryngectomy tube may be removed when the stoma is well healed, within 3 to 6 wk after surgery. The nurse educates the patient about how to clean and change the tube and remove secretions.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> A<small>LTERNATIVE</small> C<small>OMMUNICATION</small> M<small>ETHODS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Establishing an effective means of communication is usually the ultimate goal in the rehabilitation of the laryngectomy patient. To understand and anticipate the patient&#x2019;s postoperative needs, the nurse works with the patient, speech therapist, and family to encourage the use of alternative communication methods. These means of communication are established preoperatively and must be used consistently by all personnel who come in contact with the patient postoperatively. The patient is now unable to use an intercom system. A call bell or hand bell must be placed within easy reach of the patient. In the immediate postoperative period, a handheld <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page520" title="520"></span>communication device like a Magic Slate, electronic tablet, notebook, or smartphone can be used. If the patient cannot write, a picture&#x2013;word&#x2013;phrase board or hand signals can be used. The nurse documents which hand is the patient&#x2019;s dominant hand (e.g., used for writing) so that the opposite arm can be used for IV infusions. (To ensure the patient&#x2019;s privacy, the nurse shreds notes used for communication.)</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Writing everything or communicating through gestures can be very time-consuming and frustrating. The patient must be given adequate time to communicate their needs. The patient may become impatient and angry when not understood.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> A<small>DEQUATE</small> N<small>UTRITION AND</small> H<small>YDRATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Postoperatively, the patient may not be permitted to eat or drink for at least 7 d (<a href="#bib1440">Suslu, 2016</a>). Alternative sources of nutrition and hydration include IV fluids, enteral feedings through a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, and parenteral nutrition (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;39</a> and <a href="c41.xhtml">41</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When the patient is ready to start oral feedings, a swallow study (a video fluoroscopy radiology procedure) may be conducted to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s risk of aspiration. Once the patient is cleared for oral feedings, the nurse explains that thick liquids will be used first because they are easy to swallow. Different swallowing maneuvers are attempted with various food consistencies. Once the patient is cleared for food intake, the nurse stays with the patient during initial oral feedings and keeps a suction setup at the bedside for needed suctioning. The nurse instructs the patient to avoid sweet foods, which increase salivation and suppress the appetite. Solid foods are introduced as tolerated. The patient is instructed to rinse the mouth with warm water or mouthwash after oral feedings and to brush the teeth frequently.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because taste and smell are so closely related, taste sensations are altered for a while after surgery because inhaled air passes directly into the trachea, bypassing the nose and the olfactory end organs. In time, however, the patient usually accommodates to this change and olfactory sensation adapts, often with return of interest in eating. The nurse observes the patient for any difficulty in swallowing, particularly when eating resumes, and reports its occurrence to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s weight and laboratory data are monitored to ensure that nutritional and fluid intake are adequate. In addition, skin turgor and vital signs are assessed for signs of decreased fluid volume.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> P<small>OSITIVE</small> B<small>ODY</small> I<small>MAGE AND</small> S<small>ELF</small>-E<small>STEEM</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Disfiguring surgery and an altered communication pattern are threats to a patient&#x2019;s body image and self-esteem. The reaction of family members and friends is a major concern for the patient. The nurse encourages the patient to express feelings about the changes brought about by surgery, particularly feelings related to fear, anger, depression, and isolation. Encouraging the use of previous effective coping strategies may be helpful. Referral to a support group, such as the International Association of Laryngectomees (IAL) and WebWhispers, and to resources available through the American Cancer Society may help the patient and family deal with the changes in their lives. Information about these support groups can be found in the Resources section at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> E<small>FFECTIVE</small> H<small>EALTH</small> M<small>ANAGEMENT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A positive approach along with promotion of effective health management is important when caring for the patient. The patient should begin participating in effective health management activities as soon as possible. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s readiness for decision making and encourages the patient to participate actively in performing care. Positive reinforcement is provided when the patient makes an effort in managing health effectively. The nurse needs to be a good listener and a support to the family, especially when explaining the tubes, dressings, and drains that are in place postoperatively.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The potential complications after laryngectomy include respiratory distress and hypoxia, hemorrhage, infection, wound breakdown, aspiration, and tracheostomal stenosis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Respiratory Distress and Hypoxia.</span> The nurse monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory distress and hypoxia, particularly restlessness, irritation, agitation, confusion, tachypnea, the use of accessory muscles, and decreased oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>). Any change in respiratory status requires immediate intervention. Hypoxia may cause restlessness and an initial rise in blood pressure; this is followed by hypotension and somnolence. Cyanosis is a late sign of hypoxia. Obstruction needs to be ruled out immediately by suctioning and by having the patient cough and breathe deeply. Hypoxia and airway obstruction, if not treated immediately, are life-threatening.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Other nursing measures include repositioning of the patient to ensure an open airway and administering oxygen as prescribed. Oxygen is used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The nurse should always be prepared for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation and must be knowledgeable about the hospital&#x2019;s emergency code protocols and skilled in the use of emergency equipment. The nurse must remain with the patient at all times during respiratory distress and initiate a call to the rapid response team as necessary.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Hemorrhage.</span> Bleeding from the drains at the surgical site or with tracheal suctioning may signal the occurrence of hemorrhage. The nurse promptly notifies the surgeon of any active bleeding, which can occur at a variety of sites, including the surgical site, drains, and trachea. Rupture of the carotid artery is especially dangerous. Should this occur, the nurse must apply direct pressure over the artery, summon assistance, and provide emotional support to the patient until the vessel is ligated. The nurse monitors vital signs for changes, particularly increased pulse rate, decreased blood pressure, and rapid deep respirations. Cold, clammy, pale skin may indicate active bleeding. IV fluids and blood components may be given and other measures implemented to prevent or treat hemorrhagic shock. (Management of the patient with shock is discussed in detail in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.)</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Infection.</span> The nurse monitors the patient for signs of postoperative infection. These include an increase in temperature and pulse, a change in the type of wound drainage, and increased areas of redness or tenderness at the surgical site. Other signs include purulent drainage, odor, and increased wound drainage. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s white blood cell (WBC) count; a rise in WBCs may indicate the body&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page521" title="521"></span>effort to combat infection. In older adult patients, infection can be present without an increase in the patient&#x2019;s WBC count; therefore, the nurse must monitor the patient for more subtle signs, such as lethargy, weakness, and decreased appetite. WBCs are suppressed in the patient with decreased immune function (e.g., patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy); this predisposes the patient to a severe infection and sepsis. Antimicrobial (antibiotic) medications must be given as scheduled. All suspicious drainage is cultured, and the patient may be placed on the appropriate infection prevention precautions. Strategies are implemented to minimize the exposure of the patient to microorganisms and their spread to others. The nurse reports any significant change in the patient&#x2019;s status to the surgeon.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Wound Breakdown.</span> Wound breakdown caused by infection, poor wound healing, development of a fistula, radiation therapy, or tumor growth can create a life-threatening emergency. The carotid artery, which is close to the stoma, may rupture from erosion if the wound does not heal properly. The nurse observes the stoma area for wound breakdown, hematoma, and bleeding and reports their occurrence to the surgeon. If wound breakdown occurs, the patient must be monitored carefully and identified as at high risk for carotid hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Aspiration.</span> The patient who has undergone a laryngectomy is at the risk for aspiration and aspiration pneumonia due to depressed cough, the sedating effects of anesthetic and analgesic medications, alteration in the airway, impaired swallowing, and the administration of tube feedings. The nurse assesses for the presence of nausea and administers antiemetic medications, as prescribed. The nurse keeps a suction setup available in the hospital and instructs the family to do so at home for use if needed. Patients receiving tube feedings are positioned with the head of the bed at 30 degrees or higher during feedings and for 30 to 45 min after tube feedings. Patients receiving oral feedings are positioned with the head of the bed in an upright position for 30 to 45 min after feedings. For patients with a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, the placement of the tube and residual gastric volume must be checked before each feeding. High amounts of residual volume (greater than 50% of previous intake) indicate delayed gastric emptying; this can lead to reflux and aspiration (<a href="#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Signs or symptoms of aspiration are reported to the primary provider immediately.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Tracheostomal Stenosis.</span> Tracheostomal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the trachea or the tracheostomy stoma. Infection at the stoma site, excessive traction on the tracheostomy tube by the connecting tubing, and persistent high tracheostomy cuff pressure are risk factors for tracheostomal stenosis. The incidence of this condition varies widely, and it is often preventable. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s stoma for signs and symptoms of infection and reports any evidence of this to the primary provider immediately. Tracheostomy care is performed routinely. The nurse assesses the connecting tubing (e.g., ventilation tubing) and secures the tubing to avoid excessive traction on the patient&#x2019;s tracheostomy. The nurse ensures that the tracheostomy cuff is deflated (for a patient with a cuffed tube) except for short periods, such as when the patient is eating or taking medications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The nurse has an important role in the recovery and rehabilitation of the patient who has had a laryngectomy. To facilitate the patient&#x2019;s ability to manage self-care, discharge instruction begins as soon as the patient is able to participate. Nursing care and patient education in the hospital, outpatient setting, and rehabilitation or long-term care facility must take into consideration the many emotions, physical changes, and lifestyle changes experienced by the patient. In preparing the patient to go home, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s readiness to learn and the level of knowledge about self-care management. The nurse also reassures the patient and family that most self-care management strategies can be mastered. The patient needs to learn a variety of self-care behaviors, including tracheostomy and stoma care, wound care, and oral hygiene. The nurse also instructs the patient about the need for adequate dietary intake, safe hygiene, and recreational activities.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="H6"><em>Tracheostomy and Stoma Care.</em></span> The nurse provides specific instructions to the patient and family about what to expect with a tracheostomy and its management. The nurse instructs the patient and caregiver how to perform suctioning and emergency measures and tracheostomy and stoma care. The nurse stresses the importance of humidification at home and instructs the family to obtain and set up a humidification system before the patient returns home.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box521"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for care of the patient with a tracheostomy tube, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="H6"><em>Hygiene and Safety Measures.</em></span> The nurse instructs the patient and family about safety precautions that are needed because of the changes in structure and function resulting from the surgery. Special precautions are needed in the shower to prevent water from entering the stoma. Wearing a loose-fitting plastic bib over the tracheostomy or simply holding a hand over the opening is effective. Swimming is not recommended because a person with a laryngectomy can drown without submerging their face. Barbers and beauticians need to be alerted so that hair sprays, loose hair, and powder do not get near the stoma, because they can block or irritate the trachea and possibly cause infection. These self-care points are summarized in <a href="#ct18-7">Chart&#x00A0;18-7</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse educates the patient and caregiver about the signs and symptoms of infection and identifies indications that require contacting the primary provider after discharge. A discussion regarding cleanliness and infection control behaviors is essential. The nurse educates the patient and family to use hand hygiene before and after caring for the tracheostomy, to use tissues to remove mucus, and to dispose of soiled dressings and equipment properly. If the patient&#x2019;s surgery included cervical lymph node dissection, the nurse instructs the patient about how to perform exercises to strengthen the shoulder and neck muscles. A referral to a physical therapist might be helpful.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Recreation and exercise are important for the patient&#x2019;s well-being and quality of life, and all but very strenuous exercise <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page522" title="522"></span>can be enjoyed safely. Avoidance of strenuous exercise and fatigue is important because the patient will have more difficulty speaking when tired, which can be discouraging. Additional safety points to address include the need for the patient to wear or carry medical identification, such as a bracelet or card, to alert medical personnel to the special requirements for resuscitation should this need arise. If resuscitation is needed, direct mouth-to-stoma ventilation should be performed. For home emergency situations, prerecorded emergency messages for police, the fire department, or other rescue services can be kept near the phone or programmed into smartphones or other electronic devices to be used quickly.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse instructs and encourages the patient to perform oral care frequently to prevent halitosis and infection. If the patient is receiving radiation therapy, synthetic saliva may be required because of decreased saliva production. Patients receiving radiation therapy frequently report dry mouth, change in taste, lack of appetite, and mouth sores (<a href="#bib1397">Cullen, Baumler, Farrington, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct18-8">Chart&#x00A0;18-8</a>).

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Mitigating the Effects of Radiation Therapy on the Oral Mucosa of Patients with Head and Neck Cancers</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Cullen, L., Baumler, S., Farrington, M., et&#x00A0;al. (2018). Oral care for head and neck cancer symptom management. <em>American Journal of Nursing, 118</em>(1), 24&#x2013;34.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients diagnosed with laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancer (head and neck cancer [HNC]) commonly receive radiation therapy on an outpatient basis. These patients often develop mucositis, which causes symptoms that include pain, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, change in taste, lack of appetite, and mouth sores. An evidence-based practice intervention at a radiation oncology center in a large academic medical center in the Midwestern United States was designed to reduce the severity of oral mucositis in adults receiving radiation therapy for HNC.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Study participants included adults with HNC who were receiving outpatient radiation therapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Twenty participants were recruited to the usual care group. The usual care group received extensive oral care preparation prior to radiation treatment. This included a visit with an oncologic dentist for a professional dental evaluation, fluoride treatments, the provision of oral care supplies, and tooth extraction if needed. Radiation treatment then proceeded as usual for 6 to 8 wk. These participants served as historical controls for the intervention group.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The 85 participants who were then recruited into the intervention group received the same care as those in the usual care group plus targeted education, a comprehensive oral care kit, and information on how to use the kit. The targeted education included a brochure from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <em>Head and Neck Radiation Treatment and Your Mouth</em>, and a one-page additional insert, which was developed by the team. Nurses were integral throughout the study process in educating patients about the intervention.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Both clinicians and participants were surveyed at various intervals. Clinicians&#x2019; (i.e., nurses, physicians, and radiation therapists) knowledge of oral care and correct use of oral care products, perceptions and attitudes about oral care, and behaviors and practices related to the documentation of patients&#x2019; oral health and education were assessed. Participant feedback was obtained before radiation treatment, during weeks 4 to 5 of treatment, and 1 mo after treatment. The participants&#x2019; questionnaires included sections that surveyed oral care practices (the frequency of care and products used), perceptions about oral care (feeling well prepared and the usefulness of oral care products), and oral mucositis symptoms.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The percentage of clinicians with correct responses to knowledge assessment items improved from 71% preimplementation to 80% postimplementation. The clinicians&#x2019; mean scores on questions capturing their perceptions were higher postimplementation than preimplementation.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Feedback provided by patients during radiation treatment on weeks 4 to 5 demonstrated improvement in oral hygiene behaviors. More patients in the intervention group reported brushing at least daily, using Biotene toothpaste, performing oral rinses at least twice a day, and using lanolin lip balm, compared with those in the usual care group. Patients in the intervention group showed higher adherence with the targeted education and oral care kit intervention which led to a reduction of symptoms at weeks 4 to 5 of radiation treatment, when symptoms are expected to peak. The intervention group reported less severity than the usual care patients regarding the following symptoms: mouth and throat soreness, difficulty swallowing, difficulty eating, and difficulty talking. Furthermore, the intervention group reported less difficulty with xerostomia 1 mo after radiation was completed.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Mucositis is a frequent and distressing complication of radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with HNC. Nurses are key members of the treatment team and play many roles in caring for these patients, from assessing patients&#x2019; symptoms to educating them on ways to reduce these symptoms. Findings from this study show that the distribution of standardized oral care kits and related educational materials can offer an effective way to meet patients&#x2019; needs and reduce oral mucositis severity in adults treated with radiation therapy for HNC. The success of the project also highlights the key role nurses play in cancer symptom management, before radiation therapy begins, throughout the course of treatment, and in the months afterward.</p>
