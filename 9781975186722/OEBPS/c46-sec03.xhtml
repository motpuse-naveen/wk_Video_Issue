<h4 class="h4" id="s2032">Hypoglycemia (Insulin Reactions)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoglycemia means low (hypo) sugar in the blood (glycemia) and occurs when the blood glucose falls to less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (ADA, 2020). It can occur when there is too much insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, too little food, or excessive physical activity. Hypoglycemia may occur at any time of the day or night. It often occurs before meals, especially if meals are delayed or snacks are omitted. For example, midmorning hypoglycemia may occur when the morning insulin is peaking, whereas hypoglycemia that occurs in the late afternoon coincides with the peak of the morning NPH insulin. Middle-of-the-night hypoglycemia may occur because of peaking evening or predinner NPH insulins, especially in patients who have not eaten a bedtime snack.</p>

<p class="nonindent">In older patients with diabetes, hypoglycemia is a particular concern for many reasons:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Older adults frequently live alone and may not recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>With decreasing kidney function, it takes longer for oral hypoglycemic agents to be excreted by the kidneys.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Skipping meals may occur because of decreased appetite or financial limitations.</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Decreased visual acuity may lead to errors in insulin administration.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2034">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia may be grouped into two categories: adrenergic symptoms and central nervous system (CNS) symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">In mild hypoglycemia, as the blood glucose level falls, the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, resulting in a surge of epinephrine and norepinephrine. This causes symptoms such as sweating, tremor, tachycardia, palpitation, nervousness, and hunger.</p>
<p class="indent">In moderate hypoglycemia, the drop in blood glucose level deprives the brain cells of needed fuel for functioning. Signs of impaired function of the CNS may include inability to concentrate, headache, lightheadedness, confusion, memory lapses, numbness of the lips and tongue, slurred speech, impaired coordination, emotional changes, irrational or combative behavior, double vision, and drowsiness. Any combination of these symptoms (in addition to adrenergic symptoms) may occur with moderate hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="indent">In severe hypoglycemia, CNS function is so impaired that the patient needs the assistance of another person for treatment of hypoglycemia. Symptoms may include disoriented behavior, seizures, difficulty arousing from sleep, or loss of consciousness.</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">It is important to check the patient&#x2019;s blood glucose level and correlate it with the patient&#x2019;s symptoms. If the blood glucose level is low but the patient is not exhibiting any symptoms, the nurse should double-check the glucose level to ensure that it is correct.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2035">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and vary considerably from person to person. Decreased hormonal (adrenergic) response to hypoglycemia may contribute to lack of symptoms of hypoglycemia. This occurs in some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1513" title="1513"></span>patients who have had diabetes for many years. It may be related to autonomic neuropathy, which is a chronic diabetic complication (see later discussion). As the blood glucose level falls, the normal surge in adrenalin does not occur, and the usual adrenergic symptoms, such as sweating and shakiness, do not take place. The hypoglycemia may not be detected until moderate or severe CNS impairment occurs. Affected patients must perform SMBG on a frequent regular basis, especially before driving or engaging in other potentially dangerous activities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2036">Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Treating with Carbohydrates</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate treatment must be given when hypoglycemia occurs (ADA, 2020). The usual recommendation is for 15 to 20 g of a fast-acting concentrated source of carbohydrate. It is not necessary to add sugar to juice, even if it is labeled as unsweetened juice, because the fruit sugar in juice contains enough carbohydrate to raise the blood glucose level. Adding table sugar to juice may cause a sharp increase in the blood glucose level, and patients may experience hyperglycemia for hours after treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Initiating Emergency Measures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In adults whose glucose level is less than 54 mg/dL (3.0&#x00A0;mmol/L) or who are unconscious and cannot swallow, an injection of glucagon 1 mg can be given either subcutaneously or intramuscularly (ADA, 2020). Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas that stimulates the liver to breakdown glycogen, the stored glucose. Injectable glucagon is packaged as a powder in 1-mg vials and must be mixed with a diluent immediately before being injected. After injection of glucagon, the patient may take as long as 20 minutes to regain consciousness. A concentrated source of carbohydrate followed by a snack should be given to the patient on awakening to prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia (because the duration of the action of 1&#x00A0;mg of glucagon is brief&#x2014;its onset is 8 to 10 minutes, and its action lasts 12 to 27 minutes) and to replenish liver stores of glucose. Some patients experience nausea after the administration of glucagon. If this occurs, the patient should be turned to the side to prevent aspiration in case the patient vomits.</p>
<p class="indent">Glucagon is sold by prescription only and should be part of the emergency supplies available to patients with diabetes who require insulin. Family members, caregivers, and coworkers should be instructed in the use of glucagon, especially for patients who have little or no warning of hypoglycemic episodes (ADA, 2020). Patients should be instructed to notify their primary provider after severe hypoglycemia has occurred and been treated. Close monitoring for 24 hours following a hypoglycemic episode is indicated because the patient is at increased risk of another episode (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">In hospitals and emergency departments, for patients who are unconscious or cannot swallow, 25 to 50 mL of dextrose 50% in water (D<sub>50</sub>W) may be administered IV. The effect is usually seen within minutes. The patient may complain of a headache and of pain at the injection site. Ensuring patency of the IV line used for injection of 50% dextrose is essential because hypertonic solutions such as 50% dextrose are very irritating to veins.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Providing Patient Education</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoglycemia is prevented by a consistent pattern of eating, administering insulin, and exercising. Between-meal and bedtime snacks may be needed to counteract the maximum insulin effect. In general, the patient should cover the time of peak activity of insulin by eating a snack and by taking additional food when physical activity is increased. Routine blood glucose tests are performed so that changing insulin requirements may be anticipated and the dosage adjusted. Because unexpected hypoglycemia can occur, all patients treated with insulin should wear an identification bracelet or tag stating that they have diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients, family members, and coworkers must be instructed to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Family members in particular must be made aware that any subtle (but unusual) change in behavior may be an indication of hypoglycemia. They should be taught to encourage and even insist that the person with diabetes assess blood glucose levels if hypoglycemia is suspected. Some patients become very resistant to testing or eating and become angry with family members who are trying to treat the hypoglycemia. Family members must be taught to persevere and to understand that the hypoglycemia can cause irrational behavior, due to low supply of glucose to the brain.</p>
<p class="indent">Autonomic neuropathy or beta-blockers such as propranolol to treat hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias may mask the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia. It is very important that patients taking these medications perform blood glucose tests on a frequent and regular basis. Patients who have type 2 diabetes and who take oral sulfonylurea agents may also develop hypoglycemia, which can be prolonged and severe; this is a particular risk for older adult patients.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important that patients with diabetes, especially those receiving insulin, learn to carry some form of simple sugar with them at all times (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Davidson et al., 2018</a>). There are commercially prepared glucose tablets and gels that the patient may find convenient to carry. If the patient has a hypoglycemic reaction and does not have any of the recommended emergency foods available, any available food (preferably a carbohydrate food) should be eaten.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients are advised to refrain from eating high-calorie, high-fat dessert foods (e.g., cookies, cakes, doughnuts, ice cream) to treat hypoglycemia because their high-fat content may slow the absorption of the glucose and resolution of the hypoglycemic symptoms. The patient may subsequently eat more of the foods when symptoms do not resolve rapidly, which may cause very high blood glucose levels for several hours and may contribute to weight gain.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who feel unduly restricted by their meal plan may view hypoglycemic episodes as a time to reward themselves with desserts. Instructing these patients to incorporate occasional desserts into the meal plan may be more effective, because this may make it easier for them to limit their treatment of hypoglycemic episodes to simple (low-calorie) carbohydrates such as juice or glucose tablets. Patients should be instructed to report all severe hypoglycemic episodes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1514" title="1514"></span>in addition to any increase in the incidence, frequency, and severity to the primary provider.</p>
