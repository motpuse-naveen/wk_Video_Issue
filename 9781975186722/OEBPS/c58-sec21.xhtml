<h4 class="h4" id="s2808">Conjunctivitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva) is a common ocular disorder worldwide. It is characterized by a pink appearance (hence the common term <em>pink eye</em>) because of subconjunctival blood vessel congestion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2809">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General symptoms include foreign-body sensation, scratching or burning sensation, itching, and photophobia. Conjunctivitis may be unilateral or bilateral, but the infection usually starts in one eye and then spreads to the other eye by hand contact.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2810">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The four main clinical features important to evaluate are the type of discharge (watery, mucoid, purulent, or mucopurulent), type of conjunctival reaction (follicular or papillary), presence of pseudomembranes or true membranes, and presence or absence of lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes where the eyelids drain). Pseudomembranes consist of coagulated exudate that adheres to the surface of the inflamed conjunctiva. True membranes form when the exudate adheres to the superficial layer of the conjunctiva, and removal results in bleeding. Follicles are multiple, slightly elevated lesions encircled by tiny blood vessels; they look like grains of rice. Papillae are hyperplastic conjunctival epithelium in numerous projections that are usually seen as a fine mosaic pattern under slit-lamp examination. Diagnosis is based on the distinctive characteristics of ocular signs, acute or chronic presentation, and identification of any precipitating events. Positive results of swab smear preparations and cultures confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2811">Types of Conjunctivitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Conjunctivitis is classified according to its cause. The major causes are microbial infection, allergy, and irritating toxic stimuli. A wide spectrum of organisms can cause conjunctivitis, including bacteria (e.g., <em>Chlamydia</em>), viruses, fungus, and parasites. Conjunctivitis can also result from an existing ocular infection or can be a manifestation of a systemic disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Microbial Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="h7">Bacterial Conjunctivitis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bacterial conjunctivitis can be acute or chronic. The acute type can develop into a chronic condition. Signs and symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis is usually seen in patients with lacrimal duct obstruction, chronic dacryocystitis, and chronic blepharitis. The most common causative microorganisms are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Bacterial conjunctivitis manifests with an acute onset of redness, burning, and discharge. There is papillary formation, conjunctival irritation, and injection in the fornices. The exudates are variable but are usually present on waking in the morning. The eyes may be difficult to open because of adhesions caused by the exudate. Purulent discharge occurs in severe acute bacterial infections, whereas mucopurulent discharge appears in mild cases. In gonococcal conjunctivitis, the symptoms are more acute. The exudate is profuse and purulent, and there is lymphadenopathy. Pseudomembranes may be present.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;trachoma:&lt;/b&gt; an infectious disease caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/em&gt;&#x2014;the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world">Trachoma</button></strong> is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis,</em> an ancient disease and the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>). It is prevalent in areas with hot, dry, and dusty climates and in areas with poor living conditions. It is spread by direct contact or by carrier (e.g., insects such as flies and gnats). The onset of trachoma in children is usually insidious, but it can be acute or subacute in adults. The initial symptoms include red inflamed eyes, tearing, photophobia, ocular pain, purulent exudates, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and lid edema. Initial ocular signs include follicular and papillary formations. At the middle stage of the disease, there is an acute inflammation with papillary hypertrophy and follicular necrosis, after which trichiasis and entropion begin to develop. The lashes that are turned in rub against the cornea and, after prolonged irritation, cause corneal erosion and ulceration. The late stage of the disease is characterized by scarred conjunctiva, subepithelial keratitis, abnormal vascularization of the cornea (pannus), and residual scars from the follicles that look like depressions in the conjunctiva (Herbert pits). Severe corneal ulceration can lead to perforation and blindness.</p>
<p class="indent">Inclusion conjunctivitis affects sexually active people who have genital chlamydial infection. Transmission is by oral&#x2013;genital sex or hand-to-eye transmission. Indirect transmission can occur in inadequately chlorinated swimming pools. The eye lesions usually appear a week after exposure and may be associated with a nonspecific urethritis or cervicitis. The discharge is mucopurulent, follicles are present, and there is lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p class="h7">Viral Conjunctivitis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Viral conjunctivitis can be acute and chronic. The discharge is watery, and follicles are prominent. Severe cases include pseudomembranes. The common causative organisms are adenovirus and herpes simplex virus. Conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus is highly contagious. The condition is usually preceded by symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Corneal involvement causes extreme photophobia. Symptoms include tearing, redness, and foreign-body sensation that can involve one or both eyes. There is lid edema, ptosis, and conjunctival <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hyperemia:&lt;/b&gt; red eyes resulting from dilation of the vasculature of the conjunctiva">hyperemia</button></strong> (red eyes caused by dilation of blood vessels) (see <a href="#ff58-15">Fig. 58-15</a>). These signs and symptoms vary from mild to severe. Viral conjunctivitis, although self-limited, tends to last longer than bacterial conjunctivitis.</p>

<p class="indent">Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis that is easily transmitted from one person to another among household members, schoolchildren, and health care workers. The outbreak of epidemics is seasonal, especially during the summer when people use swimming pools. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is most often accompanied by preauricular lymphadenopathy and occasionally periorbital pain. There are marked follicular and papillary formations. This type of conjunctivitis can lead to keratopathy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Allergic Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immunologic or allergic conjunctivitis is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs as part of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), or it can be an independent allergic reaction. The patient usually has a history of an allergy to pollens and other environmental allergens. There is extreme pruritus, epiphora (excessive secretion of tears), injection, and usually severe photophobia. The stringlike mucoid discharge is usually associated with rubbing the eyes because of severe pruritus. Vernal conjunctivitis is also known as seasonal conjunctivitis because it appears mostly during warm weather. There may be large formations of papillae that have a cobblestone appearance. It is more common in children and young adults. Most affected people have a history of asthma or eczema.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Toxic Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chemical conjunctivitis can be the result of medications; chlorine from swimming pools; exposure to toxic fumes among industrial workers; or exposure to other irritants such as smoke, hair sprays, acids, and alkalis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2812">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of conjunctivitis depends on the type. Most types of mild and viral conjunctivitis are self-limiting, benign conditions that may not require treatment and laboratory procedures. For more severe cases, topical antibiotic agents, eye drops, or ointments are prescribed. Patients with gonococcal conjunctivitis require urgent antibiotic therapy. If left untreated, this ocular disease can lead to corneal perforation and blindness. The systemic complications can include meningitis and sepsis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bacterial Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is almost always self-limiting, lasting 2 weeks if left untreated. If treated with antibiotics, it may last a few days, except for gonococcal and staphylococcal conjunctivitis.</p>
<p class="indent">For trachoma, usually broad-spectrum antibiotic agents are given topically and systemically. Surgical management includes the correction of trichiasis to prevent conjunctival scarring.</p>
<p class="indent">Adult inclusion conjunctivitis requires 1 week of antibiotics. Prevention of reinfection is important, and affected people and their sexual partners must seek treatment for sexually transmitted infection, if indicated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Viral Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Viral conjunctivitis is not responsive to any treatment. Cold compresses may alleviate some symptoms. Viral conjunctivitis, especially epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, is highly contagious. Patients must be made aware of the contagious nature of the disease, and adequate education must be provided (see <a href="#ct58-12">Chart 58-12</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Proper steps must be taken to avoid health care&#x2013;associated infections. Frequent hand hygiene and procedures for environmental cleaning and disinfection of equipment used for eye examination must be strictly followed at all times. To prevent spread during outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus, health care facilities must set aside specified areas <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1929" title="1929"></span>for treating patients diagnosed with or suspected of having conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus. All forms of tonometry must be avoided unless medically indicated. All multidose ophthalmic medications must be discarded at the end of each day or when contaminated. Employees who are infected and others must not be allowed to work or attend school until symptoms have resolved, which can take 3 to 7 days.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Education for Patients with Viral Conjunctivitis</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Viral conjunctivitis is a highly contagious eye infection that can easily spread from one person to another. The symptoms can be alarming but are not serious.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse instructs the patient about this eye condition and the following self-care strategies:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that your eyes will look red and will have watery discharge, and your lids will be swollen for about a week.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Expect to experience eye pain, a sandy sensation in your eye, and sensitivity to light.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep in mind that symptoms will resolve after about 1 week.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use lightweight cold compresses over your eyes for about 10 minutes four to five times a day to soothe the pain.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use artificial tears for the sandy sensation in your eye and mild pain medications such as acetaminophen.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Stay at home and do not go outside. You may return to work or school after 7 days, when the redness and discharge have cleared. Obtain a note from your primary provider to return to work or school.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not share towels, linens, makeup, or any items that have come in contact with your eyes.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water frequently.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use a new tissue every time you wipe the discharge from your eye. Dampen the tissue with clean water to clean the outside of the eye.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wash your face and take a shower as you normally do.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Discard all of your makeup articles and do not apply makeup until the infection has resolved.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wear dark glasses if bright lights bother you.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Note if the discharge from your eye turns yellowish and purulent or if your vision changes and return to the primary provider for an examination.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Allergic Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with allergic conjunctivitis, especially recurrent vernal or seasonal conjunctivitis, are usually given corticosteroids in ophthalmic preparations. Depending on the severity of the disease, they may be given oral preparations. The use of vasoconstrictors, such as topical epinephrine solution, cold compresses, ice packs, and cool ventilation usually provide comfort by decreasing swelling.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Toxic Conjunctivitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For conjunctivitis caused by chemical irritants, the eye must be irrigated immediately and profusely with saline or sterile water.</p>
