<h4 class="h4" id="s137">Prevention of Chronic Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The CDC (2019a) has identified risk factors for common chronic diseases and pointed out that most American adults have more than one of the following risk factors:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Hypertension (high blood pressure)</span></li>
<li><span>Tobacco and ENDS use or exposure to secondhand smoke</span></li>
<li><span>Overweight or obesity (high BMI)</span></li>
<li><span>Lack of physical activity</span></li>
<li><span>Excessive alcohol use</span></li>
<li><span>Consumption of diets low in fruits and vegetables</span></li>
<li><span>Consumption of food high in sodium and saturated fats</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The WHO (2005, 2013) has identified high-impact, cost-effective interventions to prevent premature death due to chronic disease or chronic conditions that can be implemented even in settings with limited resources. These interventions, summarized in <a href="#ct7-9">Chart&#x00A0;7-9</a>, are consistent with the risk factors for chronic disease identified by the CDC.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient education to prevent chronic disease or reduce its severity or effects is another important component of the nurse&#x2019;s role in working with patients to identify risks for chronic disease and to identify strategies to reduce those risks. Health promotion and patient education are discussed in detail in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> in this book.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s138">Characteristics of Chronic Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sometimes it is difficult for people who are disease free to understand the profound effect that chronic illness often has on the lives of patients and their families. It is easy for health professionals to focus on the illness or disability itself while overlooking the person who has the disorder. In all illnesses, but even more so with chronic conditions, the illness cannot be separated from the person. People with chronic illness must contend with it daily (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>). To properly manage their chronic condition, individuals often have to find the time, as well as the social and financial resources, to participate in physically and psychologically beneficial activities, work with health care professionals to follow treatment guidelines, monitor their health and make decisions about their health and lifestyle and those of their family, and manage the effects of the illness on their physical, psychological, and social well-being. To relate to what people must cope with or to plan effective interventions, nurses must understand the multiple characteristics of a chronic illness.</p>

<ul class="bull"><li><span>Psychological and social issues: Managing chronic illness involves more than treating medical problems. Associated psychological and social issues must also be addressed, because living for long periods with illness symptoms and disability can threaten identity, bring about role changes, alter body image, and disrupt lifestyles, work, and family life. These changes require continuous adaptation and accommodation, depending on the patient&#x2019;s age and situation in life. Each change or decline in functional ability requires physical, emotional, and social adaptation for patients and their families (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib459">Corbin, 2003</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>).</span></li>
<li><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page160" title="160"></span>Course of chronic disease: Chronic health conditions usually involve many different phases over the course of a person&#x2019;s lifetime. There can be acute periods, stable and unstable periods, flare-ups, and remissions. Each phase brings its own set of physical, psychological, and social problems, and each requires its own regimens and types of management. Individuals with chronic illnesses may experience high levels of stress or anxiety with each change in the course of their illness.</span></li>
<li><span>Progression of chronic disease: The rate of progression of chronic diseases can vary from a rapid downhill course leading quickly to disability and death within a few months of onset to those with a slow downhill progression over years. Others may be characterized by disappearance of signs and symptoms with a return to &#x201C;normal&#x201D; with later return of symptoms, or relapses.</span></li>
<li><span>Therapeutic regimens: Keeping chronic conditions under control requires persistent adherence to therapeutic regimens that may be complex and may interfere with usual activities or even life goals. Failing to adhere to a treatment plan or to do so consistently increases the risks of developing complications and accelerating the disease process. However, the realities of daily life, including the impact of culture, values, and socioeconomic factors, affect the degree to which people adhere to a treatment regimen. Managing a chronic illness takes time, requires knowledge and often planning, and can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. It is not unusual for patients to stop taking medications or alter dosages because of side effects that are more disturbing or disruptive than symptoms of the illness, or to cut back on regimens they consider overly time-consuming, fatiguing, or costly (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib459">Corbin, 2003</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Development of other chronic conditions: One chronic disease can lead to the development of other chronic conditions. Diabetes, for example, can lead to neurologic and vascular changes that may result in visual, cardiac, and kidney diseases and erectile dysfunction. The presence of a chronic illness also contributes to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute health conditions as well as greater utilization of clinical services during hospitalization.</span></li>
<li><span>Family life: Chronic illness affects the entire family. Family life can be dramatically altered as a result of role reversals, unfilled roles, loss of income, time required to manage the illness, decreases in family socialization activities, and the costs of treatment. Family members often become caregivers for the person with chronic illness while trying to continue to work and keep the family intact. Over 16.6% of the U.S. adult population are considered caregivers for a family member with a chronic illness, or with a disability, or who is an older adult. Although many caregivers derive positive effects from providing care, many are employed and attempting to maintain as normal a life as possible for their families. Stress, depression, fatigue, and loss of sleep as well as missed days of work are not uncommon. Thus, the wellbeing of caregivers merits attention by nurses and other health care providers (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Hopps, Iadeluca, &#x0026; McDonald, 2017</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Home life: The day-to-day management of illness is largely the responsibility of people with chronic disorders and their families. As a result, the home, rather than the hospital, is the center of care in chronic conditions. Hospitals, clinics, primary care providers&#x2019; offices, nursing homes, nursing centers, and community agencies (home care services, social services, and disease-specific associations and societies) are considered adjuncts or backup services to daily home management.</span></li>
<li><span>Self-management: The management of chronic conditions is a continual process. People can be taught how to manage their conditions. However, each patient must discover how his or her own body reacts under varying circumstances&#x2014;for example, what it is like to be hypoglycemic, what activities are likely to bring on angina, and how these or other conditions can best be prevented and managed.</span></li>
<li><span>Collaborative process: Managing chronic conditions must be a collaborative process that involves many different health care professionals working together with patients and their families to provide the services and supports that are often needed for management at home. The medical, social, and psychological aspects of chronic health problems are often complex, especially in severe conditions.</span></li>
<li><span>Health care costs: The management of chronic conditions is expensive. Many expenses incurred by an individual patient (e.g., costs for hospital stays, diagnostic tests, equipment, medications, and supportive services) may be covered by health insurance and by federal and state agencies. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, the most significant change to health care policy in the United States since the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, has made available health insurance for many previously uninsured individuals who were unable to obtain health insurance. The ACA has ended lifetime and most annual limits on health care, provided patients with access to recommended preventive services, and banned the practice of denying coverage because of the presence of a preexisting health condition (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Krahn et al., 2015</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Lost income: Direct out-of-pocket expenses can represent a significant percent of income, especially in low- and middle-income families. These expenses include high copays and deductibles that must be paid out of pocket. Those with serious chronic disorders may have difficulty paying for care, resulting in bankruptcy or having to rely on family or friends to pay for health insurance or health care. People from low-income groups who do not receive adequate health care get sicker and die sooner from chronic diseases than those from groups with higher levels of education, greater financial resources, and access to care (WHO, 2017a). If a family&#x2019;s primary income earner becomes ill, chronic diseases can result in drastic loss in income with inadequate funds for food, education, and health care. Furthermore, affected families may become unstable and impoverished.</span></li>
<li><span>Ethical issues: Chronic conditions raise difficult ethical issues for patients, families, health care professionals, and society. Issues include how to control costs, how to allocate scarce resources (e.g., organs for transplantation), what constitutes quality of life, and if and when life support should be withdrawn.</span></li></ul>
<p class="BL1Last"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page161" title="161"></span><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Living with uncertainty: Having a chronic illness means living with uncertainty. Although health care providers may be aware of the usual progression of a chronic disease such as Parkinson&#x2019;s disease or multiple sclerosis, no one can predict with certainty the course of a person&#x2019;s illness. Even when a patient is in remission or symptom free, the person often fears that symptoms will reappear.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s139">Implications of Managing Chronic Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic conditions have implications for everyday living and management for people and their families as well as for society at large (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>). Most importantly, individual efforts should be directed at preventing chronic conditions, because many&#x2014;but not all&#x2014;chronic illnesses or disorders are linked to unhealthy lifestyles or behaviors such as smoking and overeating. Therefore, changes in lifestyle can prevent some chronic disorders or at least delay onset until a later age. Because most people resist change, bringing about alterations in people&#x2019;s lifestyles is a major challenge for nurses.</p>
<p class="indent">Once a chronic condition has occurred, the focus shifts to managing symptoms, avoiding complications (e.g., eye complications in a person with diabetes), and preventing other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia in a person with chronic obstructive lung disease). Quality of life&#x2014;often overlooked by health care professionals in their approach to people with chronic conditions&#x2014;is also important. Health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise, are essential to quality of life even in people who have chronic illnesses or disabilities, because it helps maintain functional status (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although coworkers, extended family, and health care professionals are affected by chronic illnesses, the problems of living with chronic conditions are most acutely experienced by individuals and their immediate families. They experience the greatest impact, with lifestyle changes that directly affect quality of life. Nurses provide not only direct care, especially during acute episodes, but also education and they help secure the resources and other supports that enable people to integrate their illness into their lives and to have an acceptable quality of life despite their chronic condition. To understand essential nursing care, it is important to recognize and appreciate the issues that people with chronic illness and their families contend with and manage, often on a daily basis (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>). Ultimately the course of the chronic illness and its outcomes, including end-of-life decisions, are determined in large part by the patient and family.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people with chronic disease or chronic illness must face an additional challenge: the need to deal with more than one chronic condition at a time (CDC, 2019b; Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2018). The symptoms or treatment of a second chronic condition may aggravate the first chronic condition. Patients need to be able to deal with their various chronic conditions separately as well as in combination and to coordinate the health care and directions they receive, often from more than one health care professional.</p>
<p class="indent">Often challenging for many people with chronic illness is the need to hire and oversee caregivers who come into their homes to assist with ADLs and IADLs, such as shopping for food, doing laundry, housekeeping, and handling financial matters. It is difficult for many people to be in a position of hiring, supervising, and sometimes firing people who may provide them with intimate physical care. The need to balance the role of recipient of care and oversight of the person providing care may lead to blurring of role boundaries.</p>
<p class="indent">The challenges of living with and managing a chronic illness are well known, and people with chronic illnesses often report receiving inadequate care, information, services, and counseling. This provides an opportunity for nurses to assume a more active role in addressing many of the issues experienced, coordinating care, and serving as advocates for patients who need additional assistance to manage their illness while maintaining a quality of life that is acceptable to them.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s140"> <img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic illness or syndrome that has been reported in veterans who served in the U.S. military in the Gulf War following the September 11, 2001 (&#x201C;911&#x201D;) terrorist attacks (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib453">Baldwin, Rudquist, Lava-Parmele, et al., 2019</a>). Similar to GWI, the term chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) defines a set of nonspecific symptoms experienced by veterans who served in the Gulf War in 1990&#x2013;1991 and report one or more symptom lasting more than 6 months in at least two of three categories: fatigue, depressed mood and altered cognition, and musculoskeletal pain. The term, CMI, may be employed when the symptoms are moderate to severe and have no other explanation. There is speculation that GWI and CMI may be a consequence of exposure of veterans to biologic and chemical toxins during their military service. Veterans with symptoms of both GWI and CMI want and need to be taken seriously by health care professionals.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s141"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The U.S. demographic profile reflects an increased number of older adults with chronic illnesses and those with MCC. By 2060, the number of older adults is expected to more than double to 98.2 million; the number of people 85 years of age and older is expected to triple to 19.7 million. The ratio of women and men who are 65 years of age and older is 127 women for every 100 men. In 2014, there were 75.4 million baby boomers (people born between 1946 and 1964) accounting for almost one quarter of the population. Baby boomers began turning 65 years old in 2011, contributing to the increase in numbers of older adults. Most older adults have at least one chronic condition and three in every four older Americans have MCC (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">AARP, 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2018</a>). Some of the most frequently occurring conditions among older Americans are arthritis, cancer, cardiac disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment for older adults with chronic illness accounts for 66% of total U.S. health care expenditures (CDC, 2018). The cost of providing health care for a person 65 years of age or older is estimated to be three to five times higher than costs for someone younger than 65 years. Chronic conditions increase the risk for death due to influenza and pneumonia among older adults, although effective vaccines for them exist. The WHO (2017b) has issued guidelines for community-level interventions aimed at preventing declines in older people as they age.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2014, about 28% (12.6 million) of all older adults in the United States lived alone (8.8 million women, 3.8 million men). They represented 35% of older women and 19% of older men. Almost half of women aged 75 and older live <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" title="162"></span>alone; many of them live below the poverty level (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib449">Administration for Community Living, 2018</a>). The living arrangements of older adults with chronic illness have important nursing implications for preparing those who are hospitalized for discharge and for ensuring coordination of services.</p>
