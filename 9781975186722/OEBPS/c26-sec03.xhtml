<h4 class="h4" id="s953">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should educate the patient on the purpose of the diagnostic studies, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations. Trends in results are noted because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy. Various tests may be performed to identify and diagnose abnormalities that can affect the vascular structures (arteries, veins, and lymphatics).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s954">Doppler Ultrasound Flow Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When pulses cannot be reliably palpated, a handheld continuous wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound device may be used to detect the blood flow. This handheld device emits a continuous signal through the patient&#x2019;s tissues. The signals are reflected by the moving blood cells and received by the device. The filtered-output Doppler signal is then transmitted to a loudspeaker or headphones, where it can be heard for interpretation as arterial or venous signals <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page823" title="823"></span>(<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). The depth at which blood flow can be detected by Doppler is determined by the frequency (in megahertz [MHz]) it generates. The lower the frequency, the deeper the tissue penetration; a 5- to 10-MHz probe may be used to evaluate the peripheral arteries.</p>

<p class="indent">To evaluate the lower extremities, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head of the bed elevated 20 to 30 degrees; the legs are externally rotated, if possible, to permit adequate access to the medial malleolus. Acoustic water soluble gel is applied to the patient&#x2019;s skin to permit uniform transmission of the ultrasound wave. The tip of the Doppler transducer is positioned at a 45- to 60-degree angle over the expected location of the artery and angled slowly to identify arterial blood flow. Excessive pressure is avoided because severely diseased arteries can collapse with even minimal pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">The transducer can detect blood flow in advanced arterial disease states, especially if collateral circulation has developed; thus, identifying a signal indicates only the presence of blood flow. The patient&#x2019;s provider must be notified of the absence of a signal if one had been detected previously.</p>
<p class="indent">CW Doppler is more useful as a clinical tool when combined with ankle blood pressures, which are used to determine the <strong>ankle-brachial index (ABI)</strong> (see <a href="#ff26-3">Fig. 26-3</a>). The ABI is the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Zierler &#x0026; Dawson, 2016</a>). It is an objective indicator of arterial disease that allows the examiner to quantify the degree of stenosis. With increasing degrees of arterial narrowing, there is a progressive decrease in systolic pressure distal to the involved sites.</p>

<p class="indent">The first step in determining the ABI is to have the patient rest in a supine position (not seated) for approximately 5 minutes. An appropriate-sized blood pressure cuff <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page824" title="824"></span>(typically, a 10-cm cuff for an average-sized adult) is applied to the patient&#x2019;s ankle above the malleolus. After identifying an arterial signal of the posterior tibial (see <a href="#ff26-4">Fig. 26-4</a>) and dorsalis pedis arteries, the systolic pressures, are obtained in both ankles, while listening to the Doppler signal of each artery. Diastolic pressures in the ankles cannot be measured with Doppler. If pressure in these arteries cannot be obtained, pressure can be measured in the peroneal artery, which can also be assessed at the ankle.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff26-4">

<p class="indent">Doppler ultrasonography is used to measure brachial pressures in both arms. Both arms are evaluated because the patient may have an asymptomatic stenosis in the subclavian artery, causing brachial pressure on the affected side to be 15 to 20 mm Hg or more lower than systemic pressure. The abnormally low pressure should not be used for assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">To calculate the ABI, the highest systolic pressure for each ankle is divided by the higher of the two brachial systolic pressures (see <a href="#ct26-1">Chart 26-1</a>). The ABI can be computed for a patient with the following systolic pressures:</p>
<p class="UL1First"><em>Right brachial:</em> 160 mm Hg</p>
<p class="UL1Middle"><em>Left brachial:</em> 120 mm Hg</p>
<p class="UL1Middle"><em>Right posterior tibial:</em> 80 mm Hg</p>
<p class="UL1Middle"><em>Right dorsalis pedis:</em> 60 mm Hg</p>
<p class="UL1Middle"><em>Left posterior tibial:</em> 100 mm Hg</p>
<p class="UL1Last"><em>Left dorsalis pedis:</em> 120 mm Hg</p>
<p class="indent">The highest systolic pressure for each ankle (80 mm Hg for the right, 120 mm Hg for the left) would be divided by the highest brachial pressure (160 mm Hg):</p>
<p class="UL1First"><em>Right:</em> 80/160 mm Hg = 0.50 ABI</p>
<p class="UL1Last"><em>Left:</em> 120/160 mm Hg = 0.75 ABI</p>
<p class="indent">In general, systolic pressure in the ankle of a healthy person is the same or slightly higher than the brachial systolic pressure, resulting in an ABI of about 1.0 (no arterial insufficiency) (see <a href="#ct26-2">Chart 26-2</a> for ABI pressure ranges).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Implications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses should perform a baseline ABI on any patient with decreased pulses or any patient 65 years or older, especially patients with a history of diabetes or nicotine use (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1933">Gerhard-Herman, Gornik, Barrett, et al., 2016</a>). Patients who undergo an arterial intervention or surgery should have ABIs performed per their institution&#x2019;s protocols. In addition, if there is a change in the clinical status of a patient, such as a sudden cold or painful limb, an ABI should be performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to the procedure, nurses should educate patients about the indications for ABI and what to expect. Patients should be instructed to avoid use of nicotine products or drinking caffeinated beverages for at least 2 hours prior to testing (if it is done on a nonurgent basis). There may be some discomfort involved when the cuffs are inflated.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Avoiding Common Errors in Obtaining the Ankle-Brachial Index</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Take the following precautions to ensure an accurate ankle-brachial index (ABI) calculation:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Use correctly sized blood pressure (BP) cuffs.</em> To obtain accurate BP measurements, use a cuff with a bladder width at least 40% and length at least 80% of the limb circumference.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>On the nursing plan of care, document the cuff sizes used</em> (e.g., &#x201C;12-cm adult cuff used for brachial pressures; 10-cm pediatric cuff used for ankle pressures&#x201D;). This minimizes the risk of shift-to-shift discrepancies in ABIs.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Use sufficient cuff inflation.</em> To ensure complete closure of the artery and the most accurate measurements, inflate cuff 20 to 30 mm Hg beyond the point at which the last arterial signal is detected.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Do not deflate cuff too rapidly.</em> Try to maintain a deflation rate of 2 to 4 mm Hg/s for patients without arrhythmias and 2 mm Hg/s or slower for patients with arrhythmias. Deflating the cuff more rapidly may miss the patient&#x2019;s highest pressure and result in recording an erroneous (low) BP measurement.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Suspect medial calcific sclerosis any time an ABI is 1.20 or greater or ankle pressure is more than 250 mm Hg.</em> Medial calcific sclerosis is associated with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hyperparathyroidism. It produces falsely elevated ankle pressures by hardening the media of the arteries, making the vessels noncompressible.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Be suspicious of arterial pressures recorded at less than 40 mm Hg.</em> This may mean the venous signal has been mistaken for the arterial signal. If the arterial pressure, which is normally 120 mm Hg, is measured at less than 40 mm Hg, ask a colleague to double-check the readings before recording this as an arterial pressure.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s955">Exercise Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Exercise testing is used to determine how long a patient can walk and to measure the ankle systolic blood pressure in response to walking. The patient&#x2019;s brachial systolic blood pressure is obtained on each arm prior to treadmill walking. There are several exercise testing protocols; however, in most instances the patient walks on a treadmill at 1.5 mph with a 12% incline for a maximum of 5 minutes or walks with a gradual rise in speed and incline to the point of claudication. The exercise test can be modified to walking a set distance in a hallway. Most patients can complete the test unless they have significant arterial insufficiency, severe cardiac, pulmonary, or orthopedic problems, or a physical disability. A normal response is little or no drop in ankle systolic pressure after exercise. However, in a patient with true vascular claudication, the ankle pressure drops. Combining this hemodynamic information with the walking time helps to determine whether intervention is necessary. The nurse should reassure the patient that the treadmill test will not require running; rather, the test may require walking on a slight incline. In some instances cycling may be used to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s ability to walk.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s956">Duplex Ultrasonography</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Duplex ultrasonography</strong> involves B-mode grayscale imaging of the tissue, organs, and blood vessels (arterial and venous) and permits estimation of velocity changes by use of a pulsed Doppler (see <a href="#ff26-5">Fig. 26-5</a>). Color flow techniques, which can identify vessels, may be used to shorten the examination time. Duplex ultrasound may be used to determine the level and extent of venous disease as well as chronicity of the disease. Using B mode and Doppler, it is possible to image and assess blood flow, evaluate flow of the distal vessels, locate the disease (stenosis versus occlusion), and determine anatomic morphology and the hemodynamic significance of plaque causing stenosis. Duplex ultrasound findings help in planning treatment and monitoring its outcomes. The test is noninvasive and usually requires no patient preparation. Patients who undergo abdominal vascular duplex ultrasound, however, should be advised to not eat or drink (i.e., NPO status) for at least 6 hours prior to the examination to decrease production of bowel gas that can interfere with the examination. The equipment is portable, making it useful anywhere for initial diagnosis, screening, or follow-up evaluations.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s957">Computed Tomography Scanning</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Computed tomography (CT) scanning provides cross-sectional images of soft tissue and visualizes the area of volume changes to an extremity and the compartment where changes take place. CT scans of the abdomen are useful in assessing characteristics and monitoring changes within the aorta, such as an increasing aortic diameter indicating aneurysmal formation. CT of a lymphedematous arm or leg, for example, demonstrates a characteristic honeycomb pattern in the subcutaneous tissue. In multidetector-computed tomography (MDCT), a spiral CT scanner and rapid intravenous (IV) infusion of contrast agent are used to image very thin sections of the target area, and the results are configured in three dimensions so that the image can be rotated and viewed from multiple angles. The scanner&#x2019;s head moves circumferentially around the patient as the patient passes through the scanner, creating a series of overlapping images that are connected to one another in a continuous spiral. Scan times are short. However, the patient is exposed to x-rays, and a contrast agent is injected to visualize the blood vessels. The high volume of contrast agent injected into a peripheral vein may contraindicate the use of MDCT in children and patients with significantly impaired renal function (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Implications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with impaired renal function scheduled for MDCT may require preprocedural treatment to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. This may include oral or IV hydration 6 to 12 hours preprocedure or administration of sodium bicarbonate, which alkalinizes urine and protects against free radical damage. Studies do not support the use of oral and IV <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine for protection against contrast-induced nephropathy (F&#x00E4;hling, Seeliger, Patzak, et al., 2017). The nurse should encourage fluids and monitor the patient&#x2019;s urinary output post procedure, which should be at least 0.5 mL/kg/h. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury may occur within 48 to 96 hours post procedure; therefore, the nurse should follow up with the patient&#x2019;s primary provider if this occurs (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a> for discussion of acute kidney injury). Patients who have known iodine or shellfish allergies may need premedication with steroids and histamine blockers.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s958">Angiography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An arteriogram produced by angiography may be used to confirm the diagnosis of occlusive arterial disease when surgery or other interventions are considered. It involves injecting a radiopaque contrast agent directly into the arterial system to visualize the vessels. The location of a vascular obstruction or an <strong>aneurysm</strong> (abnormal dilation of a blood vessel) and the collateral circulation can be demonstrated. Typically, the patient experiences a temporary sensation of warmth as the contrast agent is injected, and local irritation may occur at the injection site. Infrequently, a patient may have an immediate or delayed allergic reaction to the iodine contained in the contrast agent. Manifestations include dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, and numbness of the extremities. Any reaction must be reported to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page826" title="826"></span>interventionist at once; treatment may include the administration of epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids. Additional procedural risks include vessel injury, acute arterial occlusion, bleeding, or contrast nephropathy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s959">Magnetic Resonance Angiography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is performed with a standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and special software programmed to isolate the blood vessels. The resulting images can be rotated and viewed from multiple angles (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Implications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">MRA is contraindicated in patients with metal implants. Prior to the MRA, the nurse should assess for the presence of any incompatible devices, such as aneurysm clips, old tattoos, which may contain trace elements (newer materials used in tattoos such as nitinol and titanium are MRI compatible), some medication patches, or a cardiac implantable electronic device. Patients with any type of cardiac implantable electronic device need to be screened to determine if they can safely undergo MRI (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1939">Indik, Gimbel, Abe, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should educate the patient regarding what to expect during and after the procedure. The patient should be prepared to lie on a cold, hard table that slides into an enclosed small tube. The nurse should inform the patient that they will hear noises, including periodic banging and popping sounds. Patients with claustrophobia may be prescribed a sedative prior to the procedure. Patients should be instructed to close their eyes before entering the tube, and to keep them closed, as this may decrease claustrophobic symptoms. Patients should be reassured that they will be provided with a panic button to press if they feel a need to stop the procedure. MRA procedures require the use of IV contrast dye; therefore, nursing implications following MRA are the same as those for MDCT (discussed in CT section).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s960">Contrast Phlebography (Venography)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Also known as venography, contrast phlebography involves injecting a radiopaque contrast agent into the venous system. If a <strong>thrombus</strong> (a blood clot within an artery or vein) exists, the x-ray image reveals an unfilled segment of vein in an otherwise completely filled vein. Injection of the contrast agent may cause brief but painful inflammation of the vein. This test is rarely performed, as duplex ultrasonography is considered the standard for diagnosing lower extremity venous thrombosis (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Zierler &#x0026; Dawson, 2016</a>). The nurse should instruct the patient that they will receive contrast dye through a peripheral vein and will be monitored for 2 hours post venogram for access site oozing or hematoma. The guidelines for nursing care following venogram are the same as those for MDCT (see earlier discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s961">Lymphoscintigraphy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lymphoscintigraphy involves injection of a radioactively labeled colloid subcutaneously in the second interdigital space. The extremity is then exercised to facilitate the uptake of the colloid by the lymphatic system, and serial images are obtained at preset intervals.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Implications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should educate the patient about what to expect. For instance, the blue dye typically used for this procedure may stain the injection site. If the patient has a lymphatic leak, as can occur with groin incisions, there may be blue drainage from the incision until the dye clears from the system, which may take several days.</p>
