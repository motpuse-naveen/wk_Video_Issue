<p class="nonindent">Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. It is the second most common cause of cancer death in American men, exceeded only by lung cancer, and is responsible for 10% of cancer-related deaths in men. Among men diagnosed with prostate cancer, 98% survive at least 5 years, 84% survive at least 10 years, and 56% survive 15 years (ACS, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Prostate cancer is common in the United States and northwestern Europe but is rare in Africa, Central America, South America, China, and other parts of Asia. African American men have a high risk of prostate cancer; furthermore, they are more than twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as men of other racial or ethnic groups. Health care providers need to offer education about prostate cancer and appropriate screening in African American men, who are at higher risk compared to all other ethnic communities (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3882">Riviere, Luterstein, Kumar, et al., 2020</a>). Health care providers should also ensure the delivery of culturally sensitive education programs and counseling about prostate cancer screening not only to the African American patient at risk for prostate cancer, but also to his friends and family (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3861">Kelly, Morgan, Connelly, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3879">Owens, Kim, &#x0026; Tavakoli, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other risk factors for prostate cancer include increasing age; the incidence of prostate cancer increases rapidly after the age of 50 years. More than 70% of cases occur in men older than 65 years. A familial predisposition may occur in men who have a father or brother previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, especially if their relatives were diagnosed at a young age. Genes that may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer include hereditary prostate cancer 1 (<em>HPC1</em>) and <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> mutations (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>). The risk of prostate cancer is also greater in men whose diet contains excessive amounts of red meat or dairy products that are high in fat (ACS, 2020). Endogenous hormones, such as androgens and estrogens, also may be associated with the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2522">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer of the prostate in its early stages rarely produces symptoms. Usually, symptoms that develop from urinary obstruction occur in advanced disease. Prostate cancer tends to vary in its course. If the cancer is large enough to encroach on the bladder neck, signs and symptoms of urinary obstruction occur (difficulty and frequency of urination, urinary retention, and decreased size and force of the urinary stream). Other symptoms may include blood in the urine or semen and painful ejaculation. Hematuria may occur if the cancer invades the urethra or bladder. Sexual dysfunction is common before the diagnosis is made.</p>
<p class="indent">Prostate cancer can spread to lymph nodes and bones. Symptoms of metastases include backache, hip pain, perineal and rectal discomfort, anemia, weight loss, weakness, nausea, oliguria (decreased urine output), and spontaneous pathologic fractures. These symptoms may be the first indications of prostate cancer.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2523">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If prostate cancer is detected early, the likelihood of cure is high (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>). It can be diagnosed through an abnormal finding with the DRE, serum PSA, and TRUS with biopsy. Detection is more likely with the use of combined diagnostic procedures. Routine repeated DRE (preferably by the same examiner) is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1756" title="1756"></span>important because early cancer may be detected as a nodule within the gland or as an extensive hardening in the posterior lobe. The more advanced lesion is &#x201C;stony hard&#x201D; and fixed. DRE also provides useful clinical information about the rectum, anal sphincter, and quality of stool.</p>
<p class="indent">The diagnosis of prostate cancer is confirmed by a histologic examination of tissue removed surgically by TURP, open prostatectomy, or ultrasound-guided transrectal needle biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration is a quick, painless method of obtaining prostate cells for cytologic examination and determining the stage of disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Most prostate cancers are detected when a man seeks medical attention for symptoms of urinary obstruction or are found by routine DRE and PSA testing. Cancer detected incidentally when TURP is performed for clinically benign disease and lower urinary tract symptoms occurs in about 1 of 10 cases.</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt">DRE and PSA testing are important screening procedures because abnormal DRE and elevated levels of PSA may raise suspicion of prostate cancer. However, a diagnosis of cancer requires confirmation with a prostate biopsy.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent1">TRUS helps detect nonpalpable prostate cancers and assists with staging of localized prostate cancer. Needle biopsies of the prostate are commonly guided by TRUS. The biopsies are examined by a pathologist to both determine if cancer is present and to grade the tumor. The most commonly used tumor grading system is the Gleason score. This system assigns a grade of 1 to 5 for the most predominant architectural pattern of the glands of the prostate and a secondary grade of 1 to 5 to the second most predominant pattern. The Gleason score is then reported as, for example, 2 + 4; the combined value can range from 2 to 10. With each increase in Gleason score, there is an increase in tumor aggressiveness. Lower Gleason scores indicate well-differentiated and less aggressive tumor cells; higher Gleason scores indicate undifferentiated cells and more aggressive cancer. A total score of 8 to 10 indicates a high-grade cancer (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Smith et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3891">Zhou, Salles, Samarska, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Categorization of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer is determined by the extent of cancer in the prostate gland, whether or not the cancer is localized to the prostate, the aggressiveness of the cells, and the spread to the lymph nodes and beyond. Level of risk, in turn, is used to determine treatment options.</p>
<p class="indent">Bone scans, skeletal x-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to identify metastatic bone disease. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans may be performed to determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. The radiolabeled monoclonal antibody capromab pendetide with indium 111 is an antibody that can be used to detect either recurrent prostate cancer at low PSA levels or metastatic disease (NCCN, 2020b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2524">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment is based on the patient&#x2019;s life expectancy, symptoms, risk of recurrence after definitive treatment, size of the tumor, Gleason score, PSA level, likelihood of complications, and patient preference. Therapy is often guided by the use of a nomogram or risk stratification scheme suggested by the NCCN (2020b) clinical practice guidelines. A multidisciplinary team approach is essential for the development of appropriate treatment. Management may be nonsurgical and involve watchful waiting or be surgical and entail prostatectomy. Nursing care of the patient with cancer of the prostate is summarized in <a href="#ct53-3">Chart&#x00A0;53-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with prostate cancer who choose nonsurgical watchful waiting, this approach involves actively monitoring the course of disease and intervening only if the cancer progresses or if symptoms warrant other intervention. It is an option for patients with life expectancy of less than 5 years and low-risk cancers. Advantages include absence of side effects of more aggressive treatment, improved quality of life, avoidance of unnecessary treatment, and decreased initial costs. Disadvantages include missed chance at cure, risk of metastasis, subsequent need for more aggressive treatment, anxiety about living with untreated cancer, and need for frequent monitoring (NCCN, 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Therapeutic</em> vaccines kill existing cancer cells and provide long-lasting immunity against further cancer development. Sipuleucel-T is the first therapeutic cancer vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in men with metastatic prostate cancer that is no longer responding to hormone therapy. This is an immunotherapy treatment that stimulates the patient&#x2019;s own immune system to identify and target prostate cancer cells, and it has minimal side effects (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3850">Caram, Ross, Lin, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, two other medications, abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel, are treatment options for patients requiring care for the management of metastatic castration&#x2013;resistant prostate cancer, which does not respond to sipuleucel-T or the usual treatment options (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3877">Nuhn, De Bono, Fizazi, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radical prostatectomy is considered first-line treatment for prostate cancer and is used with patients whose tumor is confined to the prostate (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Smith et al., 2019</a>). It is the complete surgical removal of the prostate, seminal vesicles, tips of the vas deferens, and often the surrounding fat, nerves, and blood vessels. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy have become the standard surgical approaches for localized cancer of the prostate. Although erectile dysfunction is a common side effect, these laparoscopic radical prostatectomy approaches result in low morbidity and more favorable postoperative outcomes, including improved quality of life and less sexual dysfunction if the nerves are spared. Surgical approaches are discussed in detail later in this chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radiation Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Two major forms of radiation therapy are used to treat cancer of the prostate: teletherapy (external) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;brachytherapy:&lt;/b&gt; delivery of radiation therapy through internal implants placed inside or adjacent to the tumor">brachytherapy</button></strong> (internal). Teletherapy (external-beam radiation therapy [EBRT]) is prescribed by the radiation oncologist for a total dose over a certain time frame&#x2014;for example, 28 treatments over 5&#x00BD; weeks (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>). It is a treatment option for patients with low-risk prostate cancer; progression-free survival is similar to that of low-risk patients treated with radical prostatectomy. Patients with intermediate- and high-risk cancers receive higher doses of EBRT. They may also be candidates for both pelvic lymph node irradiation and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;androgen deprivation therapy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical (orchiectomy) or medical castration (e.g., with luteinizing hormone&#x2013;releasing hormone agonists)">androgen deprivation therapy</button></strong> that entails surgical (orchiectomy) or medical castration (e.g., with luteinizing hormone&#x2013;releasing hormone agonists) (NCCN, 2020b). Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is one method of delivery of EBRT. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy sets a dose for the target volume and restricts the dose to surrounding tissue. Another approach to delivery of radiation uses a computer-controlled robotic arm to deliver a course of radiotherapy (i.e., stereotactic radiosurgery) to localized prostate cancer. This method, referred to as the CyberKnife, is considered a safe and reliable method of delivering radiation to treat prostate cancer (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3838">Pollom, Wang, Gibbs, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent1">Brachytherapy involves the implantation of interstitial radioactive seeds under anesthesia. It has become a commonly used monotherapy treatment option for early, clinically organ-confined prostate cancer. The surgeon uses ultrasound guidance to place 80 to 100 seeds (depending on the prostate volume), and the patient returns home after the procedure. Exposure of others to radiation is minimal, but the patient should avoid close contact with pregnant women and infants for up to 2 months. Radiation safety guidelines include straining urine for seeds and using a condom during penile-vaginal intercourse for 2 weeks after implantation to catch any seeds that pass through the urethra. This approach can be completed in 1 day, with little lost time from normal activities. Brachytherapy may be combined with EBRT with or without neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for patients considered at intermediate risk. High-risk patients are considered poor candidates for permanent brachytherapy (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although cure rates with radiation are comparable to those of radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy possesses its own unique set of side effects, which differ depending on the method of radiation administration. Patients receiving EBRT or brachytherapy may experience inflammation of the rectum, bowel, and bladder (proctitis, enteritis, and cystitis) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1761" title="1761"></span>because of the proximity of these structures to the prostate and the radiation doses. Inflammation and mucosal loss at the bladder neck, prostate, and urethra can cause acute urinary dysfunction. Both irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms can cause pain with urination and ejaculation until the irritation subsides. Rectal urgency, diarrhea, and tenesmus may occur as a result of radiation of the anterior rectal wall. Late side effects include rectal proctitis, bleeding, and rectal fistula; painless hematuria; chronic interstitial cystitis; urethral stricture erectile dysfunction; and, rarely, secondary cancers of the rectum and bladder (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hormonal Strategies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The number of survivors of prostate cancer in the United States is estimated at 2 million; approximately one third of these men currently receive androgen deprivation therapy (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3857">Jeong, Cowan, Broering, et al., 2019</a>). Androgen deprivation therapy is commonly used to suppress androgenic stimuli to the prostate by decreasing the level of circulating plasma testosterone or interrupting the conversion to or binding of DHT. As a result, the prostatic epithelium atrophies (decreases in size). This effect is accomplished either by surgical castration through bilateral <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orchiectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of one or both testes">orchiectomy</button></strong> (removal of one or both testes), which has traditionally been the mainstay of hormonal treatment, or by medical castration with the administration of medications, such as luteinizing hormone&#x2013;releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. Bilateral orchiectomy decreases plasma testosterone levels significantly because approximately 93% of circulating testosterone is of testicular origin (7% is from the adrenal glands). Thus, the testicular stimulus required for continued prostatic growth is removed, resulting in prostatic atrophy.</p>
<p class="indent">However, orchiectomy often results in significant morbidity. Although the procedure does not cause the side effects associated with other hormonal therapies (described later), it is associated with considerable emotional impact. Because patients who have prostate cancer are living longer with the disease, health care providers are focusing on effective therapeutic modalities that promote an acceptable quality of life. Patients may be given the option for testicular prostheses to be placed during surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">LHRH agonists include leuprolide and goserelin. Additional hormonal manipulation with antiandrogens may be prescribed for patients who do not show adequate serum testosterone suppression (less than 50 ng/mL) with medical or surgical castration. Antiandrogen receptor antagonists include flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide. LHRH agonists suppress testicular androgen, whereas antiandrogen receptor antagonists cause adrenal androgen suppression. When LHRH agonists are initiated, a testosterone flare may occur, causing pain in bony metastatic disease. Antiandrogens given for the first 7 days may reduce this uncomfortable symptom. The most common uses of LHRH agonists are in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting in combination with radiation therapy, after radical prostatectomy, and in the treatment of recurrence indicated by an elevation in the PSA but without clinical or x-ray evidence. Medical and surgical castration causes hot flushing because these treatment modalities increase hypothalamic activity, which stimulates the thermoregulatory centers of the body (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3864">Kunath, Goebell, Wullich, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3885">Shore, Guerrero, Sanahuja, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The management of hormone-refractory prostate cancer remains somewhat controversial. Another category of medication used as a second-line hormonal intervention is the adrenal ablating drugs. Ketoconazole is used to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are required for the synthesis of androgens and other steroids. High-dose ketoconazole lowers testosterone by decreasing both testicular and endocrine production of androgen. Administration of this medication requires steroid supplementation to prevent adrenal insufficiency.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypogonadism is responsible for the adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy, which include vasomotor flushing, loss of libido, decreased bone density (resulting in osteoporosis and fractures), anemia, fatigue, increased fat mass, lipid alterations, decreased muscle mass, gynecomastia (increased breast tissue), and mastodynia (breast/nipple tenderness). Hypogonadism is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, resulting from insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Chemotherapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Recent studies have shown clear benefits in terms of survival with chemotherapy treatment that includes a docetaxel-based regimen for non&#x2013;androgen-dependent prostate cancer (NCCN, 2020b). Other studies are under way to determine the importance of the vascular endothelial growth factor system. Tumor angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth, including growth of prostate carcinomas and other high-grade cancers. Therefore, antiangiogenic treatment in combination with conventional therapies may play a future role in treatment. Gene-based therapy in prostate cancer is an emerging and promising adjuvant to conventional treatment strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">Possible complications related to chemotherapy are specific to the type of chemotherapy given (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#ct12-4">Chart&#x00A0;12-4</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Therapies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cryosurgery of the prostate is used to ablate prostate cancer in patients who cannot tolerate surgery and in those with recurrent prostate cancer. Transperineal probes are inserted into the prostate under ultrasound guidance to freeze the tissue directly.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping the urethral passage patent may require repeated TURPs. If this is impractical, catheter drainage is instituted by way of the suprapubic or transurethral route. For men with advanced prostate cancer, palliative measures are indicated. Although cure is unlikely with advanced prostate cancer, many men survive for long periods, free of debilitating symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Bone lesions that result from metastasis of prostate cancer can be very painful and result in pathologic fractures. Opioid and nonopioid medications are used to control bone pain. EBRT can be delivered to skeletal lesions to relieve pain. Radiopharmaceuticals, such as strontium or samarium, can be injected IV to treat multiple sites of bone metastasis. Antiandrogen therapies are used in an effort to reduce the circulating androgens. If antiandrogen therapies are not effective, medications such as prednisone have been effective in reducing pain and improving quality of life (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3852">Dong, Zieren, Xue, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Sargon, Lamb, &#x0026; Patel, 2019</a>). Bisphosphonate therapy with pamidronate can be given to reduce the risk of pathologic fracture. In advanced prostate cancer, blood transfusions are given to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels when bone marrow is replaced by tumor.</p>
<p class="indent">More <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1762" title="1762"></span>than one third of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer elect to use some form of complementary and integrative health. Because research on many forms of complementary, alternative, and integrative health is lacking, patients often rely on anecdotal information to make decisions about which modalities to use. Nurses and other health care professionals play a vital role in assisting patients to locate and evaluate available information about these practices to ensure that harmful forms are avoided (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>). The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website can assist nurses in providing patients with evidence-based information (see the Resources section at the end of the chapter).</p>
