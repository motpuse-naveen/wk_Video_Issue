<h4 class="h4" id="s807">The Electrocardiogram</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The electrical impulse that travels through the heart can be viewed by means of electrocardiography, the end product of which is an <strong>electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong>. Each phase of the cardiac cycle is reflected by specific waveforms on the screen of a cardiac monitor or on a strip of ECG graph paper.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s808">Obtaining an Electrocardiogram</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An ECG is obtained by placing electrodes on the body at specific areas. Biomonitoring electrodes come in various <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page692" title="692"></span>shapes and sizes, but all have two components: (1) an adhesive substance that attaches to the skin to secure the electrode in place and (2) a substance that reduces the skin&#x2019;s electrical impedance, facilitating the transfer of ions from the tissue to electrons in the electrode, enhancing conductivity. Gently abrading the skin with a clean dry gauze pad or sandpaper edge of the electrode helps to expose the inner conductive layer of epidermis, which will reduce skin impedance. Although cleansing the skin with alcohol removes any oily residue from the skin, it also increases the skin&#x2019;s electrical impedance and hinders detection of the cardiac electrical signal. Washing the area with soap and water prior to electrode placement is recommended. If the amount of chest hair prevents the electrode from having good contact with the skin, the hair may need to be clipped (Sendelbach &#x0026; Jepsen, 2018; see Chapter&#x00A0;21, <a href="c21-sec03.xhtml#ct21-5">Chart&#x00A0;21-5</a>: Applying Electrodes). Poor electrode adhesion will cause significant <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;artifact:&lt;/b&gt; distorted, irrelevant, and extraneous electrocardiographic (ECG) waveforms">artifact</button></strong> (distorted, irrelevant, and extraneous ECG waveforms), which may distort capturing an accurate ECG waveform.</p>

The heart conducts electrical activity, which the ECG measures and shows. The configurations of electrical activity displayed on the ECG vary depending on the lead (or view) of the ECG and on the rhythm of the heart. Therefore, the configuration of a normal rhythm tracing from lead I will differ from the configuration of a normal rhythm tracing from lead II, lead II will differ from lead III, and so on. The same is true for abnormal rhythms and cardiac disorders. To make an accurate assessment of the heart&#x2019;s electrical activity or to identify where, when, and what abnormalities occur, the ECG needs to be evaluated from every lead, not just from lead II. Here the different areas of electrical activity are identified by color. RA, right arm; LA, left arm; SA, sinoatrial; AV, atrioventricular; LL, left leg.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The number and placement site of the electrodes depend on the type of ECG being obtained. Most continuous monitors use 2 to 5 electrodes, usually placed on the limbs and the chest. These electrodes create an imaginary line, called a <em>lead,</em> which serves as a reference point from which the electrical activity is viewed. A lead is like an eye of a camera&#x2014;it has a narrow peripheral field of vision, looking only at the electrical activity directly in front of it. Therefore, the ECG waveforms that appear on the ECG paper and cardiac monitor represent the electrical impulse in relation to the lead (see <a href="#ff22-1">Fig.&#x00A0;22-1</a>). A change in the waveform can be caused by a change in the electrical impulse (where it originates or how it is conducted) or by a change in the lead. Electrodes are attached to cable wires, which are connected to one of the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>An ECG machine placed at the patient&#x2019;s side for an immediate recording (standard 12-lead ECG)</span></li>
<li><span>A cardiac monitor at the patient&#x2019;s bedside for continuous reading; this kind of monitoring, usually called <em>hardwire monitoring,</em> is used in intensive care units</span></li>
<li><span>A small box that the patient carries and that continuously transmits the ECG information by radiowaves to a central monitor located elsewhere (called <em>telemetry</em>)</span></li>
<li><span>A small, lightweight tape recorder&#x2013;like machine (called <em>continuous ECG monitoring</em>, which might include a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page693" title="693"></span><em>Holter monitor</em> or a <em>patch monitor</em>) that the patient wears for a prescribed period of time and that continuously records the ECG, which is later viewed and analyzed with a scanner</span></li>
<li><span>A very small device inserted under the skin or worn externally on a wrist band (called <em>intermittent monitoring</em> using a <em>looped recorder</em>) can perform ECG monitoring on demand whenever a patient is symptomatic (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> for further discussion of ECG monitoring systems)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">A patient may undergo an electrophysiology study (EPS) in which electrodes are placed inside the heart in order to obtain an intracardiac ECG. This is used not only to diagnose the arrhythmia but also to determine the most effective treatment plan. However, because an EPS is invasive, it is performed in the hospital and may require that the patient be admitted (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">During open heart surgery, temporary pacemaker wires may be lightly sutured to the epicardium and brought through the chest wall. These wires may be used not only for temporary pacing but also, when connected to the V lead cable, to obtain an atrial ECG, which can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">The placement of electrodes for monitoring varies with the type of technology, the purpose of monitoring, and the protocols used in the health care facility. For a standard 12-lead ECG, 10 electrodes (6 on the chest and 4 on the limbs) are placed on the body (see <a href="#ff22-2">Fig.&#x00A0;22-2</a>). To prevent interference from the electrical activity of skeletal muscle, the limb electrodes are placed on areas that are not bony and that do not have significant movement. The limb electrodes provide the first six leads: leads I, II, III, aVR (augmented voltage right arm), aVL (augmented voltage left arm), and aVF (augmented voltage left leg/foot). The 6 chest electrodes are applied to the chest at very specific areas. The chest electrodes provide the V or precordial leads, V<sub>1</sub> through V<sub>6</sub>. To locate the fourth intercostal space and the placement of V<sub>1</sub>, the sternal angle and then the sternal notch, which is about 1 or 2 inches below the sternal angle, are located. When the fingers are moved to the patient&#x2019;s immediate right, the second rib can be palpated. The second intercostal space is the indentation felt just below the second rib. Locating the specific intercostal space is critical for the correct placement of each chest electrode. Errors in diagnosis can occur if electrodes are incorrectly placed. Sometimes, when a patient in the hospital needs to be monitored more closely for ECG changes, the chest electrodes are left in place to ensure the same placement for follow-up 12-lead ECGs.</p>
<p class="indent">A standard 12-lead ECG reflects the electrical activity primarily in the left ventricle. Placement of additional electrodes for other leads may be needed to obtain more complete information. For example, in patients with suspected right-sided heart damage, right-sided precordial leads are required to evaluate the right ventricle (see <a href="#ff22-2">Fig.&#x00A0;22-2</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s809">Components of the Electrocardiogram</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The ECG waveform reflects the function of the heart&#x2019;s conduction system in relation to the specific lead. The ECG offers important information about the electrical activity of the heart and is useful in diagnosing arrhythmias. ECG waveforms are printed on graph paper that is divided by vertical and horizontal lines at standard intervals (see <a href="#ff22-3">Fig.&#x00A0;22-3</a>). Time and rate are measured on the horizontal axis of the graph, and amplitude or voltage is measured on the vertical axis. When an ECG waveform moves toward the top of the paper, it is called a <em>positive deflection.</em> When it moves toward the bottom of the paper, it is called a <em>negative deflection.</em> When reviewing an ECG, each waveform should be examined and compared with the others.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Waves, Complexes, and Intervals</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ECG is composed of waveforms (including the P wave, the QRS complex, the T wave, and possibly a U wave) and of segments and intervals (including the PR interval, the ST segment, and the QT interval) (see <a href="#ff22-3">Fig.&#x00A0;22-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;P wave:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects conduction of an electrical impulse through the atrium; atrial depolarization">P wave</button></strong> represents the electrical impulse starting in the SA node and spreading through the atria. Therefore, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page694" title="694"></span>P wave represents atrial depolarization. It is normally 2.5 mm or less in height and 0.11 seconds or less in duration.</p>

<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;QRS complex:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects conduction of an electrical impulse through the ventricles; ventricular depolarization">QRS complex</button></strong> represents ventricular depolarization. Not all QRS complexes have all three waveforms. The Q wave is the first negative deflection after the P wave. The Q wave is normally less than 0.04 seconds in duration and less than 25% of the R-wave amplitude. The R wave is the first positive deflection after the P wave, and the S wave is the first negative deflection after the R wave. When a wave is less than 5 mm in height, small letters (q, r, s) are used; when a wave is taller than 5 mm, capital letters (Q, R, S) are used to label the waves. The QRS complex is normally less than 0.12 seconds in duration.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;T wave:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects repolarization of the ventricles">T wave</button></strong> represents ventricular repolarization (when the cells regain a negative charge; also called the <em>resting state</em>). It follows the QRS complex and is usually the same direction (deflection) as the QRS complex. Atrial repolarization also occurs but is not visible on the ECG because it occurs at the same time as ventricular depolarization (i.e., the QRS).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;U wave:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that may reflect Purkinje fiber repolarization; usually, it is not seen unless a patient&#x2019;s serum potassium level is low">U wave</button></strong> is thought to represent repolarization of the Purkinje fibers; although this wave is rare, it sometimes appears in patients with hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hypertension, or heart disease. If present, the U wave follows the T wave and is usually smaller than the P wave. If larger in amplitude, it may be mistaken for an extra P wave.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;PR interval:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects conduction of an electrical impulse from the sinoatrial node through the atrioventricular node">PR interval</button></strong> is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex and represents the time needed for sinus node stimulation, atrial depolarization, and conduction through the AV node before ventricular depolarization. In adults, the PR interval normally ranges from 0.12 to 0.20 seconds in duration.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ST segment:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects the end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave">ST segment</button></strong>, which represents early ventricular repolarization, lasts from the end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave. The beginning of the ST segment is usually identified by a change in the thickness or angle of the terminal portion of the QRS complex. The end of the ST segment may be more difficult to identify because it merges into the T wave. The ST segment is normally isoelectric (see later discussion of TP interval). It is analyzed to identify whether it is above or below the isoelectric line, which may be, among other signs and symptoms, a sign of cardiac ischemia (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;QT interval:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects the time from ventricular depolarization through repolarization">QT interval</button></strong>, which represents the total time for ventricular depolarization and repolarization, is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The QT interval varies with heart rate, gender, and age; therefore, the measured interval may be corrected (QT<sub>c</sub>) for these variables through specific calculations. The QT<sub>c</sub> may be automatically calculated by the ECG technology, or a nurse may manually calculate or use a resource that contains a chart of these calculations. The QT interval is usually 0.32 to 0.40 seconds in duration if the heart rate is 65 to 95 bpm. Many medications commonly given in the hospital can cause prolongation of the QT interval (QT<sub>c</sub>), placing the patient at risk for a lethal ventricular arrhythmia called <em>torsades de pointes.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;TP interval:&lt;/b&gt; the part of an ECG that reflects the time between the end of the T wave and the beginning of the next P wave; used to identify the isoelectric line">TP interval</button></strong> is measured from the end of the T wave to the beginning of the next P wave&#x2014;an isoelectric period (see <a href="#ff22-3">Fig.&#x00A0;22-3</a>). When no electrical activity is detected, the line on the graph remains flat; this is called the <em>isoelectric line.</em> The ST segment is compared with the TP interval to detect ST segment changes. The PR segment is sometimes used to determine the isoelectric line. However, because the PR segment sometimes is altered due to ischemic conditions, the TP interval is the preferred reference for the isoelectric line.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;PP interval:&lt;/b&gt; the duration between the beginning of one P wave and the beginning of the next P wave; used to calculate atrial rate and rhythm">PP interval</button></strong> is measured from the beginning of one P wave to the beginning of the next P wave. The PP interval is used to determine atrial rate and rhythm. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;RR interval:&lt;/b&gt; the duration between the beginning of one QRS complex and the beginning of the next QRS complex; used to calculate ventricular rate and rhythm">RR interval</button></strong> is measured from one QRS complex to the next QRS complex. The RR interval is used to determine ventricular rate and rhythm (see later discussion).</p>
