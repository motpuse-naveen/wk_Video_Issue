<h4 class="h4a" id="s3193">EMERGENCY NURSING AND THE CONTINUUM OF CARE</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A key principle underlying emergency care is that the patient is rapidly assessed, treated, and referred to the appropriate setting for ongoing care. This makes the ED a temporary point on the continuum of care. In 2017, only 10.4% of patients who received care in an ED in the United States were admitted to the hospital, which means emergency nurses must plan and facilitate the patient&#x2019;s safe discharge and follow-up care in the home, community, and the transitional care environment (CDC, 2017a).</p>
