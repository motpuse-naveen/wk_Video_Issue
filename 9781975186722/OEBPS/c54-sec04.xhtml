<p class="nonindent">Nurses should strive to create a welcoming, inclusive, and therapeutic relationship with every patient. To better achieve this type of relationship with people who are LGBTQ, nurses should use inclusive terms and language. This will increase the likelihood of eliciting accurate information from anyone whose experience is different from cultural norms (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Eliason &#x0026; Chinn, 2018</a>). Using inclusive language conveys to the person who is LGBTQ that the interviewer is open to hearing about their sexuality, gender identity, and relationships. If a nurse does not yet know a patient&#x2019;s sexual orientation and gender identity, they should always use neutral language to ensure the patient is comfortable during the assessment (see the Resources section at the end of the chapter for educational materials that promote developing welcoming and inclusive patient&#x2013;provider relationships).</p>

<p class="indent">In the United States, people tend to communicate using a binary gender system (female or male) and based on the assumption that people are heterosexual. This type of communication practice can be harmful to people who are LGBTQ, especially in the health care setting. Nurses should strive to use language terms that avoid assumptions about a patient&#x2019;s gender identity and sexual orientation. For example, nurses should avoid using singular <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;third-person pronouns:&lt;/b&gt; a way of referencing a person other than the self that may or may not use gender-specific labels (e.g., he/him, she/her, they/them)">third-person pronouns</button></strong> (a way of referencing a person other than the self that may use gender-specific labels) and salutations that use gender-specific labels (e.g., sir/miss/madam, Mr./Mrs./Ms.) until confirming the patient&#x2019;s preferences. They should also avoid using terms that assume sexual orientation of the patient and their family (e.g., wife/husband, boyfriend/girlfriend, mother/father). <a href="#tt54-1">Table&#x00A0;54-1</a> provides specific examples of neutral questions and statements.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should routinely assess each patient&#x2019;s sexual orientation and gender identity (SO/GI), including preferred pronouns. In fact, national and federal recommendations for routine collection of SO/GI in health care settings have spanned nearly 20 years (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3937">Maragh-Bass, Torain, Adler, et al., 2017</a>). Assessing for SO/GI in the health care setting facilitates the provision of enhanced, holistic, person-centered care. For example, people who are LGBTQ may have unique health risks that need attention or may have a diverse family structure. People who are LGBTQ typically want to disclose their SO/GI to health care professionals. However, most health care professionals do not ask about SO/GI and instead make assumptions about a patient&#x2019;s gender identity and presume every patient is heterosexual. These assumptions put the burden on the patient to disclose (&#x201C;come out&#x201D; about their SO/GI), putting them in a vulnerable position (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Eliason &#x0026; Chinn, 2018</a>). Thus, nurses should be skilled at properly assessing for SO/GI and preferred pronouns (<a href="#ct54-1">Chart&#x00A0;54-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessing for family structure and other important relationships should be routine for every patient. People who are LGBTQ may have diverse or nontraditional family structures and may include people who are not biologically related. Nurses should assess for family and family of choice. Family of choice is a commonly used term among people who are LGBTQ. Some people who are LGBTQ have been rejected by their family of origin and thus create their own family network of people who support and care for them (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Eliason &#x0026; Chinn, 2018</a>). Moreover, some people who are LGBTQ fear discrimination and exclusion of not only themselves but also their family. This is especially true of people who live in states that sanction narrow definitions of legal relationships (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Eliason &#x0026; Chinn, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong><strong>Personal Information</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse introduces these assessment questions by stating:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>&#x201C;I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1784" title="1784"></span>am going to ask you a few questions about your sexual orientation and gender identity so we can provide personalized and affirmative care to you. These are questions I ask every patient. If you do not feel comfortable answering these questions, we can skip them.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse assesses for gender identity using a two-step question:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>&#x201C;What sex was listed on your birth certificate?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>&#x201C;What is your current gender identity?&#x201D; or &#x201C;How do you describe your gender identity?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Assessing for pronouns:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>&#x201C;What pronouns do you prefer we use?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the patient is unsure of what this means, you can ask, &#x201C;Do you use the pronouns he/him, she/her, or something else?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Assessing sexual orientation:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>&#x201C;What is your sexual orientation?&#x201D; or &#x201C;How do you describe your sexual orientation?&#x201D;</p>

<p class="indent">Nurses should use neutral terms and be sensitive when interviewing all people about their family structure. Since some people who are LGBTQ have nontraditional family structures and families of choice, it is best to start the interview with an open-ended question, such as &#x201C;Tell me about your family and social support system.&#x201D; As the nurse asks follow-up questions, neutral terms should be used when inquiring about partners/significant others and parents/guardians (examples are listed in <a href="#tt54-1">Table&#x00A0;54-1</a>). Also, the nurse should not assume a person who is LGBTQ does not have children. Many people who are LGBTQ have children through adoption, surrogacy, and previous relationships. If the patient has children, the nurse should avoid making assumptions about the family structure. Finally, the nurse should mirror the language and terms used by the patient and their family. For example, if a male-identifying patient refers to his significant other as &#x201C;husband,&#x201D; the nurse should not choose to use a different term, such as &#x201C;partner.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">In terms of health assessment, people who are LGBTQ typically do not require specific assessments or diagnostic tests. They should receive nursing and medical person-centered care like any other patient. Depending on the health care setting, the nurse may want to focus parts of their assessment on those health risks mentioned earlier in the chapter. Time could be spent asking the person who is LGBTQ about anxiety, depression, suicidality, and discrimination and victimization. Since gay and bisexual men and transgender women have higher rates of HIV, sexual activity, safe sex practices, and HIV status should be assessed. People who identify as transgender should be asked about hormone treatment and surgical procedures only if it is relevant to the care being provided.</p>

<p class="nonindent">In understanding older adults who are LGBTQ, it is important to recognize their social, historical, and cultural experiences. The lived experience of older adults who are LGBTQ is vastly different than younger people who are LGBTQ. Older adults who are LGBTQ lived their younger years in stigmatizing and dangerous environments (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3907">Ducheny, Hardacker, Claybren, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). They frequently experienced discrimination and abuse in multiple areas, including physical, mental, and verbal abuse (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Witten &#x0026; Eyler, 2016</a>). For many decades, it was dangerous for people who were LGBTQ to &#x201C;come out&#x201D; (disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity) and extremely difficult to find affirming health care services. Before the 1960s, people who identified as transgender were often committed to psychiatric institutions or forced to live in seclusion. From 1960 through 1990, people who identified as transgender could access rigid and isolating treatment and were made to adhere to narrow requirements (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Ducheny et al., 2019</a>). Until 1973, homosexuality was a diagnosed psychiatric mental illness. Moreover, older people who are LGBTQ faced significant discrimination that was sanctioned by state and federal governments. This history has profoundly affected the way in which older adults who are LGBTQ view and access all facets of health care, including clinics, hospitals, and assisted living/nursing homes (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3971">Witten &#x0026; Eyler, 2016</a>). To care for and promote the health of older adults who are LGBTQ, nurses should be mindful and understanding of this background. Moreover, this amplifies the importance of nurses needing to always provide a safe and welcoming space for all patients that promotes human dignity. Older adults who have hidden their sexual orientation or gender identity for many years due to fears of discrimination will be more likely to disclose this information if the nurse uses language and questions that signals to the patient that they are accepting and safe.</p>
