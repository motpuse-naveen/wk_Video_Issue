<h4 class="h4" id="s830">Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)</strong> is an electronic device that detects and terminates life-threatening episodes of tachycardia or fibrillation, especially those that are ventricular in origin. Patients at high risk of VT or ventricular fibrillation and who would benefit from an ICD are those who have survived sudden cardiac death, which usually is caused by ventricular fibrillation, or have experienced spontaneous, symptomatic VT (syncope secondary to VT) not due to a reversible cause (called a <em>secondary prevention intervention</em>). Patients with coronary artery disease who are 40 days postacute MI with moderate to severe LV dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) are at risk of sudden cardiac death and therefore an ICD is indicated (called a <em>primary prevention intervention</em>). An ICD implantation is also recommended in patients who have been diagnosed with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy for at least 9 months and have functional NYHA Class II or III heart failure (<a href="#bib1735">Wilkoff, Fauchier, Stiles, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>) (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, <a href="c25-sec01.xhtml#tt25-1">Table&#x00A0;25-1</a>) (<a href="#bib1695">Al-khatib et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1741">Ganz, 2019</a>).</p>

Courtesy of ZOLL LifeVest.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Because there may be a waiting period for ICD implantation, especially those postacute MI, patients who are at risk for sudden cardiac death may be prescribed a wearable vestlike automated defibrillator, which works just like an AED in that a shock is delivered less than a minute after a life-threatening rhythm is detected (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2019; see <a href="#ff22-28">Fig.&#x00A0;22-28</a>). Prior to the delivery of the shock, the vest vibrates and issues an alarm to announce that a shock is imminent. The vest weighs about a pound, is worn under the patient&#x2019;s clothing, and is attached <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page720" title="720"></span>to a monitor with a battery that is worn in a holster or on a shoulder strap. The monitor automatically downloads information once a day, usually in the middle of the night. The vest must be worn at all times, even if the patient is admitted to the hospital and placed on an ECG monitor, and removed only when showering or bathing. The battery needs to be changed every day. Education is provided to the patient by the device manufacturer. However, the nurse should assess the patient&#x2019;s understanding of the education provided and explore any issues that may prevent the patient from wearing it.</p>
<p class="indent">An ICD has a generator about the size of a pack of chewing gum that is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket, usually in the upper chest wall. An ICD also has at least an RV lead that is implanted transvenously and can sense intrinsic electrical activity and deliver an electrical impulse. The implantation procedure, postimplantation care, and length of hospital stay are much like those for insertion of a pacemaker (see <a href="#ff22-29">Fig.&#x00A0;22-29</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">ICDs are designed to respond to two criteria: a rate that exceeds a predetermined level and a change in the isoelectric line segments. When an arrhythmia occurs, rate sensors require a set duration of time to sense the arrhythmia. Then, the device automatically charges; after a second &#x201C;look&#x201D; confirms the arrhythmia, it delivers the programmed charge through the lead to the heart. The time from arrhythmia detection to electrical discharge depends on the charging time, which depends on the programmed energy level (<a href="#bib1693">Zipes et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). However, in an ICD that has the capability of providing atrial therapies, the device can be programmed to be activated by the patient, giving the patient time to activate the charge at a time and place of their choosing. The life of the lithium battery is about 9 years but varies depending on the use of the ICD. ICD surveillance is similar to that of the pacemaker; however, it includes stored endocardial ECGs as well as information about the number and frequency of shocks that have been delivered.</p>

<img src="images/ff22-29.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff22-29.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;22-29 &#x2022;</span> The implantable cardioverter defibrillator consists of a generator and a sensing/pacing/defibrillating electrode.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Antiarrhythmic medication may be given with this technology to minimize the occurrence of a tachyarrhythmia and to reduce the frequency of ICD discharge.</p>
<p class="indent">Several types of devices are available. ICD, the generic name, is used as the abbreviation for these various devices. Each device offers a different delivery sequence, but all are capable of delivering high-energy (high-intensity) defibrillation to treat a tachycardia (atrial or ventricular).</p>
<p class="indent">Some ICDs can respond with (1) antitachycardia pacing, in which the device delivers electrical impulses at a fast rate in an attempt to disrupt the tachycardia, (2) low-energy (low-intensity) cardioversion, or (3) defibrillation; others may use all three techniques. Pacing is used to terminate tachycardias caused by a conduction disturbance called <em>reentry,</em> which is repetitive restimulation of the heart by the same impulse. An impulse or a series of impulses is delivered to the heart by the device at a fast rate to collide with and stop the heart&#x2019;s reentry conduction impulses, and therefore to stop the tachycardia. Typically, ICDs also have pacemaker capability if the patient develops bradycardia, which sometimes occurs after treatment of the tachycardia. Usually, the mode is VVI.</p>
<p class="indent">The subcutaneous ICD is a more recently introduced therapeutic alternative to the conventional ICD. The main advantage to subcutaneous defibrillators is that the complications associated with vascular access are avoided. Patients without pacing indications, or antitachycardia pacing, or cardiac resynchronization are best candidates for this technology (<a href="#bib1731">Sideris, Archontakis, Gatzoulis, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Which device is used and how it is programmed depend on the patient&#x2019;s arrhythmia(s). The device may be programmed differently for different arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, VT with a fast ventricular rate, and VT with a slow ventricular rate). As with pacemakers, there is an NASPE-BPEG code for communicating the functions of the ICDs (<a href="#bib1697">Bernstein et&#x00A0;al., 2002</a>; <a href="#bib1735">Wilkoff et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). The first letter represents the chamber or chambers shocked (O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, both atrium and ventricle). The second letter represents the chamber that can be antitachycardia paced (O, A, V, D, meaning the same as the first letter). The third letter indicates the method used by the generator to detect a tachycardia (E, electrogram; H, hemodynamics). The last letter represents the chambers that have antibradycardia pacing (O, A, V, D, meaning the same as the first and second letters of the ICD code).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications of ICD implantation are similar to those associated with pacemaker insertion. The primary potential complication is surgery-related infection; its risk increases with battery or lead replacement. A few complications are associated with the technical aspects of the equipment, like those of pacemakers, such as premature battery depletion and dislodged or fractured leads. Inappropriate delivery of ICD therapy, usually due to oversensing or atrial and sinus tachycardias with a rapid ventricular rate response, is the most frequent long-term complication. This requires reprogramming of the device.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s831">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After a permanent electronic device (pacemaker or ICD) is inserted, the patient&#x2019;s heart rate and rhythm are monitored by ECG. The device&#x2019;s settings are noted and compared with the ECG recordings to assess the device&#x2019;s function. For example, pacemaker malfunction is detected by examining the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page721" title="721"></span>pacemaker spike and its relationship to the surrounding ECG complexes. In addition, cardiac output and hemodynamic stability are assessed to identify the patient&#x2019;s response to pacing and the adequacy of pacing. The appearance or increasing frequency of arrhythmia is observed and reported to the primary provider. If the patient has an ICD implanted and develops VT or ventricular fibrillation, the ECG should be recorded to note the time between the onset of the arrhythmia and the onset of the device&#x2019;s shock or antitachycardia pacing.</p>
<p class="indent">The incision site where the generator was implanted is observed for bleeding, hematoma formation, or infection, which may be evidenced by swelling, unusual tenderness, drainage, and increased warmth. The patient may complain of continuous throbbing or pain. These symptoms are reported to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="indent">A chest x-ray is usually taken after the procedure and prior to discharge to document the position of leads in addition to ensuring that the procedure did not cause a pneumothorax. It is necessary to assess the function of the device throughout its lifetime and especially after changes in the patient&#x2019;s medication regimen. For example, antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, and diuretics may increase the pacing threshold, whereas corticosteroids and alpha-adrenergic agents may decrease the pacing threshold; the opposite effect occurs when the patient is taken off these medications.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is also assessed for anxiety, depression, or anger, which may be symptoms of ineffective coping with the implantation. In addition, the level of knowledge and education needs of the patient and family and the history of adherence to the therapeutic regimen should be identified. It is especially important to include the family when providing education and support.</p>
<p class="indent">In the peri- and postoperative phases, the nurse carefully observes the patient&#x2019;s responses to the device and provides the patient and family with further education as needed. The nurse also assists the patient and family in addressing concerns and in making decisions about self-care and lifestyle changes necessitated by the arrhythmia and resulting device implantation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse changes the dressing as needed and inspects the insertion site for redness, swelling, soreness, or any unusual drainage. Any change in wound appearance, an increase in the patient&#x2019;s temperature, or an increase in the patient&#x2019;s white blood count should be reported to the primary provider.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Effective Coping</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient treated with an electronic device experiences not only lifestyle and physical changes but also emotional changes (Palese, Cracina, Purino, et&#x00A0;al., 2019; see <a href="#ct22-8">Chart&#x00A0;22-8</a> Nursing Research Profile: Experiences of Patients Shocked by an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator). At different times during the healing process, the patient may feel angry, depressed, fearful, anxious, or a combination of these emotions. Although each patient uses individual coping strategies (e.g., humor, prayer, communication with a significant other) to manage emotional distress, some strategies may work better than others. Signs that may indicate ineffective coping include social isolation, increased or prolonged irritability or depression, and difficulty in relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">To promote effective coping strategies, the nurse must recognize both the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s perceptions of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page722" title="722"></span>situation and their resulting emotional state and assist them to explore their reactions and feelings. Because of the unpredictable and possibly painful ICD discharge, patients with ICDs are most vulnerable to feelings of helplessness, leading to depression. The nurse can help the patient identify positive methods to deal with the actual or perceived limitations and manage any lifestyle changes needed. The nurse may help the patient identify changes (e.g., loss of ability to participate in contact sports), the emotional responses to the change (e.g., anger), and how the patient responds to that emotion (e.g., quickly becomes angry when talking with spouse). The nurse reassures the patient that these responses are normal and helps the patient identify realistic goals (e.g., develop interest in another activity) and develop a plan to attain these goals. The patient and family should be encouraged to talk about their experiences and emotions with each other and the health care team. The nurse may refer the patient and family to a hospital, community, or online support group. The nurse may also encourage the use of spiritual resources. Based on the patient&#x2019;s interest, the nurse also may educate the patient about easy-to-use stress reduction techniques (e.g., deep-breathing exercises, relaxation) to facilitate coping. Instructing the patient about the ICD may help the patient cope with changes that occur as a result of device implantation.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Experiences of Patients Shocked by an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Palese, A., Cracina, A., Purino, M., et&#x00A0;al. (2019). The experiences of patients electrically shocked by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator: Findings from a descriptive qualitative study. <em>Nursing in Critical Care</em>. Retrieved on 7/9/2019 at: doi.<a href="http://org/10.1111/nicc.12424">org/10.1111/nicc.12424</a></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Insertion rates for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have steadily risen. ICDs may be surgically implanted as a secondary preventive measure for survivors of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death and as primary prevention for patients with preexisting select cardiac conditions. The ICD is proven to be effective in lowering mortality rates in sudden cardiac death; however, little has been explored regarding the patients&#x2019; experiences as lived before, during, and after shocks from an ICD.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study used a descriptive qualitative design. A convenience sample of adult patients with ICDs who reported at least one shock during their first follow-up visit post ICD implantation were eligible to participate. All patients were followed by a cardiology department in an academic hospital located in northern Italy. A total of 50 participants consented to enroll in this study. Each participant went through semi-structured face-to-face audiorecorded interviews. Content analysis methodology was used to analyze the data.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The content analysis revealed four themes<em>: feeling surprised versus feeling altered by the changes inside me; living an intense, monodimensional experience versus living a multidimensional storm experience</em>; <em>facing the event alone versus being supported</em>; and <em>living a drama versus being used to it</em>. Most participants reported that they received shocks in their homes or in other community-based settings, many with family members present, and that they then presented to their local emergency department. Most participants could not recall the moments preceding the shocks, but did report feeling vague physical symptoms.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that ICD shocks can have a profound effect on patients&#x2019; physical and emotional health. Nurses need to be vigilant to recognize patients&#x2019; educational needs. Furthermore, nurses need to tailor appropriate, supportive interventions to improve patients&#x2019; experiences living with an ICD. In particular, nurses can assist patients with ICDs in identifying pre-shock prodromal physical symptoms so that the ICD may be reprogrammed if indicated, or so that the doses of antiarrhythmic medications might be better titrated to prevent arrhythmias. Moreover, most participants in this study received shocks outside the health care setting, and many of them were shocked in the presence of family members. Tailoring education programs to include significant others in identifying prodromal symptoms pre-shock and in seeking appropriate treatment post-shock may improve the quality of life of family members and patients with ICDs.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After device insertion, the patient&#x2019;s hospital stay is typically short (e.g., may be 1 day or less), and follow-up in an outpatient clinic, office, or device clinic is common. The patient&#x2019;s anxiety and feelings of vulnerability may interfere with the ability to learn information provided. The nurse needs to include caregivers in the education and provide printed materials for use by the patient and caregiver. The nurse establishes priorities for learning with the patient and caregiver. Education includes the importance of periodic device monitoring, promoting safety, surgical site care, and avoiding EMI (see <a href="#ct22-9">Chart&#x00A0;22-9</a>). In addition, the educational plan should include <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page723" title="723"></span>information about activities that are safe and those that may be dangerous. The nurse discusses with the patient and family what they have to do when a shock is delivered. The nurse may facilitate CPR training for the family.</p>

<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State the name, dose, side effects, frequency, and schedule for all medications.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>For patients with pacemakers, check pulse daily. Report <em>immediately</em> any sudden slowing or increasing of the pulse rate. This may indicate pacemaker malfunction.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid infection at the insertion site of the device:</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Leave the incision uncovered and observe it daily for redness, increased swelling, and heat.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take temperature at same time each day; report any increase.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing that may cause friction over the insertion site.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Initially avoid soaking in the tub and lotion, creams, or powders in the area of the device.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Adhere to activity restrictions:</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Restrict movement of arm until incision heals; do not raise arm above head for 2 wks.</p>

<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid large magnetic fields, such as those created by MRI, large motors, arc welding, and electrical substations. Magnetic fields may deactivate the device, negating its effect on an arrhythmia.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle_c22"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>At security gates at airports, government buildings, or other secured areas, show identification card and request a hand (not handheld device) search. Obtain and carry a letter from the primary provider about this requirement.</p>
