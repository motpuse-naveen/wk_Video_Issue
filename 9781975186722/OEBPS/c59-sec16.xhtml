<h4 class="h4" id="s2889">Motion Sickness</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Motion sickness is a disturbance of equilibrium caused by a conflict in motion receptor stimuli. For example, it can occur aboard a ship, in a car, while riding on a merry-go-round or swing, or even while viewing virtual motion on a large screen (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Brainard &#x0026; Gresham, 2014</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2890">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The syndrome manifests itself in sweating, pallor, nausea, and vomiting caused by vestibular overstimulation. These manifestations may persist for several hours after the stimulation stops.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2891">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Over-the-counter antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate or meclizine may provide some relief of nausea and vomiting by blocking the conduction of the vestibular pathway of the inner ear. Anticholinergic medications, such as scopolamine patches, may also be effective because they antagonize the histamine response. These must be applied 4 hours before exposure to motion and replaced every 3 days (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Brainard &#x0026; Gresham, 2014</a>). Side effects such as dry mouth and drowsiness may occur. Potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery should be avoided if drowsiness occurs.</p>
