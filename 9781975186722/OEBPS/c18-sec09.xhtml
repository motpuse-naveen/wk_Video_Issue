<h4 class="h4" id="s590">OBSTRUCTION AND TRAUMA OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY AIRWAY</h4>
<h4 class="h4" id="s591">Obstructive Sleep Apnea</h4>
<p class="nonindent">OSA is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction and a reduction in ventilation. It is defined as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apnea:&lt;/b&gt; temporary cessation of breathing">apnea</button></strong> (cessation of breathing) during sleep usually caused by repetitive upper airway obstruction. The estimated prevalence of OSA is approximately 26% of adults between the ages of 30 and 70 years (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>). It is believed that between 4% and 9% of women and 9% and 24% of men in the United States have OSA, and that up to 90% are not diagnosed; these increased rates have been linked to the increase in rates of obesity (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>) (see <a href="c42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>). OSA interferes with people&#x2019;s ability to obtain adequate rest, thus affecting memory, learning, and decision making.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk factors for OSA include obesity, male gender, postmenopausal status in women, and advanced age. The major risk factor is obesity; a larger neck circumference and increased amounts of peripharyngeal fat narrow and compress the upper airway. Because OSA is often found in patients with hypertension, all adult patients with hypertension should be screened for OSA (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1421">Showalter &#x0026; O&#x2019;Keefe, 2019</a>). Other associated factors include alterations in the upper airway, such as structural changes (e.g., tonsillar hypertrophy, abnormal posterior positioning of one or both jaws, and variations in craniofacial structures) that contribute to the collapsibility of the upper airway (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s592">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pharynx is a collapsible tube that can be compressed by the soft tissues and structures surrounding it. The tone of the muscles of the upper airway is reduced during sleep. Mechanical factors such as reduced diameter of the upper airway or dynamic changes in the upper airway during sleep may result in obstruction. These sleep-related changes may predispose to upper airway collapse when small amounts of negative pressure are generated during inspiration.</p>
<p class="indent">Repetitive apneic events result in hypoxia (decreased oxygen saturation) and hypercapnia (increased concentration of carbon dioxide), which triggers a sympathetic response. As a consequence, patients with OSA have a high prevalence of hypertension. In addition, OSA is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, which may be mitigated with appropriate treatment (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s593">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">OSA is characterized by frequent and loud snoring with breathing cessation for 10 seconds or longer, for at least five episodes per hour, followed by awakening abruptly with a loud snort as the blood oxygen level drops. Patients with sleep apnea may have anywhere from five apneic episodes per hour to several hundred per night.</p>
<p class="indent">Classic signs and symptoms of OSA include the &#x201C;3 S&#x2019;s&#x201D;&#x2014;namely, <em>s</em>noring, <em>s</em>leepiness, and <em>s</em>ignificant-other report of sleep apnea episodes. Common signs and symptoms of OSA are presented in <a href="#ct18-4">Chart&#x00A0;18-4</a>. Symptoms typically progress with increases in weight and aging (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>). Patients are typically unaware of nocturnal upper airway obstruction during sleep. They frequently complain of insomnia, including difficulty in going to sleep, nighttime awakenings, and early morning awakenings with an inability to go back to sleep, as well as chronic fatigue and hypersomnolence (daytime sleepiness). When obtaining the health history, the nurse asks the patient about sleeping during normal activities such as eating or talking. Patients with this symptom are considered to have pathologic hypersomnolence (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s594">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of sleep apnea is based on clinical features plus a polysomnographic finding (i.e., sleep study), which is the definitive test for OSA. The test is an overnight study, performed in a specialized sleep disorders center, which continuously measures multiple physiologic signals while the patient sleeps. These signals are analyzed as they are related to stages of sleep; measures include those taken by electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram, and chin electromyogram (EMG). In addition, cardiac rhythms and arrhythmias are monitored with a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and leg movements are recorded by an anterior tibialis EMG. Airflow at the nose and mouth is monitored using both a thermal sensor and a nasal pressure transducer, breathing effort is monitored using inductance plethysmography, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation is monitored by oximetry. The breathing pattern is analyzed for the presence of apneas and hypopneas. Characteristic findings consistent with OSA include apneic episodes occurring in the presence of respiratory muscle effort, clinically significant apneic episodes lasting 10 seconds or longer, and apneic episodes most prevalent during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. Sleep disruption from automated patient arousal is usually seen at the termination of an episode of apnea (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s595">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients usually seek medical treatment because their sleeping partners express concern or because they experience excessive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page511" title="511"></span>sleepiness at inappropriate times or settings (e.g., while driving a car). A variety of treatments are used. Weight loss, avoidance of alcohol, positional therapy (using devices that prevent patients from sleeping on their backs), and oral appliances such as mandibular advancement devices (MADs) are the first steps (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1382">American Sleep Apnea Association, 2019</a>; <a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Joshi, 2018</a>). When applied correctly, an MAD advances the mandible so that it is slightly anterior to the upper front teeth, preventing airway obstruction by the tongue and soft tissue during sleep. A randomized controlled trial that compared the effectiveness of these devices among patients with OSA with the more conventional therapy, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), found no difference in short-term outcomes between MAD and CPAP, including daytime sleepiness and quality of life, suggesting that MAD is as effective a treatment as CPAP in patients with mild-to-moderate OSA (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1416">Petri, Christensen, Svanholt, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Viscuso &#x0026; Arena, 2016</a>). In more severe cases involving hypoxemia and severe hypercapnia, the treatment includes CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. CPAP is used to prevent airway collapse, whereas BiPAP makes breathing easier and results in a lower average airway pressure (Patil, Ayappa, Caples, et&#x00A0;al., 2019; the use of CPAP and BiPAP is discussed in more detail in <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical procedures also may be performed to correct OSA. Simple tonsillectomy may be effective for patients with larger tonsils when deemed clinically necessary, or when other options have failed or are refused by patients (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Morgan, 2017</a>). Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty is the resection of pharyngeal soft tissue and removal of approximately 15 mm of the free edge of the soft palate and uvula. Effective in about 50% of patients, it is more effective in eliminating snoring than apnea. Nasal septoplasty may be performed for gross anatomic nasal septal deformities. Maxillomandibular surgery may be performed to advance the maxilla and mandible forward in order to enlarge the posterior pharyngeal region (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Morgan, 2017</a>). Tracheostomy relieves upper airway obstruction but has numerous adverse effects, including speech difficulties and increased risk of infections. These procedures, as well as other maxillofacial surgeries, are reserved for patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease and life-threatening arrhythmias or severe disability who have not responded to conventional therapy (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Some medications are useful in managing symptoms associated with OSA. Modafinil is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients who have residual daytime sleepiness despite optimal use of CPAP. The most improvement has been seen in patients who have taken modafinil at daily doses of 200 to 400 mg. Armodafinil is also now approved by the FDA for use in these patients. It is more potent than modafinil because it is pure R-modafinil, which is the most psychoactive compound of modafinil (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Wickramasinghe, 2019</a>). Protriptyline given at bedtime may increase the respiratory drive and improve upper airway muscle tone. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and acetazolamide might be prescribed for sleep apnea associated with chronic alveolar hypoventilation; however, their benefits have not been well established. The patient must understand that these medications are not a substitute for CPAP, BiPAP, or MAD. Administration of low-flow nasal oxygen at night can help relieve hypoxemia in some patients but has little effect on the frequency or severity of apnea.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s596">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with OSA may not recognize the potential consequences of the disorder. Therefore, the nurse explains the disorder in terms that are understandable to the patient and relates symptoms (daytime sleepiness) to the underlying disorder. The nurse also instructs the patient and family about treatments, including the correct and safe use of CPAP, BiPAP, MAD, and oxygen therapy, if prescribed. The nurse educates the patient about the risk of untreated OSA and the benefits of treatment approaches.</p>
