<h4 class="h4" id="s3030">Herpes Simplex Encephalitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Encephalitis is an acute inflammatory process of the brain tissue. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of acute encephalitis in the United States, accounting for 10% to 15% of cases of encephalitis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3031">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathology of encephalitis involves local necrotizing hemorrhage that becomes more generalized, followed by edema. There is also progressive deterioration of nerve cell bodies (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3032">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The initial symptoms of herpes simplex encephalitis include fever, headache, confusion, and hallucinations. Focal neurologic symptoms reflect the areas of cerebral inflammation and necrosis and include fever, headache, behavioral changes, focal seizures, dysphasia, hemiparesis, and altered LOC (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3033">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neuroimaging studies, such as electroencephalography (EEG), and CSF examination are used to diagnose encephalitis. MRI is used to detect inflammation that shows up as hyperintense (bright) areas (see <a href="#ff64-2">Fig.&#x00A0;64-2</a>). The EEG shows diffuse slowing or focal changes in the temporal lobe in the majority of patients. Lumbar puncture often reveals a high opening pressure, glucose within normal limits, and high protein levels in CSF samples (see <a href="c64-sec02.xhtml#tt64-1">Table&#x00A0;64-1</a>). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the standard test for early diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis. PCR identifies the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bands of HSV-1 in the CSF with 95% sensitivity and 99% specificity rates (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3034">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The antiviral agent acyclovir is the medication of choice in the treatment for HSV (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Early administration of an antiviral agent (usually well tolerated) improves the prognosis associated with HSV. The mode of action is inhibition of viral DNA replication. To prevent relapse, treatment should continue for up to 3 weeks. Slow IV administration over 1 hour prevents crystallization of the medication in the urine. The usual dose of acyclovir is decreased if the patient has a history of renal insufficiency.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3035">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of neurologic function is key to monitoring the progression of disease. Comfort measures to reduce headache include dimming the lights, limiting noise and visitors, grouping nursing interventions, and administering analgesic agents. Opioid analgesic medications may mask neurologic symptoms; therefore, they are used cautiously. Seizures and altered LOC require care directed at injury prevention and safety. Nursing care addressing patient and family anxieties is ongoing throughout the illness. Monitoring of blood chemistry test results and urinary output alert the nurse to the presence of renal complications related to antiviral therapy.</p>
