<h4 class="h4" id="s1054">Hypertensive Crises</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Two classes of hypertensive crisis that require immediate intervention include hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency, which occur when the SBP exceeds 180 mm Hg or the DBP exceeds 120 mm Hg. Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies may occur in patients with secondary hypertension, and in those whose hypertension has been poorly controlled, whose hypertension has been undiagnosed, or in those who have abruptly discontinued their medications (i.e., rebound hypertension). Once the hypertensive crisis <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page880" title="880"></span>has been managed, a complete evaluation is performed to review the patient&#x2019;s ongoing treatment plan, and strategies to prevent the occurrence of subsequent hypertensive crises are implemented (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1055"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Hypertensive Emergency</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypertensive emergency:&lt;/b&gt; an emergent situation in which blood pressure is severely elevated and there is evidence of actual or probable target organ damage">Hypertensive emergency</button></strong> is severe BP elevation (SBP greater than 180 mm Hg or DBP greater than 120 mm Hg) with new or worsening target organ damage. Some examples of target organ damage that may occur include hypertensive encephalopathy, ischemic stroke, MI, heart failure with pulmonary edema, dissecting aortic aneurysm, and renal failure. The 1-year mortality rate is more than 79% and median survival is 10.4 months if left untreated (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The patient needs to be admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring of BP and parenteral administration of an appropriate antihypertensive medication (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A rapid and focused assessment is necessary to determine possible causes and target organ involvement. For patients with suspected aortic dissection, the management goal is to reduce the SBP to less than 120 mm Hg within the first hour of treatment (<a href="#bib2024">Fukui, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). For those patients with suspected severe preeclampsia/eclampsia or pheochromocytoma crises, the management goal is to reduce the SBP to less than 140 mm Hg within the first hour of treatment (<a href="#bib2024">Lim, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The treatment management goal for other patients with hypertensive emergencies is to reduce the SBP by no more than 25% within the first hour of treatment, and then, if the patient is stable, to 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours with an eventual goal of a normal, controlled blood pressure within 24 to 48 hours of when treatment commenced (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The antihypertensive medications of choice are those that have immediate onsets of action, and can include intravenous drugs such as nicardipine, clevidipine, labetalol, esmolol, nitroglycerin, and nitroprusside (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). To date, there is a dearth of research findings that demonstrate the superiority of any antihypertensive medications in treating hypertensive emergencies (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1056"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Hypertensive Urgency</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypertensive urgency:&lt;/b&gt; an urgent situation in which blood pressure is severely elevated but there is no evidence of impending or progressive target organ damage">Hypertensive urgency</button></strong> is severe BP elevation (SBP greater than 180 mm Hg or DBP greater than 120 mm Hg) in stable patients without target organ damage as evidenced based on clinical examination and results of laboratory studies. Many times, patients with a hypertensive urgency are nonadherent with antihypertensive therapy, resulting in rebound hypertension. The underlying reason for nonadherence should be explored (e.g., finances, anxiety, misunderstandings, miscommunication, drug side effects, or recreational drug use) and the team approach used and resources mobilized to prevent nonadherence from continuing or recurring. Restarting antihypertensive medication therapy or increasing dosages are indicated in treating these patients (<a href="#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Extremely close monitoring of the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure and cardiovascular status is required during treatment of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> for discussion of cardiovascular assessment). The exact frequency of monitoring is a matter of clinical judgment and varies with the patient&#x2019;s condition. Taking vital signs every 5 minutes is appropriate if the blood pressure is changing rapidly; taking vital signs at 15- or 30-minute intervals in a more stable situation may be sufficient. A precipitous drop in blood pressure can occur that would require immediate action to restore blood pressure to an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/xxvii-3.jpg" alt=""/> You are working as a nurse in a clinic that serves both an assisted living and a skilled nursing facility. One of your patients is an 80-year-old woman who is a new resident at the assisted living facility. When you take her blood pressure, you note that it is 110/70 mm Hg. While talking with her, you find that she reports episodes of dizziness and has fallen twice in the past 2 weeks. She tells you that she takes her medications as prescribed and has had no other concerns. What additional assessment data do you need to obtain? What is your priority plan of action?</p>
<p class="reviewline">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/xxvii-1.jpg" alt=""/> You are employed as an occupational health nurse in a manufacturing facility. A 32-year-old man who operates a forklift presents to be treated after injuring his forearm at work. During your assessment, he reports that he takes a beta-blocker for his hypertension and his blood pressure is 108/77 mm Hg. He also tells you that he is dedicated to staying healthy, has no underlying cardiac disease, and routinely exercises at the gym. He has noted that he cannot get his heart rate up no matter how long he works out and feels tired all the time. What further follow-up would you recommend and with whom?</p>
<p class="reviewline">&#x00A0;</p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/xxvii-2.jpg" alt=""/> You are working in a clinic and a 50-year-old man presents for his annual examination. He takes no medications at present but reports that last year he was told that his blood pressure was elevated and that he needed to start taking an antihypertensive medication. He never filled that prescription because he had no symptoms and thought that if he had high blood pressure, he would feel bad. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg and the rest of his examination is unremarkable. What education would you provide for him? What is the strength of the evidence that supports your education plan and follow-up with this patient?</p>
