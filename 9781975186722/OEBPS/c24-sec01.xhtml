<h4 class="h4" id="s861">VALVULAR DISORDERS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Valves of the heart control blood flow through the heart into the pulmonary artery and aorta by opening and closing in response to blood pressure changes during the cardiac cycle (systole, or heart contraction, and diastole, or relaxation of the heart).</p>
<p class="indent">Atrioventricular valves separate the atria from the ventricles and include the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tricuspid valve:&lt;/b&gt; atrioventricular valve located between the right atrium and right ventricle">tricuspid valve</button></strong>, which separates the right atrium from the right ventricle, and the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mitral valve:&lt;/b&gt; atrioventricular valve located between the left atrium and left ventricle">mitral valve</button></strong>, which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three leaflets; the mitral valve has two. Both valves have <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chordae tendineae:&lt;/b&gt; nondistensible fibrous strands connecting papillary muscles to atrioventricular (mitral, tricuspid) valve leaflets">chordae tendineae</button></strong>, which are nondistensible fibrous strands that anchor valve leaflets to papillary muscles of the ventricles.</p>
<p class="indent">Semilunar valves are located between the ventricles and their corresponding arteries. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pulmonic valve:&lt;/b&gt; semilunar valve located between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery">pulmonic valve</button></strong> lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery; the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aortic valve:&lt;/b&gt; semilunar valve located between the left ventricle and aorta">aortic valve</button></strong> lies between the left ventricle and the aorta. <a href="#ff24-1">Figure 24-1</a> shows valves in the closed position (also refer to Chapter 21, <a href="c21-sec01.xhtml#ff21-1">Fig. 21-1</a> to review the structure of a normal heart).</p>
<p class="indent">When any heart valve does not close or open properly, blood flow is affected. When valves do not close completely, blood flows backward through the valve, a condition called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;regurgitation:&lt;/b&gt; backward flow of blood through a heart valve (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; insufficiency)">regurgitation</button></strong> (also referred to as insufficiency). When valves do not open completely, a condition called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stenosis:&lt;/b&gt; narrowing or obstruction of a cardiac valve&#x2019;s orifice">stenosis</button></strong>, blood flow through the valve is reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">Regurgitation and stenosis may affect any heart valve. The mitral valve may also <strong>prolapse</strong> (i.e., stretching of the valve leaflet into the atrium during systole). For patients without symptoms, heart valve conditions may be monitored without treatment. If a patient has symptoms related to a valve disorder, treatment is based on the severity of symptoms, and patients may need to make lifestyle changes, take medications, or undergo repair or replacement of the valve. Disorders of the mitral and aortic valve typically cause more symptoms, require treatment, and cause more complications than disorders of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Regurgitation and stenosis may occur at the same time in the same or different valves (<a href="#ff24-2">Fig. 24-2</a>).</p>
