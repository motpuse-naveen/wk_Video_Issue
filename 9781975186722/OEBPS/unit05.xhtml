<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps_un5">A</span> n 85-year-old male presents to the emergency department with complaints of substernal chest pressure rated 9 on a 0&#x2013;10 pain scale with pain radiating to his left arm. Other signs and symptoms include nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath (SOB), diaphoresis, and a feeling of &#x201C;something bad is happening to me.&#x201D; He is emergently sent for cardiac catheterization; a 90% distal and 85% proximal stenosis of the right coronary artery was detected. He subsequently underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention with balloon angioplasty and placement of stents. Once recovered from anesthesia he is admitted to the cardiac step-down unit where you work. When receiving report you notice in the electronic health record (EHR) that the patient should have received the first dose of two medications in the cardiac catheterization lab following the procedure. However, these medications were not administered as prescribed and you notify the interventional cardiologist about this error.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <em>patient-centered care</em>, <em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em>, <em>evidence-based practice</em>, <em>quality improvement</em>, <em>safety</em>, and <em>informatics.</em></p>
