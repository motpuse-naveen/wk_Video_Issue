<h4 class="h4" id="s1733">Intestinal Obstruction</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Intestinal obstruction exists when blockage prevents the normal flow of intestinal contents through the intestinal tract. Two types of processes can impede this flow (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ramnarine, 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Mechanical obstruction: Extrinsic</em> lesions from outside the intestines or <em>intrinsic</em> lesions within the intestines can obstruct flow. Examples of extrinsic lesions include adhesions, hernias, and abscesses. Examples of intrinsic lesions include intestinal tumors (benign and cancerous), strictures (from prior surgery or radiation), or <em>intraluminal</em> lesions due to a defect in the bowel lumen (e.g., intussusception).</span></li>
<li><span><em>Functional or paralytic obstruction:</em> The intestinal musculature cannot propel the contents along the bowel either due to interruption of innervation or vascular supply to the bowel. Examples are amyloidosis, muscular dystrophy, endocrine disorders such as diabetes, or neurologic disorders such as Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. The blockage also can be temporary and the result of the manipulation of the bowel during surgery (i.e., ileus).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Obstruction can occur in the large or small intestine and can be partial or complete. Severity depends on the region of bowel affected, the degree to which the lumen is occluded, and especially the degree to which the vascular supply to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1303" title="1303"></span>the bowel wall is disturbed. Most obstructions occur in the small intestine. Adhesions, hernia, and tumor account for 90% of obstructions in the small intestines (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bordeianou &#x0026; Yeh, 2019</a>). Other causes of small bowel obstruction include Crohn&#x2019;s disease, intussusception, volvulus, and paralytic ileus. Most obstructions in the large intestines occur in the sigmoid colon. The most common causes of large bowel obstruction are cancer (60%), diverticular disease (20%), and volvulus (5%). Other causes of large bowel obstruction include benign tumors, strictures, and obstipation or fecal impaction (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hopkins, 2017</a>). <a href="#tt41-4">Table 41-4</a> and <a href="#ff41-5">Figure 41-5</a> list mechanical causes of obstruction and describe how they occur.</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s1734"><strong>Small Bowel Obstruction</strong></h3>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1734a"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">Intestinal contents, fluid, and gas accumulate proximal to the intestinal obstruction. The abdominal distention and retention of fluid reduce the absorption of fluids and stimulate more gastric secretion. With increasing distention, pressure within the intestinal lumen increases, causing a decrease in venous and arteriolar capillary pressure. Third-spacing of fluids, electrolytes, and proteins into the intestinal lumen occurs, resulting in decreased circulating fluid volume and dehydration. With continued intestinal distention and edema, perfusion to the affected intestinal segment can be compromised, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and eventual rupture or perforation of the intestinal wall, with resultant peritonitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bordeianou &#x0026; Yeh, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ramnarine, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1735">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The initial symptom is usually crampy pain that is wavelike and colicky due to persistent peristalsis both above and below the blockage. The patient may pass blood and mucus but no fecal matter and no flatus. Vomiting occurs. If the obstruction is complete, the peristaltic waves initially become extremely vigorous and eventually assume a reverse direction, with the intestinal contents propelled toward the mouth instead of toward the rectum. The signs of dehydration become evident: intense thirst, drowsiness, oliguria, generalized malaise, aching, and a parched tongue and mucous membranes. The patient may continue to have flatus and stool early in the process due to distal peristalsis. The abdomen becomes distended. The lower the obstruction in the GI tract, the more marked the abdominal distention; this may cause reflux vomiting. Vomiting results in loss of hydrogen ions and potassium from the stomach, leading to reduction of chloride and potassium in the blood and to metabolic alkalosis. Dehydration and acidosis develop from loss of water and sodium. With acute fluid losses, hypovolemic shock may occur; septic shock may also occur (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bordeianou &#x0026; Yeh, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ramnarine, 2017</a>) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1303</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1304" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1304">p. 1304</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1736">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, physical assessment findings, and the results of imaging studies. Early in the process, bowel sounds are high-pitched and hyperactive in an attempt to pass the obstruction; later, bowel sounds will be hypoactive. Changes in the pattern (constant) or increased intensity of bowel sounds may also be indicative of strangulation or ischemic bowel (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bordeianou &#x0026; Yeh, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ramnarine, 2017</a>). Abdominal x-ray and CT scan findings include abnormal quantities of gas, fluid, or both in the intestines and sometimes collapsed distal bowel. Laboratory studies (i.e., electrolyte studies and a CBC) reveal a picture of dehydration, loss of plasma volume, and possible infection. The approach to small bowel obstruction focuses on confirming the diagnosis, identifying the etiology, and determining the likelihood of strangulation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1737">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Decompression of the bowel through insertion of an NG tube is necessary for all patients with small bowel obstruction; this may be tried for up to 3 days for patients with partial obstructions, as resting the bowel in this manner can result in resolution of the obstruction (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ramnarine, 2017</a>). For patients with adhesions, administration of hypertonic water-soluble GI contrast media (Gastrografin) may be of benefit in stimulating peristalsis and determining the probability of needing surgical intervention. The dye is administered via NG tube, the tube is clamped for 2 to 4 hours, then an abdominal x-ray is taken within 6 to 24 hours; evidence of the dye in the large intestine is predictive of resolution of obstruction without surgical intervention (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bordeianou &#x0026; Yeh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 25% of patients with obstruction will need surgical intervention (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bordeianou &#x0026; Yeh, 2019</a>). When the bowel is completely obstructed, the possibility of strangulation and tissue necrosis warrants surgical intervention. Before surgery, IV fluids are necessary to replace the depleted water, sodium, chloride, and potassium.</p>
<p class="indent">The surgical treatment of intestinal obstruction depends on the cause of the obstruction. For the most common causes of obstruction, such as hernia and adhesions, the surgical procedure involves repairing the hernia or dividing the adhesion to which the intestine is attached. In some instances, the portion of affected bowel may be removed and an anastomosis performed. The complexity of the surgical procedure depends on the duration of the intestinal obstruction and the condition of the intestine. Open or laparoscopic technique can be used.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1738">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of the patient with a small bowel obstruction who does not require surgery includes maintaining the function of the NG tube, assessing and measuring the NG output, assessing for fluid and electrolyte imbalance, monitoring nutritional status, and assessing for manifestations consistent with resolution (e.g., return of normal bowel sounds, decreased abdominal distention, subjective improvement in abdominal pain and tenderness, passage of flatus or stool).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance is a priority to monitor in the patient with a small bowel obstruction. The presence of the NG tube in conjunction with the patient&#x2019;s nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status places the patient at significant risk of fluid imbalance. Thus, measures to promote fluid balance are critically important.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The nurse reports discrepancies in the patient&#x2019;s intake and output, worsening of pain or abdominal distention, and increased NG output. If the patient&#x2019;s condition does not improve, the nurse prepares them for surgery. This preparation includes preoperative education as the patient&#x2019;s condition indicates. Nursing care of the patient after surgical repair of a small bowel obstruction is similar to that for other abdominal surgeries (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>).</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s1739"><strong>Large Bowel Obstruction</strong></h3>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1739a">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A large bowel obstruction results in an accumulation of intestinal contents, fluid, and gas proximal to the obstruction. It can lead to severe distention and perforation unless some gas and fluid can flow back through the ileocecal valve. Large bowel obstruction, even if complete, may be undramatic if the blood supply to the colon is not disturbed. However, if the blood supply is cut off, intestinal strangulation and necrosis occur; this condition is life threatening. In the large intestine, dehydration occurs more slowly than in the small intestine because the colon can absorb its fluid contents and can distend to a size considerably beyond its normal full capacity. Similar to small bowel obstruction, complications include perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1740">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Large bowel obstruction differs clinically from small bowel obstruction in that the symptoms develop and progress relatively slowly. In patients with obstruction in the sigmoid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1305" title="1305"></span>colon or the rectum, constipation may be the only symptom for weeks. The shape of the stool is altered as it passes the obstruction that is gradually increasing in size. Blood loss in the stool may result in iron deficiency anemia. The patient may experience weakness, weight loss, and anorexia. Eventually, the abdomen becomes markedly distended, loops of large bowel become visibly outlined through the abdominal wall, and the patient has crampy lower abdominal pain (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hopkins, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1741">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical assessment findings, and on imaging studies. The abdomen may be distended, bowel sounds may be normal early in the obstruction, but later hypoactive to absent, and the abdomen hyperresonant (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hopkins, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Abdominal x-ray and abdominal CT or MRI findings reveal a distended colon and pinpoint the site of the obstruction (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hopkins, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1742">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Restoration of intravascular volume, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and NG aspiration and decompression are instituted immediately. A colonoscopy may be performed to untwist and decompress the bowel. A rectal tube may be used to decompress an area that is lower in the bowel. As an alternative, a metal colonic stent may be used as either a palliative intervention or as a bridge to definitive surgery. The colonic stent is placed endoscopically with the assistance of an image intensifier, which creates a fluoroscopic image (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hopkins, 2017</a>). The usual treatment is surgical resection to remove the obstructing lesion. A temporary or permanent colostomy may be necessary. An ileoanal anastomosis may be performed if removal of the entire large bowel is necessary (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hopkins, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1743">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse&#x2019;s role is to monitor the patient for symptoms indicating that the intestinal obstruction is worsening or resolving and to provide emotional support and comfort. The nurse administers IV fluids and electrolytes as prescribed. If the patient&#x2019;s condition does not respond to nonsurgical treatment, the nurse prepares the patient for surgery. This preparation includes preoperative education as the patient&#x2019;s condition indicates. After surgery, routine postoperative nursing care is provided, including abdominal wound care (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>).</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec15"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):&lt;/b&gt; group of chronic disorders (ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x2019;s disease) that result in inflammation or ulceration (or both) of the bowel lining">INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE</button></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</strong> is a group of chronic disorders: Crohn&#x2019;s disease and ulcerative colitis that result in inflammation or ulceration (or both) of the bowel. Both disorders have striking similarities but also several differences. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with IBD have characteristics of both disorders and cannot be definitively diagnosed with either disorder and are classified as having indeterminate colitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). <a href="#tt41-5">Table 41-5</a> compares Crohn&#x2019;s disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>
<p class="indent">The prevalence of IBD in the United States has increased in the past century; it is estimated that 1.3% of adults are diagnosed with IBD (CDC, 2019). Prevalence is highest in Europe (particularly in Germany and Norway), the United States, and Canada, although the incidence has been increasing in South America, Africa, and Asia (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3094">Piovani, Danese, Peyrin-Biroulet, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Family history predisposes people to IBD, particularly if a first-degree relative has the disease (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Other risk factors for IBD include being Caucasian, of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, living in a northern climate, and living in an urban area (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Both diseases are commonly diagnosed in people 15 to 40 years of age, with a second peak incidence in adults 55 to 65 years of age (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Current smokers are at risk for Crohn&#x2019;s disease, but those who are ex-smokers or nonsmokers are at risk for ulcerative colitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Piovani et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Despite extensive research, the cause of IBD is still unknown. Three underlying factors are genetic predisposition, altered immune response, and an altered response to gut microorganisms (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Researchers theorize that environmental triggers (e.g., exposure to air pollutants), food, tobacco, and viral illnesses in people genetically predisposed to developing an IBD can trigger the cell-mediated immune response that results in the inflammatory changes that characterize IBDs (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Inflammatory cytokines have been identified in the pathologic and clinical characteristics of both disorders (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>). Both disorders have extra-intestinal manifestations; systemic symptoms common to both include fever, arthralgias, malaise, and episodes of diaphoresis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1744">Crohn&#x2019;s Disease (Regional Enteritis)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Crohn&#x2019;s disease, also called regional enteritis, is characterized by a subacute and chronic inflammation of the GI tract wall that extends through all layers (i.e., transmural lesion). Although its characteristic histopathologic changes can occur anywhere in the GI tract, it most commonly occurs in the distal ileum and the ascending colon. Approximately 35% of patients have ileitis (only ileal involvement); 45% have ileocolitis (diseased ileum and colon); and 20% have granulomatous colitis (only colon involvement) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1745">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The inflammatory process in Crohn&#x2019;s disease begins with crypt inflammation and abscesses, which develop into small, focal ulcers. These initial lesions then deepen into longitudinal and transverse ulcers, separated by edematous patches, creating a characteristic <em>cobblestone</em> appearance in the affected bowel. Fistulas, fissures, and abscesses form as the inflammation extends into the peritoneum. Granulomas can occur in lymph nodes, the peritoneum, and through the layers of the bowel in about half of patients. Diseased bowel segments are sharply demarcated by adjoining areas of normal bowel tissue. These are called <em>skip</em> lesions, from which the label <em>regional enteritis</em> is derived. As the disease advances, the bowel wall thickens and becomes fibrotic, and the intestinal lumen narrows. Diseased bowel loops sometimes adhere to other loops surrounding them (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1746">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The onset of symptoms is usually insidious in Crohn&#x2019;s disease, with diarrhea and prominent right lower quadrant abdominal pain unrelieved by defecation. Scar tissue and the formation of granulomas interfere with the ability of the intestine to transport products of upper intestinal digestion through the constricted lumen, resulting in crampy abdominal pain. There is abdominal tenderness and spasm. Because eating stimulates intestinal peristalsis, the crampy pains occur after meals. To avoid these bouts of crampy pain, the patient tends to limit food intake, reducing the amounts and types of food to such a degree that normal nutritional requirements are often not met. As a result, weight loss, malnutrition, and secondary anemia occur. Ulcers in the membranous lining of the intestine and other inflammatory changes result in a weeping, edematous intestine that continually empties an irritating discharge into the colon. Disrupted absorption causes chronic diarrhea and nutritional deficits, which can lead to significant weight loss and dehydration. In some patients, the inflamed intestine may perforate, leading to intra-abdominal and anal abscesses. Fever and leukocytosis occur. Chronic symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;steatorrhea:&lt;/b&gt; fatty stool; typically malodorous with an oily appearance and floats in water">steatorrhea</button></strong> (i.e., excessive fat in the feces), anorexia, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p class="indent">Manifestations may extend beyond the GI tract and can include joint disorders (e.g., arthritis), skin lesions (e.g., erythema nodosum), ocular disorders (e.g., uveitis), and oral ulcers. The clinical course and symptoms can vary; in some patients, periods of remission and exacerbation occur, but in others, the disease follows a fulminating course. When <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1307" title="1307"></span>intestinal symptoms worsen, some extraintestinal manifestations can worsen, whereas the clinical course of some extraintestinal manifestations seems independent of the clinical course of the Crohn&#x2019;s disease (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1747">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CT scan is indicated to find bowel wall thickening and mesenteric edema, as well as obstructions, abscesses, and fistulas, and may help specify abscess formation and location, guiding percutaneous access and drainage. MRI is both highly sensitive and specific in terms of identifying pelvic and perianal abscesses and fistulas (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A CBC is performed to assess hematocrit and hemoglobin levels (which may be decreased) as well as the WBC count (may be elevated). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually elevated. Albumin and protein levels may be decreased, indicating malnutrition (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1748">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of Crohn&#x2019;s disease include intestinal obstruction or stricture formation, perianal disease, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition from malabsorption, and fistula and abscess formation. The most common type of small bowel fistula caused by Crohn&#x2019;s disease is the enterocutaneous fistula (i.e., an abnormal opening between the small bowel and the skin). Abscesses can be the result of an internal fistula that results in fluid accumulation and infection. Patients with colonic Crohn&#x2019;s disease are also at increased risk of colon cancer (NIDDK, 2017d).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1749">Ulcerative Colitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ulcerative colitis is a chronic ulcerative and inflammatory disease of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the colon and rectum that is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and exacerbation with bouts of abdominal cramps and bloody or purulent diarrhea. The inflammatory changes typically begin in the rectum and progress proximally through the colon (Basson, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1750">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ulcerative colitis affects the superficial mucosa of the colon and is characterized by multiple ulcerations, diffuse inflammations, and desquamation or shedding of the colonic epithelium. Bleeding occurs as a result of the ulcerations. The mucosa becomes edematous and inflamed. The lesions are contiguous, occurring one after the other. Eventually, the bowel narrows, shortens, and thickens because of muscular hypertrophy and fat deposits. Because the inflammatory process is not transmural (i.e., it affects the inner lining only), abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, and fissures are uncommon in ulcerative colitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1751">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical course is usually one of remissions and exacerbations. The predominant symptoms of ulcerative colitis include diarrhea, with passage of mucus, pus, or blood; left lower quadrant abdominal pain; and intermittent tenesmus. The bleeding may be mild or severe, and pallor, anemia, and fatigue result. The patient may have anorexia, weight loss, fever, vomiting, and dehydration, as well as cramping, and the passage of six or more liquid stools each day. The disease is classified as mild, severe, or fulminant, depending on the severity of the symptoms. Hypoalbuminemia, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia frequently develop. Extraintestinal manifestations include skin lesions (e.g., erythema nodosum), eye lesions (e.g., uveitis), joint abnormalities (e.g., arthritis), and liver disease (Basson, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1752">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Abdominal x-ray studies are useful for determining the cause of symptoms. Free air in the peritoneum and bowel dilation or obstruction should be excluded as a source of the presenting symptoms. Colonoscopy is the definitive screening test that can distinguish ulcerative colitis from other diseases of the colon with similar symptoms. It may reveal friable, inflamed mucosa with exudate and ulcerations. Biopsies are typically taken to determine histologic characteristics of the colonic tissue and extent of disease. CT scanning, MRI, and ultrasound studies can identify abscesses and perirectal involvement (Basson, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">The stool is positive for blood, and laboratory test results reveal low hematocrit and hemoglobin levels in addition to an elevated WBC count, low albumin levels (indicating malabsorptive disorders), and an electrolyte imbalance. C-reactive protein levels are elevated. Elevated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels are common. Careful stool examination for parasites and other microbes is performed to rule out dysentery caused by common intestinal organisms, especially <em>Entamoeba histolytica, C. difficile</em> and <em>Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella,</em> and <em>Cryptospora</em> species (Basson, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1753">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of ulcerative colitis include toxic megacolon, perforation, and bleeding as a result of ulceration. In toxic megacolon, the inflammatory process extends into the muscularis, inhibiting its ability to contract and resulting in colonic distention. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain and distention, vomiting, and fatigue. If the patient with toxic megacolon does not respond within 72 hours to medical management with NG suction, IV fluids with electrolytes, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, surgery is required. A subtotal colectomy may be performed if bowel perforation has not occurred. Otherwise, colectomy is indicated; it is ultimately needed in up to one third of patients with severe ulcerative colitis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>). For many patients, surgery becomes necessary to relieve the effects of the disease and to treat these serious complications; an ileostomy usually is performed. The surgical procedures involved and the care of patients with this type of fecal diversion are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with ulcerative colitis also have a significantly increased risk of osteoporotic fractures due to decreased bone mineral density. Corticosteroid therapy may also contribute to the diminished bone density. Patients with ulcerative colitis are also at increased risk for colon cancer. Approximately 20 years post diagnosis, an estimated 7% to 10% of patients with extensive ulcerative colitis (i.e., not contained to the rectum) will have colon cancer (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Most patients with either Crohn&#x2019;s disease or ulcerative colitis have long periods of well-being interspersed with short intervals of illness. Medical treatment for both of these types of IBD is aimed at inducing disease remission, using a management process called induction therapy, and preventing flare-ups of the disease process while maximizing quality of life, using a management process called maintenance therapy (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3027">Basson, 2019b; Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3106">Rubin, Ananthakrishnan, Siegel, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>). Pharmacologic therapy is indicated to meet the goals of inducing and maintaining remission of IBD.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1755">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aminosalicylates such as sulfasalazine are typically the first pharmacologic agents selected to induce and maintain remission of mild to moderate IBD (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wilhelm &#x0026; Love, 2017</a>). Sulfa-free aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine, balsalazide) are indicated for patients with sulfa allergies; these drugs tend to be better tolerated by most patients, including those without sulfa allergies, and are effective in preventing and treating recurrence of inflammation. Aminosalicylates tend to be more effective agents in treating ulcerative colitis than Crohn&#x2019;s disease, although they are indicated as first-line agents for both types of IBDs (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wilhelm &#x0026; Love, 2017</a>). These drugs are administered orally or topically (by enema or rectal suppository) for patients with more distal disease involvement (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Common adverse effects of aminosalicylates include headaches, nausea, and diarrhea (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some select patients with perianal fistulas or inflammatory abdominal masses that occur from flare-ups of Crohn&#x2019;s disease may be prescribed antibiotics as first line agents, rather than aminosalicylates. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics include a combination therapy of both metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, taken orally. These drugs are not prescribed long-term, however. Therefore, another medication regimen must be selected for maintenance therapy. These antibiotics are associated with adverse effects that include nausea and diarrhea, and increased risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection. Furthermore, metronidazole can cause peripheral neuropathy that, if present, can warrant its discontinuance (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Tapering dosages of corticosteroids may be prescribed for patients who are refractory to inducing remission with other drugs such as aminosalicylates, or who are experiencing an exacerbation of the disease process (i.e., a flare-up or acute episode). These medications have potent anti-inflammatory effects (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Corticosteroids can be given orally (e.g., prednisone) in outpatient treatment or parenterally (e.g., hydrocortisone) in patients who are hospitalized. Topical (i.e., rectal administration) corticosteroids (e.g., budesonide) are widely used in the treatment of proctitis and colon disease associated with IBD. Because corticosteroids can adversely affect intestinal wound healing, they are only indicated for short-term use. Other adverse effects of corticosteroids are discussed in <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a> and summarized in <a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#tt45-3">Table 45-3</a> (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine) alter the pathologic immune response present in IBD. The exact mechanism of action of these medications in treating IBD is unclear. These agents have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing inflammation and decreasing the need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, and surgery. Because it takes at least 2 months before they are effective, these agents tend to not be used to induce remission, but are useful as maintenance therapy, particularly for patients intolerant to aminosalicylates or in those who would otherwise require long-term use of corticosteroids to maintain remission (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wilhelm &#x0026; Love, 2017</a>). These agents depress bone marrow function; therefore, the CBC must be periodically monitored for neutropenia (i.e., low WBC counts) and pancytopenia (i.e., generally low blood cells counts) that may warrant reducing the dosage or changing to a different agent (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Liver function should also be monitored periodically as these agents can be toxic to the liver (see <a href="c43.xhtml">Chapter 43</a>, <a href="c43-sec03.xhtml#tt43-1">Table 43-1</a> for Common Laboratory Tests to Assess Liver Function). These agents can be immunosuppressive, placing patients at increased risk for pneumonia and cancers. Because of these risks, adults receiving these agents should be advised to receive pneumococcal vaccination with both PCV13 and PPSV23 (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion of PCV13 and PPSV23); women should be screened for cervical cancer annually (i.e., Papanicolaou [Pap] Smear; see <a href="c50.xhtml">Chapter 50</a> for further discussion). Patients taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine should be screened annually for squamous cell carcinoma, particularly if they are over 50 years of age (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3047">Farraye, Melmed, Lichtenstein, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications incorporate monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the inflammatory effects of the cytokine TNF in the gut. These agents are indicated for use in patients with moderate to severe IBD that is refractory to treatment with immunomodulators (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wilhelm &#x0026; Love, 2017</a>). The first drug in this class that was approved for treatment of both types of IBD is infliximab. Infliximab has proven to be effective at inducing and maintaining remission of IBD, especially Crohn&#x2019;s disease. However, it must be administered by IV infusion. Infliximab is generally well tolerated by most patients, although it can rarely be associated with flulike symptoms. For those patients who experience these symptoms, premedication with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen seems to mitigate those unpleasant effects. Newer alternative anti-TNF medications include adalimumab (for both types of IBD), certolizumab (for Crohn&#x2019;s disease only), and golimubab (for ulcerative colitis only). Each of these agents may be administered by subcutaneous injections (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>). Since all of these anti-TNF agents can potentially reactivate latent viral infections, patients must be tested for tuberculosis and hepatitis B before treatment commences (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wilhelm &#x0026; Love, 2017</a>). Furthermore, all age-appropriate immunizations should be up to date prior to commencing treatment with these medications (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Farraye et al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="c03-sec05.xhtml#tt3-3">Table 3-3</a> for adult immunizations). Patients prescribed these medications over the long-term need to be educated that they are at higher risk for cancers, particularly lymphomas and melanomas (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Farraye et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wilhelm &#x0026; Love, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">During induction therapy, oral fluids and a low-residue, high-protein, high-calorie diet with supplemental vitamin therapy and iron replacement are prescribed to meet nutritional needs, reduce inflammation, and control pain and diarrhea <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1309" title="1309"></span>(<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Patients prescribed corticosteroids may require supplemental calcium and vitamin D to prevent osteopenia (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Fluid and electrolyte imbalances from dehydration caused by diarrhea are corrected by IV therapy as necessary if the patient is hospitalized, or by oral fluids if the patient is managed at home. Any foods that cause or exacerbate bothersome symptoms, such as bloating or diarrhea, are avoided. Cold foods and smoking are avoided because both increase intestinal motility. Some patients may experience an improvement in symptoms if they follow the FODMAP diet that is commonly indicated for patients with IBS (see previous discussion), while others experience symptomatic improvement by restricting intake of milk and treating lactose intolerance (see Chart 41-3) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">DeLegge, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Once remission is induced, patients with IBD are educated to avoid food triggers and maintain a diet that best meets their nutritional needs. Probiotic supplements (e.g., <em>Escherichia coli Nissle, Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em>) might be indicated to maintain remission in patient with ulcerative colitis, but have not been found to be similarly effective in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3030">Bischoff, Escher, Hebuterne, et al., 2020</a>). Most patients who achieve remission need not restrict fiber during maintenance therapy (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">DeLegge, 2020</a>). A consultation with a dietician may be indicated (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bischoff et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with IBD are at risk for becoming malnourished. Fewer patients with IBD are malnourished and require intensive nutritional therapy than was the case 30 years ago (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">DeLegge, 2020</a>). In general, patients with IBD who have lost more than 10% of their lean body mass are considered malnourished, and are at risk for increased morbidity (e.g., infections, poor wound healing). These patients may require intensive nutritional therapy, which might include enteral nutrition (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>) or parenteral nutrition (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">DeLegge, 2020</a>). Oral nutrition or enteral nutrition is generally preferable to parenteral nutrition. However, parenteral nutrition may be indicated for patients intolerant of oral and enteral nutrition, or those with bowel obstruction or short bowel syndrome, or in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease and proximal fistula formation (see later discussion of parenteral nutrition) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bischoff et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When nonsurgical measures fail to relieve severe symptoms of IBD, surgery may be necessary. Nearly one third of patients with severe ulcerative colitis and between 60% and 70% of patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease require surgery (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>). Common indications for surgery in patients with ulcerative colitis include the presence of colon cancer or colonic dysplasia/polyps (see later discussion); megacolon; severe, intractable bleeding; or perforation (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>). The most common indication for surgery in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease is small bowel obstruction, which occurs in 30% to 50% of patients; other indications for surgery include abscess, perforation, hemorrhage, or fistula formation (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghazi, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn&#x2019;s disease may require surgery to relieve strictures. A common procedure performed for strictures of the small bowel is laparoscope-guided strictureplasty, in which blocked or narrowed sections of the intestines are widened, leaving the intestines intact. In some cases, a small bowel resection is performed; diseased segments of the small intestines are resected, and the remaining portions of the intestines are anastomosed. Surgical removal of up to 80% of the small bowel usually can be tolerated (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gilroy, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients with severe Crohn&#x2019;s disease may benefit from an intestinal transplant. This technique is now available to children and to young and middle-aged adults who have lost intestinal function from disease. It may improve quality of life for some patients. The associated technical and immunologic problems remain formidable, and the costs and mortality rates continue to be high (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gilroy, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Proctocolectomy and Total Colectomy with Ileostomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Proctocolectomy (i.e., surgical excision of the colon and rectum) with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ileostomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical opening into the ileum by means of a stoma to allow drainage of bowel contents; one type of fecal diversion">ileostomy</button></strong> (i.e., a surgical opening into the ileum by means of a stoma to allow drainage of bowel contents) is recommended in the patient with IBD with a severely diseased colon and rectum that is refractory to medical therapy. This surgery cures the disease in patients with ulcerative colitis; however surgical cure is not possible with Crohn&#x2019;s disease (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Ghazi, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Walfish, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An ileostomy is a type of fecal diversion that allows for drainage of fecal matter, called <em>effluent</em>, from the ileum to the outside of the body. The drainage is liquid to unformed and occurs at frequent intervals. Nursing management of the patient with an ileostomy is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">An ileostomy is indicated after a proctocolectomy or a total colectomy (i.e., surgical excision of the entire colon) and is either temporary or permanent. For patients with severe ulcerative colitis, restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of choice. This option is not generally recommended for patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease, however, as the surgically formed ileal pouch frequently becomes diseased in these patients. A permanent ileostomy is typically indicated for the patient with Crohn&#x2019;s disease who must have a total colectomy.</p>
<p class="h7">Restorative Proctocolectomy with Ileal Pouch Anal Anastomosis</p>
<p class="nonindent">A restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA is the surgical procedure of choice in cases where the rectum can be preserved because it eliminates the need for a permanent ileostomy. It establishes an ileal reservoir that functions as a &#x201C;new&#x201D; rectum, and anal sphincter control of elimination is retained. The procedure involves connecting the ileum to the anal pouch (made from a small intestine segment), and the surgeon connects the pouch to the anus in conjunction with removing the colon and the rectal mucosa (i.e., total abdominal colectomy and mucosal proctectomy) (see <a href="#ff41-6">Fig. 41-6</a>). A temporary diverting loop ileostomy that promotes healing of the surgical anastomoses is constructed at the time of surgery and closed about 3 months later.</p>
<p class="indent">With IPAA or restorative proctocolectomy, the diseased colon and rectum are removed, voluntary defecation is maintained, and anal continence is preserved. The ileal reservoir decreases the number of bowel movements significantly. Nighttime elimination is gradually reduced to one bowel movement. Complications of ileoanal anastomosis include irritation of the perianal skin from leakage of fecal contents, stricture formation at the anastomosis site, pelvic abscess, fistula, small bowel obstruction, and <em>pouchitis</em> (i.e., inflammation of the ileoanal pouch) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3122">Wu, Ke, Kiran, et al., 2020</a>). This <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1310" title="1310"></span>procedure involves pelvic dissection; therefore, it is also associated with the risk of infertility in women. Women wanting to become pregnant may want to consider other treatment options (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). Dietary intolerances may persist after the IPAA is formed. Increased stool output, flatulence, and perineal irritation are associated with consumption of nuts, corn, chocolate, spicy foods, onions, and citrus fruits. Consequently, some patients may need to alter their diet to avoid complications and perineal breakdown.</p>

A temporary loop ileostomy diverts effluent for several months to allow healing.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Continent Ileostomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">The procedure consists of a proctocolectomy, with 30 to 45 cm of the terminal ileum used to create a J- or S-shaped continent ileal reservoir (i.e., Kock pouch) by diverting a portion of the distal ileum to the abdominal wall and creating a stoma. This procedure eliminates the need for an external fecal collection bag. A nipple valve is created by pulling a portion of the terminal ileal loop back into the ileum. GI effluent can accumulate in the pouch for several hours and then be removed by means of a catheter inserted through the nipple valve. Possible indications for a total colectomy with Kock pouch placement (rather than a restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA) include a badly diseased rectum, lack of rectal sphincter tone, or inability to achieve fecal continence post IPAA (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3122">Wu et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Variations on the Kock pouch include the Barnett continent intestinal reservoir and T-pouch (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wu et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The major challenge with the Kock pouch is malfunction of the nipple valve, which often requires additional corrective surgery. Other potential postoperative complications include fistulas, stoma-related problems (strictures, parastomal hernia, difficulty with catheterization), pouchitis, and short-bowel syndrome (i.e., nutritional deficits that occur from loss of part of the small intestines). Kock pouches are used less commonly because they have greater complication rates than does restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wu et al., 2020</a>). A major advantage of the procedure is potential improved body image and lack of external drainage appliance (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Wu et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse obtains a health history to identify the onset, duration, and characteristics of abdominal pain; the presence of diarrhea, fecal urgency, or tenesmus; nausea, anorexia, or weight loss; and family history of IBD. It is important to discuss dietary patterns and smoking habits. The nurse asks about patterns of bowel elimination, including character, frequency, and presence of blood, pus, fat, or mucus. Allergies and food intolerance, especially milk (lactose) intolerance, must be noted. The patient may identify sleep disturbances if diarrhea or pain occurs at night.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Diarrhea associated with the inflammatory process</p>

<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Electrolyte imbalance</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias related to electrolyte imbalances</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1rLast"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perforation of the bowel</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include attainment of normal bowel elimination patterns, relief of abdominal pain and cramping, prevention of fluid volume deficit, maintenance of optimal nutrition and weight, avoidance of fatigue, reduction of anxiety, promotion of effective coping, absence of skin breakdown, increased knowledge about the disease process and self-health management, and avoidance of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> N<small>ORMAL</small> E<small>LIMINATION</small> P<small>ATTERNS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse assists the patient in determining if there is a relationship between diarrhea and certain foods, activities, or emotional stressors. Identifying precipitating factors, the frequency of bowel movements, and the character, consistency, and amount of stool passed is important. The nurse provides ready access to a bathroom, commode, or bedpan <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1311" title="1311"></span>and keeps the environment clean and odor free. It is important to administer antidiarrheal medications as prescribed. Loperamide may be prescribed 30 minutes before meals (see previous discussion on interventions for diarrhea). The nurse should record the frequency and consistency of stools after therapy is initiated.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The character of the pain is described as dull, burning, or crampy. It is important to ask about its onset. Does it occur before or after meals, during the night, or before elimination? Is the pattern constant or intermittent? Is it relieved with medications? The nurse administers analgesic agents as prescribed for pain. Position changes, local application of heat (as prescribed), diversional activities, and prevention of fatigue also are helpful for reducing pain.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> F<small>LUID</small> I<small>NTAKE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">To detect fluid volume deficit, the nurse keeps an accurate record of intake and output. The nurse monitors daily weights for fluid gains or losses and assesses the patient for signs of fluid volume deficit (i.e., dry skin and mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, oliguria, fatigue, decreased temperature, increased hematocrit, elevated urine specific gravity, and hypotension). It is important to encourage oral intake of fluids and to monitor the flow rate of any IV fluids. The nurse initiates measures to decrease diarrhea (e.g., dietary restrictions, stress reduction, antidiarrheal agents).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> O<small>PTIMAL</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing interventions focus on optimizing the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and include ensuring that the patient maintains adequate intake of fluids and nutrients and recognizes and avoids foods that exacerbate symptoms (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">DeLegge, 2020</a>). The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s nutrition, including usual dietary habits, changes in appetite and body mass index (BMI) and trends in weight loss or gain (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for further discussion of nutritional assessment). Laboratory studies to detect vitamin and mineral deficiencies may help identify the need for supplementation, especially vitamin D and B<sub>12</sub> (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rowe, 2020</a>). During the induction therapy, if oral foods are tolerated, small, frequent, low-residue feedings are given to avoid overdistending the stomach and stimulating peristalsis. For the patient with IBD who is malnourished and hospitalized, enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition may be prescribed (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for further discussion of enteral nutrition). Parenteral nutrition is indicated in patients who have short-bowel syndrome, bowel obstruction, or Crohn&#x2019;s disease with severe malnutrition and intolerance to enteral nutrition and who are expected to likely remain intolerant to enteral nutrition for more than 1 to 2 weeks (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">DeLegge, 2020</a>) (see later discussion on parenteral nutrition in this chapter).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> R<small>EST</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse recommends intermittent rest periods during the day and schedules or restricts activities to conserve energy and reduce the metabolic rate. It is important to encourage activity within the limits of the patient&#x2019;s capacity. The nurse suggests naps and periods of bed rest for a patient who is febrile, has frequent diarrheal stools, or is bleeding. However, the patient should perform active exercises to maintain muscle tone and prevent venous thromboembolic complications. If the patient cannot perform these active exercises, the nurse performs passive exercises and joint range of motion. Activity restrictions are modified as needed on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Anxiety is nearly twice as prevalent in individuals with IBD than in the general population. The prevalence of anxiety in patients with IBD is not dependent upon whether or not the disease is active or in remission (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Farraye et al., 2017</a>). Therefore, the nurse must recognize that the patient with IBD may experience anxiety throughout the spectrum of disease; that is, during periods of remission as well as exacerbation. Rapport can be established by being attentive and displaying a calm, confident manner. The nurse allows time for the patient to ask questions and express feelings. Careful listening and sensitivity to nonverbal indicators of anxiety (e.g., restlessness, tense facial expressions) are helpful. The patient may be emotionally labile because of the consequences of the disease and the uncertainty of exacerbations with complications. The nurse tailors information about possible impending surgery to the patient&#x2019;s level of understanding and desire for detail. If surgery with placement of a stoma is planned, photographs, illustrations, websites, and blogs help explain the surgical procedure and help the patient visualize what a stoma looks like.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> C<small>OPING</small> M<small>EASURES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because the patient may feel isolated, helpless, and out of control, understanding and emotional support are essential. The patient may respond to stress in a variety of ways that may alienate others (e.g., anger, denial, social self-isolation).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse needs to recognize that the patient&#x2019;s behavior may be affected by a number of factors. Any patient suffering the discomforts of frequent bowel movements and rectal soreness is anxious, discouraged, and unhappy. It is important to develop a relationship with the patient that supports their attempts to cope with these stressors. It is also important to communicate that the patient&#x2019;s feelings are understood by encouraging the patient to talk and express their feelings and to discuss any concerns. Stress reduction measures that may be used include relaxation techniques, visualization, breathing exercises, and biofeedback. Professional counseling may be needed to help the patient and family manage issues associated with chronic illness and resulting disability.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> S<small>KIN</small> B<small>REAKDOWN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse examines the patient&#x2019;s skin frequently, especially the perianal skin. Perianal care, including the use of a skin barrier (e.g., petroleum ointment), is important after each bowel movement. The nurse gives immediate attention to reddened or irritated areas over bony prominences and uses pressure-relieving devices to prevent skin breakdown. Consultation with a wound-ostomy-continence (WOC) nurse (or WOCN; a nurse specially educated in the management of a variety of fecal and urinary diversions) is often helpful.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Serum electrolyte levels are monitored daily, and electrolyte replacements are given as prescribed. Evidence of arrhythmias or changes in level of consciousness must be reported immediately.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse closely monitors rectal bleeding and administers blood component therapy and volume expanders as prescribed to prevent hypovolemia. It is important to monitor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1312" title="1312"></span>the blood pressure for hypotension and to obtain coagulation profiles and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels frequently. Vitamin K may be prescribed to increase clotting factors.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse closely monitors the patient for indications of perforation (i.e., acute increase in abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, vomiting, or hypotension) and obstruction and toxic megacolon (i.e., abdominal distention, decreased or absent bowel sounds, change in mental status, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of the disease process and their need for additional information about medical management (e.g., medications, diet) and surgical interventions. The nurse provides information about nutritional management and foods that might relieve symptoms and decrease diarrhea (e.g., FODMAP diet). It is important to explain the rationale for the use of corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antidiarrheal medications. The nurse emphasizes the importance of taking medications as prescribed and not abruptly discontinuing them (especially corticosteroids) to avoid development of serious medical problems (see Chart 41-5). Patients over the age of 50 should be educated about the importance of receiving the herpes zoster vaccination; all patients should receive the influenza vaccination annually (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Farraye et al., 2017</a>). Patient education information can be obtained from the Crohn&#x2019;s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) and from a patient skills education program developed by the American College of Surgeons (see Resources section).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> For patients who have been hospitalized to treat IBD, readmission rates are as high as 18% at 30 days, and as high as 36% at 90 days (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3090">Nguyen, Koola, Dulai, et al., 2020</a>). Overall, readmission rates were higher for patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease than for those with ulcerative colitis. The most common reasons for rehospitalization were IBD flare-ups, infections, postoperative complications, pain management, or need for parenteral nutrition or surgery (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>). Risk factors for readmission include history of chronic disease, psychiatric comorbidities, smoking, and opioid dependence (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3039">Cohen-Mekekburg, Rosenblatt, Wallace, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3049">George, Martin, Gupta, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3077">Micic, Gaetano, Rubin, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>). Patients treated at large centers with IBD specialty departments tend to have lower rates of readmission (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">George et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients with IBD are managed at home with follow-up care by their primary provider or through an outpatient clinic. Those whose nutritional status is compromised and who are receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition need the home health or transitional care nurse to consult and ensure that their nutritional requirements are being met and that they or their caregivers can follow through with the instructions for maintaining the nutrition plan. Patients who are undergoing medical treatment need to understand that their disease can be controlled and that they can lead a healthy life between exacerbations. Control implies management based on an understanding of the disease and its treatment. Patients in the home or transitional setting need information about their medications (i.e., name, dose, side effects, and frequency of administration) and need to take medications on schedule. Medication reminders such as containers that separate pills according to day and time or daily checklists are helpful.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During a flare-up, the nurse encourages the patient to rest as needed and to modify activities according to their energy level. Patients should limit tasks that impose strain on the lower abdominal muscles. They should sleep in a room close to the bathroom because of the frequent diarrhea; quick access to a toilet helps alleviate worry about having an &#x201C;accident.&#x201D; Room deodorizers help control odors.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Dietary modifications can control but do not cure the disease; the nurse recommends a low-residue, high-protein, high-calorie diet, especially during an acute phase. It is important to encourage the patient to keep a record of the foods that irritate the bowel and to avoid them and to drink at least eight glasses of water each day.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The prolonged nature of the disease has an impact on the patient and often strains their family life and financial resources. Family support is vital; however, some family members may be resentful or feel guilty, tired, or unable to cope <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1313" title="1313"></span>with the emotional demands of the illness and the physical demands of providing care. Some patients with IBD do not socialize for fear of being embarrassed. Because they have lost control over elimination, they may fear losing control over other aspects of their lives. They need time to express their fears and frustrations. Individual and family counseling may be helpful.</p>

<p class="SPH1" id="sec16"><strong>DELIVERING NUTRITION PARENTERALLY</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;parenteral nutrition:&lt;/b&gt; method of supplying nutrients to the body by an intravenous route">Parenteral nutrition</button></strong> is a method of providing nutrients to the body by an IV route. The nutrients are a complex admixture containing proteins, carbohydrates, fats, electrolytes, vitamins, trace minerals, and sterile water in a single container. The goals of parenteral nutrition are similar to the goals of enteral feedings (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>); namely, to improve nutritional status, establish a positive nitrogen balance, maintain muscle mass, promote weight maintenance or gain, and enhance the healing process (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Seres, 2020</a>). Parenteral nutrition is indicated in adults who are malnourished or at risk for becoming malnourished and who cannot tolerate receiving nutrition orally or by the enteral route (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3121">Worthington, Balint, Bechtold, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1756">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Establishing Positive Nitrogen Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most IV fluids do not provide sufficient calories or protein to meet the body&#x2019;s daily requirements. Parenteral nutrition solutions can provide enough calories and nitrogen to meet the patient&#x2019;s daily nutritional needs. The patient with fever, trauma, burns, major surgery, or hypermetabolic disease requires additional daily calories (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>). When highly concentrated dextrose is given, caloric requirements are satisfied and the body uses amino acids for protein synthesis rather than for energy. Additionally, electrolytes such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sodium chloride are added to the solution to maintain proper electrolyte balance and to transport glucose and amino acids across cell membranes.</p>
<p class="indent">The volume of fluid necessary to provide these calories peripherally can surpass fluid tolerance. To provide the required calories in a smaller volume, it is necessary to increase the concentration of nutrients and use a route of administration that rapidly dilutes incoming nutrients to the proper levels of body tolerance. Typically, a large, high-flow vein such as the superior vena cava (at the right atriocaval junction) is the preferred site (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Worthington et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Recognizing Clinical Indications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The indications for parenteral nutrition include an inability to ingest at least 50% of the daily required calories and nutrients within a 7-day timeframe for adults who are physiologically stable and well nourished, and within a 3- to 5-day time frame for adults who are malnourished. Enteral nutrition should be considered before parenteral support because it assists in maintaining gut mucosal integrity and improved immune function and is typically associated with fewer complications (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Worthington et al., 2017</a>). In both the home and hospital setting, parenteral nutrition is indicated in the situations listed in <a href="#tt41-6">Table 41-6</a>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Administering Formulas</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A total of 1 to 3 L of solution is given over a 24-hour period. The label of the solution is verified by at least two identifiers and compared with the prescription (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3056">Guenter, Worthington, Ayers, et al., 2018</a>). When parenteral nutrition is delivered as a <em>2-in-1</em> admixture of dextrose and amino acids, they are typically supplemented with a <strong>lipid injectable emulsion (ILE</strong>; also called intravenous fat emulsions [IVFE] or lipid). The dextrose and amino acid solution should be administered using a 0.22-micron in-line filter, and the ILE should be administered using a 1.2-micron in-line filter. The ILE may be administered in the same IV line as the 2-in-1 solution; however, a Y-connector should be used for the ILE, and the connector should be placed closer to the patient so that it bypasses the 0.22-micron filter. The 2-in-1 solution is not to be piggybacked into the ILE. As an alternative, the ILE may be delivered via a separate IV line from the 2-in-1 solution (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Guenter et al., 2018</a>). Usually, 500 mL of a 10% ILE or 250 mL of 20% ILE is given over 6 to 12 hours, one to three times a week. ILEs can provide up to 30% of the total daily calorie intake.</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Before a parenteral nutrition infusion is administered, the solution must be inspected for separation, oily appearance (also known as a &#x201C;cracked solution&#x201D;), or any precipitate (which appears as white crystals). If any of these are present, the solution is not used.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">ILEs can be mixed by the pharmacy staff with other components of parenteral nutrition to create a <em>3-in-1</em> admixture commonly called a <strong>total nutrient admixture (TNA)</strong>. TNA is delivered using a 1.2-micron filter to prevent the administration of a precipitate (i.e., calcium, phosphorus, incompatibilities) that cannot be seen due to the opacity of the solution (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Guenter et al., 2018</a>). Advantages of TNA over parenteral nutrition are cost savings in preparation and equipment, decreased risk of catheter or nutrient contamination, decreased nursing time, and increased patient convenience and satisfaction (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gervasio, 2015</a>). Ideally, the pharmacist, nutritionist, and primary provider should collaborate to determine the specific formula needed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Initiating Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Parenteral nutrition solutions are initiated slowly and advanced gradually each day to the desired rate as the patient&#x2019;s fluid and dextrose tolerance permits. The patient&#x2019;s laboratory test results and response to parenteral nutrition therapy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the primary provider. These parameters include the patient&#x2019;s weight, intake and output, blood glucose, CBC, and chemistry panel, including serum carbon dioxide, magnesium, phosphorus, and triglycerides. A 24-hour urine collection for nitrogen may be done to analyze nitrogen balance. In most hospitals, admixture solutions are prescribed on a daily standard parenteral nutrition form. The formulation of the parenteral nutrition solutions is calculated carefully each day to meet the complete nutritional needs of the individual patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Parenteral Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Various vascular access devices are used to administer parenteral nutrition solutions in clinical practice. Parenteral nutrition may be given through either peripheral or central IV lines, depending on the patient&#x2019;s condition and the anticipated length of therapy.</p>
<p class="h7">Peripheral Method</p>
<p class="nonindent">To supplement oral intake, peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) may be prescribed. PPN is given through a peripheral vein; this is possible because the solution is less hypertonic than a full-calorie parenteral nutrition solution. PPN formulas are not nutritionally complete because of their low dextrose content. ILEs are given simultaneously to buffer the PPN and to protect the peripheral vein from irritation. The usual length of therapy using PPN is 5 to 7 days.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Formulations with dextrose concentrations of more than 10% should not be given through peripheral veins because they irritate the intima (innermost walls) of small veins, causing chemical phlebitis.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Central Method</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because central parenteral nutrition solutions have at least five times the solute concentration of blood (and exert an osmotic pressure of about 2000 mOsm/L), they are given into the vascular system through a catheter inserted into a high-flow, large blood vessel, ideally at the superior vena cava/right atriocaval junction (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Worthington et al., 2017</a>). Concentrated solutions are then very rapidly diluted to isotonic levels by the blood in this vessel.</p>
<p class="indent">Several types of <strong>central venous access devices (CVADs)</strong> are available: percutaneous (or nontunneled), peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), surgically placed (or tunneled) catheters, and implanted vascular access ports.</p>
<p class="h8">Percutaneous (Nontunneled) Central Catheters</p>
<p class="nonindent">Percutaneous central catheters are used for short-term (less than 6 weeks) IV therapy in acute care settings. The subclavian vein is the most common vessel accessed because the subclavian area provides a stable insertion site to which the catheter can be anchored, is easily compressible (facilitating control of hemorrhage), allows the patient freedom of movement, and provides easy access to the dressing site. The subclavian access site should be avoided in patients with advanced kidney disease and those on hemodialysis to prevent subclavian vein stenosis. The second most common access sites include the basilic, brachial, or cephalic veins in the arm followed by the jugular vein. The femoral vein should be avoided for this purpose and should only be used as a last resort because of concerns about infection (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3055">Gorski, Hadaway, Hagle, et al., 2016</a>). For a patient with limited IV access, a triple-lumen catheter can be used because it offers three ports for various uses (see <a href="#ff41-7">Fig. 41-7</a>). The use of a single-lumen catheter dedicated for the administration of parenteral nutrition is not typically feasible, because most patients require administration of medications and fluids in addition to parenteral nutrition, and the line used to administer parenteral nutrition cannot be used for other purposes (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gorski et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When a patient requires IV access for parenteral nutrition, the insertion procedure is first explained so that the patient is aware of what to expect. The patient is placed supine in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1315" title="1315"></span>Trendelenburg position to produce dilation of neck and shoulder vessels, which makes insertion easier and decreases the risk of air embolus. The skin is cleansed with 2% chlorhexidine to remove surface oils. To afford maximal accuracy in the placement of the catheter, the patient is instructed to turn their head away from the site of venipuncture and to remain motionless while the catheter is inserted and the wound is dressed. The nurse maintains the sterile field and supports the patient throughout the procedure. Maximal barrier precautions mandate that full-body sterile drapes are applied and sterile gloves, cap, gown, and masks are donned to reduce risk of central line&#x2013;associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3116">The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [SHEA] Guideline Central, 2015</a>) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, Chart 11-2). Lidocaine is injected to anesthetize the skin and underlying issues. A large-bore needle on a syringe is inserted and moved parallel to and beneath the clavicle until it enters the vein. A radiopaque wire is inserted through the needle into the vein. The catheter is then advanced over the wire, the needle is withdrawn, and the hub of the catheter is attached to the IV tubing. Until the syringe is detached from the needle and the catheter is inserted, the patient may be asked to perform the Valsalva maneuver. The patient is instructed to take a deep breath, hold it, and bear down with the mouth closed to produce a positive phase in central venous pressure, thereby lessening the possibility of air being drawn into the circulatory system (air embolism). The catheter is sutured to the skin. A chlorhexidine-impregnated disc or gel with a semipermeable transparent dressing is applied using sterile technique (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gorski et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff41-7">

The catheter is threaded through the subclavian vein into the vena cava/right atriocaval junction. Each lumen is an avenue for solution administration. The lumens are secured with threaded needleless adapters or Luer lock&#x2013;type caps when the device is not in use.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The position of the tip of the catheter is verified with x-ray or fluoroscopy to confirm its location in the superior vena cava at the junction of the right atrium and to rule out a pneumothorax resulting from inadvertent puncture of the pleura. Once the catheter&#x2019;s position is confirmed, the prescribed central parenteral nutrition solution can be started. The initial rate of infusion is usually low, and the rate is gradually increased to the target rate.</p>
<p class="indent">An injection cap is attached to the end of each central catheter lumen, creating a closed system. IV infusion tubing is connected to the insertion cap of the central catheter with a threaded needleless adapter or Luer lock device. To ensure patency, all lumens are initially flushed according to institution policy with a 10-mL syringe. Smaller-volume syringes are not to be used because the pressure from smaller syringes is potentially harmful to the catheter. Lumens are flushed with normal saline or diluted heparin (10 U/mL) after each intermittent infusion and after blood drawing; this flushing is necessary daily when the catheter is not in use. Force is never used to flush the catheter (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gorski et al., 2016</a>). If resistance is met, aspiration may restore lumen patency; if this is not effective, the primary provider is notified. Low-dose tissue plasminogen activator may be prescribed to dissolve a clot or fibrin sheath. If attempts to clear the lumen are ineffective, the catheter should be changed.</p>
<p class="h8">Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters <img class="m" src="images/watch.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfca64124937" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Assessing a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Site</b></p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs)</strong> are used for intermediate-term (several days to months) IV therapy in the hospital, long-term care, or home setting. These catheters may be inserted at the bedside or in the outpatient setting by a primary provider or specially trained nurse. The basilic, brachial, or cephalic vein is accessed above the antecubital space, and the catheter is threaded to the superior vena cava/right atriocaval junction (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec07.xhtml#ff12-6">Fig. 12-6</a>). Taking of blood pressure and blood specimens from the extremity with the PICC is avoided.</p>
<p class="h8">Surgically Placed (Tunneled) Central Catheters</p>
<p class="nonindent">Surgically placed central catheters are for long-term use and may remain in place for many years. These catheters are cuffed and can have single or double lumens; examples are the Power line (Power injectable), Hickman, Groshong, and Permacath. These catheters are inserted surgically. They are threaded (or tunneled) under the skin (reducing the risk of ascending infection) to the subclavian vein and advanced into the superior vena cava.</p>
<p class="h8">Implanted Vascular Access Ports <img class="m" src="images/watch.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfcb9f183c63" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Accessing an Implanted Port</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Implanted vascular access ports are also used for long-term IV therapy; examples include the Power injectable Port-A-Cath, Mediport, Hickman Port, and P.A.S. Port. Instead of exiting from the skin, the end of the catheter is attached to a small chamber that is placed in a subcutaneous pocket, either on the anterior chest wall or on the forearm. The port requires minimal care and allows the patient complete freedom of activity. Implanted ports are more expensive than the external catheters, and access requires passing a special noncoring needle (Huber tipped) through the skin into the chamber to initiate IV therapy (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#ff12-3">Fig. 12-3</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Discontinuing Parenteral Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The parenteral nutrition solution is discontinued gradually to allow the patient to adjust to decreased levels of glucose. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1316" title="1316"></span>If the parenteral nutrition solution is abruptly terminated, isotonic dextrose can be given at the same rate the parenteral nutrition solution was infusing for 1 to 2 hours to prevent rebound hypoglycemia. Symptoms of rebound hypoglycemia include weakness, faintness, sweating, shakiness, feeling cold, confusion, and increased heart rate. Once IV therapy is completed, the percutaneous central venous catheter or PICC is removed, pressure is held until hemostasis is achieved, and an occlusive dressing is applied to the exit site. Surgically placed central catheters and implanted vascular access ports are removed only by the primary provider.</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse assists in identifying patients unable to tolerate oral or enteral feedings who may be candidates for parenteral nutrition. Indicators include significant weight loss (10% or more of usual weight), a decrease in oral food intake for more than 1 week, muscle wasting, decreased tissue healing, abnormal urea nitrogen excretion, and persistent vomiting and diarrhea (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">McClave et al., 2016</a>). The nurse carefully monitors the patient&#x2019;s hydration status, electrolyte levels, and calorie intake.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional intake associated with inadequate oral intake of nutrients</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The most common complications are pneumothorax, air embolism, a clotted or displaced catheter, sepsis, hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and rebound hypoglycemia. These problems and the associated collaborative interventions are described in <a href="#tt41-7">Table 41-7</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient receiving parenteral nutrition may include optimal level of nutrition, absence of infection, adequate fluid volume, optimal level of activity (within individual limitations), knowledge of and skill in self-care, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> O<small>PTIMAL</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A continuous, uniform infusion of parenteral nutrition solution over a 24-hour period is desired. However, in some cases (e.g., home care patients), cyclic parenteral nutrition may be appropriate. Cyclic parenteral nutrition is infused during a set period of time. The time periods for infusion are sufficient to meet the patient&#x2019;s nutritional and pharmacologic needs. Ideally, cyclic parenteral nutrition is infused over a 10- to 14-hour period that continues through the night (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Worthington et al., 2017</a>). The cyclic parenteral nutrition is titrated up during the beginning of the infusion cycle and down at the conclusion of the infusion to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is initially weighed daily (this may be decreased to 2 or 3 times per week once stable) at the same time of the day under the same conditions for accurate comparison. Under the parenteral nutrition regimen, satisfactory weight maintenance or gain can usually be achieved. It is important to keep accurate intake and output records and calculations of fluid balance. A calorie count is kept of any oral nutrients. Trace elements (copper, zinc, chromium, manganese, and selenium) are included in parenteral nutrition solutions and are individualized for each patient.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> I<small>NFECTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The high dextrose and fat content of parenteral nutrition solutions makes them an ideal culture medium for bacterial and fungal growth, and CVADs provide a port of entry. Gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and <em>Candida</em> species are frequently isolated as causes of CLABSI. Common organisms include <em>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter</em> species, and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Meticulous aseptic technique is essential to prevent infection any time the IV line setup is manipulated.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The skin and the catheter hub are the major sources for CLABSIs. The catheter site is covered with a chlorhexidine disc or gel and semipermeable transparent film dressing. The semipermeable transparent dressing allows frequent examination of the catheter site, adheres well to the skin, and is more comfortable for the patient. The transparent semipermeable membrane CVAD dressing is changed every 7 days unless the dressing is damp, bloody, loose, or soiled. Alternatively, an occlusive gauze dressing may be used and is changed every 48 hours or as needed (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gorski et al., 2016</a>). During dressing changes, the nurse and patient wear masks to reduce the possibility of airborne contamination. Sterile technique is used (e.g., the nurse wears sterile gloves). The area is checked for leakage; bloody or purulent drainage; a kinked catheter; and skin reactions such as inflammation, redness, swelling, or tenderness. If chlorhexidine is used for skin asepsis, it is important to allow it to completely dry before applying the new dressing to avoid skin irritation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The catheter is another major source of colonization and infection. The use of chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine- or minocycline/rifampin-impregnated catheters is recommended for a patient whose catheter is expected to remain in place for longer than 5 days if there is concern over a possibility of the patient acquiring a CLABSI (CDC, 2017b).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> F<small>LUID</small> B<small>ALANCE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The ubiquitous use of infusion pumps ensures that an accurate rate of parenteral nutrition administration can be achieved. A designated rate is set in milliliters per hour (i.e., mL/h), and the rate is routinely verified per institution policy, generally at least every 4 hours. The infusion rate should not be increased or decreased to compensate for fluids that have infused too <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1317" title="1317"></span>quickly or too slowly. If the solution runs out, 10% dextrose and water is infused at the same rate to prevent hypoglycemia until the next parenteral nutrition solution is available for administration.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">If the rate is too rapid, hyperosmolar diuresis can occur. Excess glucose is excreted by the renal tubules, pulling large volumes of water into the tubules via osmosis, resulting in higher-than-normal urine output and intravascular fluid volume deficit. If the flow rate is too slow, the patient does not receive the maximal benefit of calories and nitrogen. Intake and output is recorded on an ongoing basis so that fluid imbalance can be readily detected.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>ENCOURAGING ACTIVITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Activities and ambulation are encouraged when the patient is physically able. With a central catheter, the patient is free to move the extremities, and normal activity should be encouraged to maintain good muscle tone.

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Successful home parenteral nutrition requires educating the patient and family in specialized skills using an intensive training program and follow-up supervision in the home. This is best accomplished through a team effort. Initiation of a home program facilitates the patient&#x2019;s discharge from the hospital.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Ideal candidates for home parenteral nutrition are patients who have a reasonable life expectancy after return home, have a limited number of illnesses other than the one that has resulted in the need for parenteral nutrition, and are highly motivated and fairly self-sufficient. Ethical dilemmas occur when the patient and family, as well as the caregiver, do not thoroughly understand what is involved in home parenteral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1318" title="1318"></span>nutrition. In addition, the ability to learn, availability of family interest and support, adequate finances, and physical plan of the home are factors that must be assessed when the decision about home parenteral nutrition is made (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Worthington et al., 2017</a>) (see Chart 41-6).</p>

Common indications for these procedures include not only IBD and diverticulitis, but also advanced colorectal cancer (see later discussion) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3061">Hendren, Hammond, Glasgow, et al., 2015</a>). Fecal diversions may be either ileostomies or colostomies, both of which may be permanent or temporary.

<h5 class="h5" id="s1757">Preoperative Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A period of preparation with replacement of fluid, blood, and protein is necessary prior to surgery. Antibiotics may be prescribed. If the patient has been taking corticosteroids (e.g., to treat IBD), they will be continued during the surgical phase to prevent steroid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Usually, the patient is given a low-residue diet, provided in frequent, small feedings. All other preoperative measures are similar to those for general abdominal surgery. The abdomen is marked for the proper placement of the stoma by the surgeon or the WOC nurse. Care is taken to ensure that the stoma is conveniently placed&#x2014;for instance, ileostomy stomas are usually placed in the right lower quadrant about 5 cm (2 inches) below the waist, in an area away from previous scars, bony prominences, skin folds, or fistulas. The stoma site must be visible to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient must have a thorough understanding of the surgery to be performed and what to expect after surgery. Preoperative education ideally should be delivered by a WOC nurse and include information about the ostomy by means of written materials, models, websites, and discussion. Preoperative education should also include management of drainage from the stoma; the nature of drainage; an introduction to use of common stoma appliances; and the need for NG intubation, parenteral fluids, and possibly perineal packing (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Francone, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1758">Postoperative Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General abdominal surgery care is required. As with other patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the nurse encourages those with an ostomy to engage in early ambulation. It is important to administer prescribed pain medications as required. The nurse observes the stoma for color and size. It should be pink to bright red and shiny. Typically, a temporary clear or transparent plastic bag (i.e., appliance or pouch) with an adhesive facing is placed over the ostomy in the operating room and firmly pressed onto the surrounding skin. The nurse monitors the ostomy for fecal drainage, which should begin about 24 to 48 hours after surgery for an ileostomy and within 3 to 6 days after surgery for a colostomy.</p>
<p class="indent">The drainage from an ileostomy is a continuous liquid from the small intestine because the stoma does not have a controlling sphincter. The contents drain into the pouch and are thus kept from coming into contact with the skin. They are collected, measured, and discarded when the pouch becomes full. If a continent ileal reservoir was created, as described for the Kock pouch, continuous drainage is provided by an indwelling reservoir catheter for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1322" title="1322"></span>This allows the suture lines to heal. Stool drainage from transverse colostomies may be soft and unformed; whereas, stool from descending and sigmoid colostomies is more solid (see <a href="#ff41-8">Fig. 41-8</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff41-8">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff41-8.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff41-8.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;41-8 &#x2022;</span> Placement of permanent colostomies. The nature of the discharge varies with the site. <em>Shaded areas</em> show sections of bowel removed. <strong>A.</strong> With a sigmoid colostomy, the feces are formed. <strong>B.</strong> With a descending colostomy, the feces are semiformed. <strong>C.</strong> With a transverse colostomy, the feces are unformed. <strong>D.</strong> With an ascending colostomy, the feces are fluid.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Because patients lose large fluid volumes in the early postoperative period, an accurate record of fluid intake and output, including fecal discharge, is necessary to help gauge each patient&#x2019;s fluid needs. Between 600 and 1200 mL of daily output from an ileostomy and between 200 and 600 mL of daily output from a colostomy can be expected (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bridges, Nasser, &#x0026; Parrish, 2019</a>). With these losses, sodium and potassium are depleted. The nurse monitors laboratory values and administers electrolyte replacements as prescribed. Fluids may be given IV for 4 to 5 days to replace lost fluids.</p>
<p class="indent">NG suction may be a part of the immediate postoperative care, with the tube requiring frequent irrigation, as prescribed. The purpose of NG suction is to prevent a buildup of gastric contents while the intestines are not functioning. After the tube is removed, the nurse offers sips of clear liquids and gradually progresses the diet. Nausea and abdominal distention, which may indicate intestinal obstruction, must be reported immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">If rectal packing has been used, it is removed by the end of the first week. Because this procedure may be uncomfortable, the nurse may administer an analgesic agent an hour before the removal. After the packing is removed, the perineum is irrigated two or three times daily until full healing takes place.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Emotional Support</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient may think that everyone is aware of the ostomy and may view the stoma as a mutilation compared with other abdominal incisions that heal and are hidden. Because there is loss of a body part and a major change in anatomy and function, the patient often goes through the phases of grief&#x2014;denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Nursing support through these phases is important, and understanding of the patient&#x2019;s emotional state should determine the approach taken. For example, education may be ineffective until the patient is ready to learn. Concern about body image may lead to questions related to family relationships, sexual function, and, for women of childbearing years, the ability to become pregnant and deliver a baby vaginally. Patients need to know that the nurse understands and cares about them; a calm, nonjudgmental attitude aids in gaining the patient&#x2019;s confidence. It is important to recognize that treatment of a possibly terminal illness (e.g., cancer) makes patients irritable, anxious, and unhappy. The nurse can coordinate patient care through meetings attended by consultants such as the primary provider, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, WOC nurse, and dietitian.</p>
<p class="indent">Conversely, a surgical procedure to create an ileostomy can produce dramatic positive changes in patients who have suffered from IBD for several years. After the discomfort of the disease has decreased and the patient learns how to take care of the ileostomy, they often develop a more positive outlook. Until the patient progresses to this phase, an empathetic and tolerant approach by the nurse plays an important part in recovery. The sooner the patient masters the physical care of the ostomy, the sooner they will psychologically accept it.</p>
<p class="indent">Support from other people with ostomies is also helpful. The United Ostomy Associations of America (UOAA) is dedicated to the rehabilitation of people with ostomies. This organization gives patients useful information about living with an ostomy through an educational program of literature, lectures, and exhibits (see Resources section at the end of this chapter). Local associations offer consultations by qualified members who provide hope and rehabilitation services to patients with new ostomies. Hospitals and other health care agencies may have a WOC nurse on staff who can serve as a valuable resource person for the patient with an ileostomy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Skin and Stoma Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with an ileostomy cannot establish regular bowel habits because the contents of the ileum are fluid and are discharged continuously. The patient must wear a pouch at all times. Stomal size and pouch size vary initially; the stoma should be rechecked 3 weeks after surgery, when the edema has subsided. The final size and type of appliance is selected in 3 months, after the patient&#x2019;s weight has stabilized and the stoma shrinks to a stable shape.</p>
<p class="indent">The incidence of complications related to a colostomy is usually less than that of an ileostomy. Postoperatively, the stoma is examined for swelling (slight edema from surgical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1323" title="1323"></span>manipulation is normal), color (a healthy stoma is pink or red), discharge (a small amount of oozing is normal), and bleeding (an abnormal sign if bright red or more than trace amounts).</p>
<p class="indent">Skin excoriation around the stoma can be a persistent problem, particularly for ileostomies. Peristomal skin integrity may be compromised by several factors, such as an allergic reaction to the ostomy appliance, skin barrier, or paste; chemical irritation from the effluent; mechanical injury from the removal of the appliance; and infection. If irritation and yeast growth occur, antifungal spray, water-based cream, or powder can be applied on the peristomal skin and a pouch with skin barrier is applied over the affected area (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Stelton, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Changing an Appliance <img class="m" src="images/watch.jpg" alt=""/></h6>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfdcf7b1f5c9" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Changing an Ostomy Appliance</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">A regular schedule for changing the appliance before leakage occurs must be established for those with an ostomy. The patient should be educated to change the pouch.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box1323"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for changing an ostomy appliance, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The amount of time a person can keep the appliance sealed to the body surface depends on the location of the stoma and on body structure. The usual wearing time, which also depends on the type of skin barrier, is 5 to 10 days. The appliance is emptied every 4 to 6 hours, or at the same time the patient empties the bladder. An emptying spout at the bottom of the appliance is closed with a special clip or Velcro closure made for this purpose. If the patient wishes to bathe or shower before putting on a clean appliance, micropore tape applied to the sides of the pouch keeps it secure during bathing.</p>
<p class="indent">Most pouches are disposable and odor proof. Foods such as spinach and parsley act as deodorizers in the intestinal tract; foods that cause odors include asparagus, cabbage, onions, and fish. Bismuth subcarbonate tablets, which may be prescribed and taken orally three or four times each day, are effective in reducing odor. Oral diphenoxylate with atropine can be prescribed to diminish intestinal motility, thereby thickening the stool and assisting in odor control. Foods such as rice, mashed potatoes, and applesauce may also thicken stool.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Irrigating a Colostomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The purpose of irrigating a colostomy is to empty the colon of gas, mucus, and feces so that the patient can go about social and business activities without fear of fecal drainage. A stoma does not have voluntary muscular control and may empty at irregular intervals. Regulating the passage of fecal material is achieved by irrigating the colostomy or allowing the bowel to evacuate naturally without irrigations. This choice depends on the person and the type of the colostomy (i.e., descending or sigmoid colostomies). By irrigating the stoma at a regular time, there is less gas and retention of the irrigant. The time for irrigating the colostomy should be consistent with the schedule that the person will follow after leaving the hospital.</p>
<p class="indent">Colostomy irrigation is not recommended for people with extensive pelvic irradiation because it carries a risk of perforation. Likewise, it is contraindicated in patients currently receiving chemotherapy, those with IBS, Crohn&#x2019;s disease, diverticulitis, and peristomal hernias (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Bauer, Arnold-Long, &#x0026; Kent, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As soon as the patient with a descending or sigmoid colostomy has established a routine for evacuation with irrigations, pouches may be dispensed with, and a closed ostomy appliance or a stoma cap is used to cover the stoma. Except for gas and a slight amount of mucus, nothing escapes from the colostomy opening between irrigations. New assistive devices and ostomy care algorithms are available to help nurses learn ostomy assessment and ostomy product selection (see Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Irrigating a Continent Ileostomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the first several days postoperatively after a continent ileostomy (i.e., Kock pouch) is created, a catheter extends from the stoma and is attached to a closed drainage suction system. To ensure patency of the catheter, the nurse instills 10 to 20 mL of normal saline gently into the pouch usually every 3 hours; return flow is not aspirated but is allowed to drain by gravity.</p>
<p class="indent">After approximately 2 weeks, when the healing process has progressed to the point at which the catheter is removed from the stoma, the patient is educated how to drain the pouch. A catheter is inserted into the reservoir to drain the fluid. The length of time between drainage periods is gradually increased until the reservoir needs to be drained only every 4 to 6 hours and irrigated once each day. A pouch is not necessary; instead, most patients wear a small dressing over the opening.</p>
<p class="indent">When the fecal discharge is thick, water can be injected through the catheter to loosen and soften it. The consistency of the effluent is affected by food intake. At first, drainage is only 60 to 80 mL, but as time goes on, the amount increases significantly. The internal Kock pouch stretches, eventually accommodating between 500 and 1000 mL. The patient learns to use the sensation of pressure in the pouch as a gauge to determine how often the pouch should be drained.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Dietary and Fluid Needs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A low-residue diet is followed for the first 6 to 8 weeks. Strained fruits and vegetables are ingested. These foods are important sources of vitamins A and C. Later, there are few dietary restrictions, except for avoiding foods that are high in fiber or hard-to-digest kernels, such as celery, popcorn, corn, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, and coconut, which may result in a stomal obstruction (food blockage) for the person with an ileostomy. Foods are reintroduced one at a time.</p>
<p class="indent">Getting enough fluids during the summer may be a challenge, when fluid lost through perspiration adds to the fluid loss through the ileostomy. Fluids such as sports drinks (Gatorade) are helpful in maintaining electrolyte balance. If the fecal discharge is too watery, fibrous foods (e.g., whole-grain cereals, fresh fruit skins, beans, corn, nuts) are restricted. If the effluent is excessively dry, salt intake is increased. Increased intake of water or fluid does not increase the effluent, because excess water is excreted in the urine.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Some older adults may require an ostomy but have difficulty managing care due to decreased vision, impaired hearing, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1324" title="1324"></span>difficulty with fine motor coordination. Skin care is a major concern in older patients with an ostomy because of the skin changes that occur with aging&#x2014;the epithelial and subcutaneous fatty layers become thin, and the skin is irritated easily (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). To prevent skin breakdown, special attention is paid to skin cleansing and the proper fit of an appliance. Stoma skin barriers should be molded into shape around the stoma (e.g., ConvaTec; see <a href="#ff41-9">Fig. 41-9</a>). Arteriosclerosis may also be an issue; it causes decreased blood flow to the wound and stoma site, which may lead to delayed nutrient transport and prolonged healing time. Some patients have delayed elimination after irrigation because of decreased peristalsis and mucus production. Most patients require 6 months before they feel comfortable with their ostomy care.</p>

Reprinted with permission of ConvaTec, Inc.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Monitoring for complications is an ongoing activity for the patient with an ostomy. Peristomal skin irritation, which results from leakage of effluent, is the most common complication of an ileostomy. A drainable pouching system that does not fit well is often the cause. Components of the drainable pouching system include the pouch, a solid skin barrier, and adhesive. The WOC nurse typically recommends the appropriate drainable pouching system. The solid skin barrier is the component of this system that is most important in ensuring healthy peristomal skin. Solid skin barriers are typically shaped as rectangular or elliptical wafers and are composed of polymers and hydrocolloids. They protect the skin around the stoma from effluent from the stoma and provide a stable interface between the stoma and the pouch. It is critical that the barrier be sized appropriately to &#x201C;hug&#x201D; the stoma (up to the stoma but not touching) and not expose peristomal skin.</p>
<p class="indent">Other common complications include diarrhea, stomal stenosis, urinary calculi, and cholelithiasis. Even in the presence of a properly fitted drainable pouching system, diarrhea can be problematic. Diarrhea, manifested by very irritating effluent that rapidly fills the pouch (every hour or sooner), can quickly lead to dehydration and electrolyte losses. Supplemental water, sodium, and potassium are given to prevent hypovolemia and hypokalemia. Antidiarrheal agents are given. Stenosis is caused by circular scar tissue that forms at the stoma site. The scar tissue must be surgically released. Urinary calculi may occur in patients with ileostomies and are at least partly attributed to dehydration from decreased fluid intake. Crohn&#x2019;s disease is a risk factor for cholelithiasis (i.e., gallstones) due to altered absorption of bile acids (see <a href="c44.xhtml">Chapter 44</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wound and ostomy care has been identified by family caregivers as one of the most challenging care responsibilities (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3068">Kirkland-Kyhn, Martin, Zaratkiewicz, et al., 2018</a>). Ostomy care can be complex and may be viewed as unpleasant by caregivers, and some patients may have body image issues (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Kirkland-Kyhn et al., 2018</a>). Nurses can provide the patient and family with information and resources prior to discharge, so they are prepared when the patient arrives home. The family should be familiar with adjustments that will be necessary; for example, they need to know why it is necessary for the patient to occupy the bathroom for 10 minutes or more at certain times of the day and why certain equipment is needed. Their understanding is necessary to reduce tension; a relaxed patient tends to have fewer problems. Visits from a home health, WOC, or transitional care nurse may be arranged to ensure that the patient is progressing as expected and to provide additional guidance and education as needed.</p>
