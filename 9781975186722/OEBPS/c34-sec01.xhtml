<h4 class="h4" id="s1342">Rheumatic Diseases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Rheumatic disease processes affect males and females of all ages and ethnic groups. Some disorders are more likely to occur at a particular time of life or to affect one gender more often than the other. In general, women are two to nine times more commonly affected by rheumatic diseases than men (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases and the physical limitations that occur with them are becoming more prominent and a larger public health issue, which can be attributed to the increased number of older adults in the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">The onset of these conditions may be acute or insidious, with a course possibly marked by periods of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;remission:&lt;/b&gt; period when disease symptoms are reduced or absent">remission</button></strong> (a period when disease symptoms are reduced or absent) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;exacerbation:&lt;/b&gt; period when disease symptoms occur or increase">exacerbation</button></strong> (a period when symptoms occur or increase). Treatment can be simple, aimed at localized relief, or it can be complex, directed toward relief of systemic effects. Permanent changes and disability may result from these disorders.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses need to understand the classification of rheumatic diseases. One system is to classify disease as either monoarticular (affecting a single joint) or polyarticular (affecting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1068" title="1068"></span>multiple joints). Another system is to classify the disease as either inflammatory or noninflammatory. This chapter focuses on inflammatory rheumatic diseases, while noninflammatory rheumatic diseases (i.e., osteoarthritis) are covered in <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>. Conditions that may secondarily affect the musculoskeletal structure are also considered in disease classification.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1343">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Each of the inflammatory rheumatic diseases exhibits unique pathophysiologic features. Three distinct characteristics of pathophysiology include inflammation, autoimmunity, and degeneration.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Inflammation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Inflammation is a complex physiologic process mediated by the immune system that occurs in response to harmful stimuli like damaged cells or antigens, which may include pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria). Inflammation is meant to protect the body from insult by removing the triggering antigen or event. In response to a triggering episode, the antigen stimulus activates the body&#x2019;s immune system to form antibodies like monocytes and T lymphocytes (also referred to as T cells). Next, the immunoglobulin antibodies form immune complexes with antigens. Phagocytosis of the immune complexes is initiated, generating an inflammatory reaction (joint effusion, pain, and edema) (see <a href="#ff34-1">Fig. 34-1</a>). Phagocytosis produces chemicals such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Leukotrienes contribute to the inflammatory process by attracting other white blood cells to the area. Prostaglandins act as modifiers to inflammation. In some cases, they increase inflammation; in other cases, they decrease it. Leukotrienes and prostaglandins produce enzymes such as collagenase that break down collagen, which is a vital part of a normal joint. The release of these enzymes in the joint causes edema and proliferation of synovial membrane. In patients with chronic inflammation, the immune response can deviate from normal. Instead of resolution of swelling and joint pain once the triggering event has subsided, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pannus:&lt;/b&gt; proliferation of newly formed synovial tissue infiltrated with inflammatory cells">pannus</button></strong> (proliferation of newly formed synovial tissue infiltrated with inflammatory cells) formation occurs. Destruction of the joint&#x2019;s cartilage and erosion of bone soon follow (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The immunologic inflammatory process begins when antigens are presented to T lymphocytes, leading to a proliferation of T and B cells. B cells (also referred to as plasma cells) are a source of antibody-forming cells. In response to specific antigens, plasma cells produce and release antibodies. Antibodies combine with corresponding antigens to form pairs, or immune complexes. The immune complexes build up and are deposited in synovial tissue or other organs in the body, triggering the inflammatory reaction that can ultimately damage the involved tissue (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Autoimmunity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A hallmark of inflammatory rheumatic diseases is autoimmunity, where the body mistakenly recognizes its own tissue as a foreign antigen. Autoimmunity leads to destruction of tissue via the same inflammatory process as discussed earlier, along with chronic and long-standing pain. Although focused in the joints, inflammation and autoimmunity also involve other areas. The blood vessels (vasculitis and arteritis), lungs, heart, and kidneys may be affected by the autoimmunity and inflammation. See <a href="c32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a> for more information on autoimmune disease. A large group of genes, called <em>human leukocyte antigen</em> (HLA) genes, has been linked to the immune <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1069" title="1069"></span>response and the development of multiple rheumatic diseases (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

ROM, range of motion.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Degeneration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In degenerative rheumatic diseases, inflammation also occurs, but as a secondary process. Although the cause of degeneration of the articular cartilage is poorly understood, the process is known to be metabolically active and therefore is more accurately called <em>degradation.</em> One theory of degradation is that genetic or hormonal influences, mechanical factors, and prior joint damage cause cartilage failure. Degradation of cartilage ensues, and increased mechanical stress on bone ends causes stiffening of bone tissue. Another theory is that bone stiffening occurs and results in increased mechanical stress on cartilage, which in turn initiates the processes of degradation. See <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a> for more information on the structure and function of the articular system.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1344">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common symptom in the rheumatic diseases is pain. Other common symptoms include joint swelling, limited movement, stiffness, weakness, and fatigue.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1345">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment begins with a general health history, which includes the onset of symptoms and how they evolved, family history, past health history, and any other contributing factors. Because many of the rheumatic diseases are chronic conditions, the health history should also include information about the patient&#x2019;s perception of the problem, previous treatments and their effectiveness, the patient&#x2019;s support systems, and the patient&#x2019;s current knowledge base and the source of that information. A complete health history is followed by a complete physical assessment (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment for rheumatic diseases combines the physical examination with a functional assessment (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Eliopoulos, 2021</a>). Inspection of the patient&#x2019;s general appearance occurs during the initial contact. Gait, posture, and general musculoskeletal size and structure are observed. Gross deformities and abnormalities in movement are noted. The symmetry, size, and contour of other connective tissues, such as the skin and adipose tissue, are also noted and recorded (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2019</a>). <a href="#ct34-1">Chart 34-1</a> outlines the important areas for consideration during the physical assessment. The functional assessment is a combination of history (what the patient reports that they can and cannot do) and examination (observation of activities, in which the patient demonstrates what they can and cannot do, such as dressing and getting in and out of a chair). Observation also includes the adaptations and adjustments the patient may have made (sometimes without awareness)&#x2014;for example, with shoulder or elbow involvement, the person may bend over to reach a fork rather than raising the fork to the mouth.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Laboratory Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In <a href="#tt34-1">Table 34-1</a> common laboratory studies are listed with their corresponding normal ranges and significance. Many of the tests require special laboratory techniques and may not be performed in every health care facility. The primary provider determines which tests are necessary based on symptoms, stage of disease, cost, and likely benefit. In some instances, tests are used to monitor the course of the disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Diagnostic Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Imaging studies commonly used for patients with rheumatic diseases include x-ray studies, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and arthrography. See <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a> for further information about these and other diagnostic studies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1346">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The chronic nature of rheumatic conditions requires cooperation between the patient and the provider. Patient education regarding the disease process and treatment options is imperative to enable patients to make informed decisions regarding their care. Management of rheumatic diseases is based on a shared decision process between the provider and patient that takes into account the patient&#x2019;s values, preferences, and comorbidities (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh, Saag, Bridges, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medications are used with the rheumatic diseases to manage symptoms, to control inflammation, and, in some instances, to modify the disease. Useful medications include the salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and both biologic and nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). As their name suggests, DMARDs have the ability to suppress the autoimmune response; alter disease progression; and stop or decrease further tissue damage on the joints, cartilage, and organs. DMARDs have been found to halt the progression of bone loss and destruction and can induce remission (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Nonbiologic DMARDs are thought to reduce proinflammatory <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytokines:&lt;/b&gt; messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)">cytokines</button></strong> (cell signaling proteins vital to regulation of hematopoiesis, apoptosis, and immune responses) and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. Biologic DMARDs, in contrast, have been specifically engineered to target a certain cell or molecule within the immune system to treat the specific rheumatic condition. Specific biologic DMARDs target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x03B1;), B cells, T cells, interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). <a href="#tt34-2">Table 34-2</a> reviews select medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Controlling the inflammation related to the disease process helps manage pain, but this is often a delayed response. Nonopioid medications are often used for pain management, especially early in the treatment program, until other measures can be instituted.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nonpharmacologic Pain Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nonpharmacologic methods of pain management are important. Heat applications are helpful in relieving pain, stiffness, and muscle spasm (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Kapale, Vardharajulu, &#x0026; Warude, 2017</a>). Superficial heat may be applied in the form of warm tub baths or showers and warm moist compresses. Paraffin baths (dips), which offer concentrated heat, are helpful to patients with wrist and small-joint involvement. Maximum benefit is achieved within 20 minutes after application. More frequent use for shorter lengths of time is most beneficial. Therapeutic exercises can be carried out more comfortably and effectively after heat has been applied (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2485">Kapale et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Devices such as braces, splints, and assistive devices for ambulation (e.g., canes, crutches, walkers) ease pain by limiting movement or stress from putting weight on painful joints. Acutely inflamed joints can be rested by applying splints to limit motion. Splints also support the joint to relieve spasm. Canes and crutches can relieve stress from inflamed and painful weight-bearing joints while promoting safe ambulation. Cervical collars may be used to support the weight of the head and limit cervical motion. A metatarsal bar or special pads may be put into the patient&#x2019;s shoes if foot pain or deformity is present. A combination of methods may be required, because different methods often work better at different times.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Exercise and Activity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ongoing nature of most rheumatic diseases makes it important to maintain and, when possible, improve joint mobility and overall functional status. Appropriate programs of exercise have been shown to decrease pain and improve function (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Eliopoulos, 2021</a>). Changes in gait as well as joint limitations commonly require referral for rehabilitation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1074" title="1074"></span>therapy. An individualized exercise program is crucial to improve movement. <a href="#tt34-3">Table 34-3</a> summarizes the exercises appropriate for patients with rheumatic diseases. Physical and occupational therapy programs and interventions are beneficial in improving physical activity and maintaining range of motion. Such interventions may include stretching exercises, muscle conditioning, aerobic exercise, massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation. Other strategies for decreasing pain include muscle relaxation techniques, imagery, self-hypnosis, and distraction. A mild analgesic agent may be suggested before exercise to improve pain during exercise. A weight reduction program may be recommended to relieve stress on painful joints for patients who are overweight. Any patient who experiences acute or prolonged pain associated with exercise should report the symptoms to their primary provider for evaluation.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The major challenge for the patient and the health care provider is the need to adjust all aspects of treatment according to the activity of the disease. Especially for the patient with an active diffuse connective tissue disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), activity levels may vary from day to day and even within a single day.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sleep</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Short-term use of low-dose antidepressant medications, such as amitriptyline, may be prescribed to reestablish adequate sleep patterns and improve pain management (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Patients need restful sleep so that they can cope with pain, minimize physical fatigue, and deal with the changes related to having a chronic disease. In patients with acute disease, sleep time is frequently reduced and fragmented by prolonged awakenings. Stiffness, depression, and medications may also compromise the quality of sleep and increase daytime fatigue. A sleep-inducing routine, medication, and comfort measures may help improve the quality of sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">Education about sleep hygiene strategies may help promote restorative sleep. These strategies include establishing a set time to sleep and a regular wake-up time, creating a quiet sleep environment with a comfortable room temperature, avoiding factors that interfere with sleep (e.g., the use of alcohol and caffeine), using relaxation exercises, and getting out of bed and engaging in another activity (e.g., reading) if unable to sleep.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1347">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Much of the care of patients with arthritis involves self-management; thus, using a standardized assessment of self-management behaviors will help plan effective on-going care and treatment targets (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2499">Oh, Han, Kim, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct34-2">Chart 34-2</a> describes one such tool. <a href="#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a> details the nursing diagnoses, interventions, and expected outcomes for the patient with a rheumatic disorder.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1348"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The various rheumatic disease conditions in the older adult pose unique challenges. These challenges relate to disability, cognitive changes, comorbid conditions, and diagnosis. Musculoskeletal problems are the most frequently reported conditions in older adults (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Eliopoulos, 2021</a>) and will be seen more frequently by health professionals in the coming years along with associated disability, especially among frail older adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Comorbid conditions pose a unique challenge in diagnosing rheumatic disease in older adults because they have the potential to mask or alter presenting symptoms. The frequency, pattern of onset, clinical features, severity, and effects on function of the rheumatic disease in older patients needs to be assessed. One study reported that functional disability was correlated with disease state and thus must be addressed in planning care (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2500">Omma, Celik, Bes, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Additional medical conditions may take precedence over the rheumatic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1075" title="1075"></span>disease, causing it to become a secondary diagnosis and concern. Decreased vision and altered balance, often present in older adults, may be problematic if rheumatic disease in the lower extremities affects locomotion. The combination of decreased hearing and visual acuity, memory loss, and depression contributes to failure to follow the treatment regimen in older adult patients as well (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Eliopoulos, 2021</a>). Special techniques for promoting patient safety, self-management, and strategies such as memory aids for medications may be necessary.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Assessing Self-Management in Patients with Arthritis</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Oh, H. S., Han, S. Y., Kim, S. H., et&#x00A0;al. (2018). Development and validity testing of an arthritis self-management assessment tool. <em>Orthopaedic Nursing</em>, <em>37</em>(1), 24&#x2013;35.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Self-management is central to arthritis treatment; yet, no instrument existed to measure arthritis self-management ability. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop and test the reliability and validity of a comprehensive tool to assess self-management in patients with arthritis.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A nonexperimental correlational design was used for this study. Items for inclusion on the Arthritis Self-Management Assessment Tool (ASMAT) were generated using a chronic illness management model. Content validity of the initial 42 items were reviewed by a panel of experts and decreased to 32 items. The tool was then tested with 150 patients with arthritis in an outpatient setting. Factor analysis was used to test construct validity.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The mean age of participants was 52 years and approximately 60% were male. There were 32 items generated and tested in the final version of the ASMAT. The 32 items were validated and the scale was found to have 3 subscales: that of medical management tasks (10 items), behavioral management tasks (13 items), and psycho-emotional management tasks (9 items). Confirmatory factor analysis showed construct validity for the 32 item tool. Cronbach &#x03B1; levels showed the overall toll and the 3 subscales to be reliable.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses are in a key position to assist patients with arthritis to self-manage their care. Performing an ASMAT helps evaluate the patient&#x2019;s self-management abilities and the effectiveness of self-management interventions. Early identification of barriers to adoption of self-management strategies can lead to improved symptom management, independence, and improved quality of life.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Behavioral clues such as gait patterns, guarding, and joint flexion may aid the nurse in assessing the patient&#x2019;s pain when cognitive impairment is present. Older adults, especially men, may also neglect to communicate their pain unless elicited by the provider. Pain, in general, in this population that is not treated or undertreated may impact the quality of life for these patients, which can exacerbate all other medical conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Pharmacologic therapy (including analgesic agents), exercise, postural assistance, modification of activities of daily living, and psychological support are useful components of a self-management program for the older adult (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2499">Oh et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Identifying the effects of the rheumatic disease on the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle, independence, and psychological status is important and can improve the quality of life for older adults. Depressed mood is routinely found in those suffering from chronic joint disease. The body image and self-esteem of the older adult with rheumatic disease, combined with underlying depression, may interfere with the use of assistive devices such as canes. The use of adaptive equipment such as long-handled reachers or tongs may be viewed by the older adult as evidence of aging rather than as a means of increasing independence.</p>
<p class="indent">Because most rheumatic diseases involve pain, especially with joints, some older adults may consider their symptoms as inevitable consequences of aging. In fact, many older adults expect and accept the immobility and self-care problems related to the rheumatic diseases and do not seek help, thinking that nothing can be done.</p>
<p class="indent">The older adult usually has a lifelong pattern of dealing with the stresses of daily life. Depending on the success of that pattern, the older adult can often maintain a positive attitude and self-esteem when faced with a rheumatic disease, especially if support is available. Previous stress management strategies are assessed. If these strategies have been effective, the patient is encouraged and supported in their use. If they were ineffective, the nurse assists the patient in identifying alternative strategies, encourages the use of new strategies, and assesses their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacologic treatment of rheumatic disease in older patients is more difficult than in younger patients. If therapeutic medications have an effect on the senses (hearing, cognition), this effect is intensified in the older adult. The cumulative effect of medications, in general, is accentuated because of the physiologic changes of aging. For example, decreased renal function in the older adult alters the metabolism of certain medications, such as NSAIDs. Older adults are more prone to side effects associated with the use of multiple-drug therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Partly because of the more frequent contact of older adults with health care providers for a variety of health issues, overtreatment or inappropriate treatment is possible. Complaints of pain may be met with a prescription for analgesic agents rather than instructions for rest, the use of an assistive device, and local comfort measures such as heat or cold. Acetaminophen may be appropriate and worth trying before other medications that pose a greater chance of side effects. NSAIDs can be used; however, long-term use of NSAIDs can increase the risks of peptic ulcers, hemorrhage, and cardiovascular toxicity (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Intra-articular corticosteroid injections, with their usually rapid relief of symptoms, may be requested by the patient who is unaware of the consequences of too-frequent use of this treatment. In addition, exercise programs may not be instituted or may be ineffective because the patient expects results to occur quickly or fails to appreciate the effectiveness of a program of exercise. In fact, strength training is encouraged in the older adult with chronic diseases.</p>
