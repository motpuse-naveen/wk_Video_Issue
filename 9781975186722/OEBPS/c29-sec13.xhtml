<h4 class="h4" id="s1165">Inherited Bleeding Disorders</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Two of the more commonplace inherited bleeding disorders include hemophilia and vWD. Each of these is discussed in the sections that follow.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1166">Hemophilia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are two forms of hemophilia: hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Both are clinically similar but are distinguishable by laboratory tests. Hemophilia A is caused by a genetic defect that results in deficient or defective factor VIII. Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, is due to a genetic defect that causes a deficiency or defect in factor IX. Hemophilia is a relatively common disease, with hemophilia A occurring in 1 of every 5000 to 7000 births. Hemophilia A is five times more common than hemophilia B (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Escobar &#x0026; Key, 2016</a>). Both hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited as X-linked traits, making both conditions much more common in males than in females. Females can be carriers of the gene but are typically asymptomatic. It is estimated that one third of cases result from spontaneous mutations rather than familial transmission (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2162">National Hemophilia Foundation, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The tendency for developing bleeding is the basis for the classification of hemophilia (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Escobar &#x0026; Key, 2016</a>):</p>
<p class="BLMFIRST"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Severe disease is defined by a plasma factor activity level of less than 1 IU/dL, or less than 1% normal factor VIII levels.</p>
<p class="BLMFIRST"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Moderate disease reflects a level of 1 to 5 IU/dL or factor VIII level between 1% and 5% of normal.</p>
<p class="BLMFIRST"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Mild disease reflects a level above 5 IU/dL or factor VIII level above 5%.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemophilia is often recognized in early childhood, usually in the toddler period. However, patients with mild hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they experience severe trauma or surgery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1167">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hemophilia is manifested by hemorrhages into various parts of the body; hemorrhages can be severe and can occur even with minimal trauma. The frequency and severity of bleeding depend on the degree of factor deficiency and the severity of the precipitating trauma. Those with mild factor deficiency rarely develop spontaneous bleeding; hemorrhage is usually associated with trauma. In contrast, spontaneous bleeding, including hemarthroses and hematomas, occur frequently in patients with severe factor deficiency (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Escobar &#x0026; Key, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">About 75% of bleeding in patients with hemophilia occurs in the joints. Joints most frequently affected include the knees, elbows, ankles, shoulders, wrists, and hips. Pain is often noticed prior to the presence of swelling and limitations in movement. Recurrent joint hemorrhages can lead to joint arthropathy that causes ankylosis and chronic pain (see <a href="#ff29-5">Fig. 29-5</a>). Patients with severe factor deficiency may become disabled due to joint damage early in life. Bleeding may be superficial as hematomas or as deep hemorrhages into muscle and subcutaneous tissue. With severe factor VIII deficiency, hematomas can occur without trauma and extend into the surrounding tissue. Hematomas in the muscles, particularly in the extremities, may cause peripheral nerve compression with impaired sensation. Over time, nerve compression may lead to weakness and atrophy of the affected area.</p>

<p class="indent">Bleeding is not limited to joints and muscles. Dental procedures, including extractions, are associated with bleeding. Spontaneous hematuria and GI bleeding may also occur. Bleeding is also common in other mucous membranes, including the nasal passages and conjunctivae as well as soft tissue. Falls in adults are particularly dangerous. Intracranial and extracranial hemorrhages are the most serious sites of bleeding. Any head trauma requires immediate evaluation and treatment. Surgical procedures often result in excessive bleeding at the surgical site. Clot formation and wound healing are often poor.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1168">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Recombinant forms of factor VIII and IX concentrates are available and decrease the need for using plasma-derived factor concentrates and fresh-frozen plasma. Concentrates are used when patients are actively bleeding; it is important that treatment is initiated as soon as possible to reduce risk for bleeding complications. Factors should be administered prophylactically prior to traumatic procedures to prevent excessive bleeding (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Escobar &#x0026; Key, 2016</a>). Children frequently receive prophylactic treatment three to four times per week to reduce risk for joint complications. The cost and challenges with adhering to the prescribed regimen may limit the effectiveness of this approach (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Thornburg &#x0026; Duncan, 2017</a>). Initiating prophylactic treatment in adolescents and young adults can also lead to positive outcomes by reducing joint complications, pain, and disability and improving quality of life (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Reding, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor concentrates is a significant complication of factor replacement therapy. Up to 33% of patients with hemophilia A and 3% of patients with hemophilia B develop antibodies to factor concentrates (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Reding, 2018</a>). The presence of these inhibitors may be transient; however, the effects may be significant and lead to partial or complete refractoriness to factor replacement, leading to increased risk for bleeding. Ideally, antibody titers should remain low. It is important to identify rising antibody titers as soon as possible. To reduce the impact of inhibitors, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page937" title="937"></span>inducing immune tolerance is critical. Immunosuppressive therapy in the form of corticosteroids, IVIG or cyclophosphamide may be used to remove inhibitors. Emicizumab is a new bispecific humanized monoclonal antibody that is effective in preventing bleeding in patients with hemophilia A. Initially indicated as effective therapy for patients with inhibitors, it is now also indicated for patients without inhibitors (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2132">Franchini, Marano, Pati, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2184">Young, Liesner, Chang, et al., 2019</a>). Patients with severe factor deficiency should be screened for antibodies, particularly prior to invasive procedures, so that appropriate therapy aimed at reducing risk for bleeding complications can be started. Other therapeutic options include administration of recombinant factor VIIa or activated prothrombin complex concentrates (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Reding, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Aminocaproic acid inhibits fibrinolysis and subsequently stabilizes blood clots. It can be very effective as an adjunctive measure to treat mucosal bleeding after oral surgery. Desmopressin induces a significant but short-lived increase in factor VIII levels; the mechanism of this response is unclear. In patients with mild forms of hemophilia A, desmopressin is very useful and can significantly reduce the requirement for blood products (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Mannucci, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1169">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most adult patients with hemophilia are diagnosed during childhood. They frequently need assistance in coping with the disease because it is chronic and imposes restrictions on their lifestyle. Additionally, the disease is inherited and can be passed to future generations. Helping patients cope with their condition, assisting them to identify positive aspects of their lives, and encouraging independence and self-sufficiency are important nursing activities. This must be balanced with promoting safety and preventing trauma that can result in acute bleeding. As patients mature, they can be encouraged to work through their feelings, progressing toward acceptance, and assuming greater responsibility for maintaining an optimal state of health.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with mild factor deficiency may not be diagnosed until they reach adulthood if they do not have surgery or significant trauma during childhood. The nurse must provide these patients with extensive education to understand activity restrictions and self-care strategies to reduce risk for hemorrhage and complications associated with bleeding. Safety at home and at work should be emphasized.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients and family caregivers need to learn how to administer factor concentrate at home at the earliest signs of bleeding to minimize bleeding and reduce complications. Prophylactic factor replacement can be beneficial in reducing morbidity associated with repeated episodes of bleeding. This method requires factor administration several times a week, making adherence to the regimen difficult. Nurses can help patients and families understand the potential benefits of prophylactic therapy while helping them to minimize the disadvantages. Patients with hemophilia are also instructed to avoid agents that can interfere with platelet aggregation that can add additional risk for bleeding. Aspirin, NSAIDs, some herbal and nutritional supplements (e.g., nettle, chamomile, alfalfa), and alcohol should be avoided. Oral hygiene is an important measure to reduce gingival bleeding, and good dental health should be promoted to reduce the need for extractions over the long term. While application of pressure may be helpful in controlling bleeding from minor injuries in patients with factor deficiency, it is inadequate in the presence of severe factor deficiency. Nasal packing for epistaxis should be avoided because bleeding often resumes when packing is removed. Splints and other orthopedic devices may be beneficial in supporting and immobilizing joints and muscles affected by hemorrhage. All injections should be avoided; invasive procedures (e.g., endoscopy, lumbar puncture) should be avoided or performed after administration of appropriate factor replacement. Patients with hemophilia should carry or wear medical identification (e.g., Medic-Alert bracelets). Additionally, patients and families should have a written emergency plan that includes measures to be taken in specific situations along with names and telephone numbers for emergency contacts.</p>
<p class="indent">During bleeding episodes, the extent of bleeding must be carefully assessed. Patients at risk for significant complications (e.g., bleeding into the respiratory tract or CNS) require close observation, specifically assessing for respiratory distress and altered levels of consciousness. Patients who have had recent surgery need careful monitoring to assess for bleeding from surgical sites. Frequent monitoring of vital signs, drains, and dressings is necessary to identify postoperative bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Significant pain requiring analgesics is often associated with hematomas and joint hemorrhage. Warm baths can be helpful in relieving pain, promoting relaxation, and improving mobility. During bleeding episodes, heat should be avoided because it may exacerbate bleeding; applications of cold are more efficacious.</p>
<p class="indent">Factor concentrates used since 1985 are free of viruses, including hepatitis C and HIV; however, patients treated prior to that time were exposed to these viruses (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Escobar &#x0026; Key, 2016</a>). Patients who have acquired HIV and other viral infections may need assistance in coping with these additional diagnoses and the consequences of infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Genetic testing and counseling should be offered to female carriers so they can make informed decisions regarding childbearing and managing pregnancy (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1170"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Advances in treatment have led to extended lifespans for patients with hemophilia, causing unique challenges for older patients with this disorder. Older adult patients with hemophilia are likely to have been managed with blood component transfusion and plasma-derived clotting factors prior to the advent of universal screening, at least early in life. For this reason, HIV and hepatitis B and C infections are not uncommon in this population; these infections carry significant risk for liver cancer and other liver diseases (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Mannucci, 2019</a>). Intracranial hemorrhage is the third most common cause of death after HIV and hepatitis and result from trauma. The likelihood of acquiring inhibitors increases with age.</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiovascular disease among adults with hemophilia can be difficult to manage. Antiplatelet therapy (including aspirin) can be challenging for patients with severe hemophilia. Stent placement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are accompanied by significant risk but aggressive factor replacement therapy can make these therapeutic treatments possible (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Kanellopoulou &#x0026; Nomikou, 2018</a>). Close collaboration and coordination of care with the patient&#x2019;s hematologist are required to improve outcomes.</p>

<p class="indent">Arthropathy is a major cause of morbidity in older patients with hemophilia and can result in reduced range of motion, impaired functioning, and chronic pain. However, quality of life can improve with arthroplasty and multidisciplinary rehabilitation tailored to address the special needs of older adults with hemophilia (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Mannucci, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1171">von Willebrand Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">vWD is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency in von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is necessary for factor VIII activation. The disease is characterized primarily by mucosa-associated bleeding and bleeding following surgery and trauma. vWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affecting up to 1% of the general population. It typically has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, affecting both genders equally (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Rick, 2019</a>). vWD is divided into types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 accounts for 70% to 80% of cases, and is characterized by a quantitative deficiency of vWF. Type 2, accounting for approximately 20% of cases, is caused by dysfunctional vWF. Type 2 is further subdivided on the basis of certain phenotypic characteristics. Type 3 vWD is rare and accounts for fewer than 5% of cases. It is the most severe form, and is caused by the absence of circulating vWF (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2151">Leebeek, &#x0026; Eikenboom, 2016</a>). <a href="#ff29-6">Figure 29-6</a> illustrates the differences in clotting found with hemophilia and vWD.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1172">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bleeding most often involves the mucous membranes. Nosebleeds, heavy menses, easy bruising, and prolonged bleeding from cuts and surgical sites are common. Soft tissue and joint hemorrhages are not seen often, unless the patient has type 3 vWD. As laboratory values fluctuate, so does bleeding. For example, postoperative bleeding may be minor with one procedure but significant with another (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Rick, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1173">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">vWD may be suspected based upon a personal or family history of bleeding that may then be confirmed by laboratory evidence of abnormalities in vWF, factor VIII, or both. The diagnosis of vWD is based on measurements of vWF antigen; the level of vWF&#x2013;dependent platelet adhesion, measured with the use of the vWF&#x2013;ristocetin cofactor activity assay; and the coagulant activity of factor VIII. Type 3 vWD is diagnosed when vWF antigen is undetectable (or the level is less than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page939" title="939"></span>5 IU/dL). These results are variable with individual patients over time, making it important to review laboratory values over time and not rely on single measurements (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Rick, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1174">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment is to replace the deficient protein (e.g., vWF or factor VIII) at the time of spontaneous bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure to prevent subsequent bleeding. Desmopressin is often used to prevent bleeding associated with dental and surgical procedures or to manage mild bleeding after surgery in patients with mild vWD; it is often not effective in treating those with type 3 vWD (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2151">Leebeek, &#x0026; Eikenboom, 2016</a>). Desmopressin provides a transient increase in factor VIII coagulant activity and may also correct bleeding time. Desmopressin can be given as an IV infusion or intranasally. IV administration is preferred for invasive procedures, including surgery. Hyponatremia and seizures may occur after repeated doses; therefore, treatment longer than 3 consecutive days is not typically indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Factor replacement concentrates of vWF and factor VIII are the treatments of choice for patients with type 3 vWD and most patients with type 2. The dosage and frequency of administration of these agents depend on the patient&#x2019;s factor VIII level and extent of bleeding. Treatment may be needed for up to 7 to 10 days after a surgical procedure and 3 to 4 days postpartum. In patients with type 3 vWD, prophylactic use of replacement agents is often successful in preventing or limiting spontaneous bleeding. Formation of antibodies to these agents is most likely to occur in patients with type 3 vWD receiving high doses.</p>
<p class="indent">Other agents are also effective in controlling bleeding. Aminocaproic acid is useful in managing mild mucosal bleeding because it inhibits dissolution of the thrombus at the site of bleeding. Topical agents that augment thrombin formation at the site of application help to achieve hemostasis in dental procedures. Estrogen-progesterone compounds may reduce bleeding associated with menses. Platelet transfusions are useful when there is significant bleeding. Cryoprecipitate, which is rich in vWF and factor VIII, typically is used only in emergencies due to risk for iatrogenic transmission of viruses. Herbs and medications that interfere with platelet function should be avoided (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Leebeek &#x0026; Eikenboom, 2016</a>).</p>
