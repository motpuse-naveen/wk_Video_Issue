<h4 class="h4" id="s1578">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">GI diagnostic studies can confirm, rule out, stage, or diagnose various disease states, including cancer. After the diagnosis, time should be allotted for discussion with the patient, in addition to offering resource materials for information.</p>
<p class="indent">Many modalities are available for diagnostic assessment of the GI tract. The majority of these tests and procedures are performed on an outpatient basis in special settings designed for this purpose (e.g., endoscopy suite or GI laboratory). Preparation for many of these studies includes either a clear liquid or low residue diet, fasting, ingestion of a liquid bowel preparation, the use of laxatives or enemas, and ingestion or injection of a contrast agent or a radiopaque dye. These measures are poorly tolerated by some patients and are especially problematic in older adults or patients with comorbidities because bowel preparations can significantly alter the internal fluid and electrolyte balance. If further assessment or treatment is needed after any outpatient procedure, the patient may be admitted to the hospital.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1216</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1217" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1217">p. 1217</span></div>
<p class="indent">Specific nursing interventions for each test are provided later in this chapter. General nursing interventions for the patient who is undergoing a GI diagnostic evaluation include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Establishing the need for more information</span></li>
<li><span>Providing education to patients and families on the diagnostic test, and pre- and postprocedure restrictions and care</span></li>
<li><span>Helping the patient cope with discomfort and alleviating anxiety</span></li>
<li><span>Informing the primary provider of known medical conditions or abnormal laboratory values that may affect the procedure</span></li>
<li><span>Assessing for adequate hydration before, during, and immediately after the procedure, and providing education about maintenance of hydration</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1579">Serum Laboratory Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Initial diagnostic tests begin with serum laboratory studies, including but not limited to CBC, complete metabolic panel, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, triglycerides, liver function tests, amylase, and lipase; possibly, more specific studies may be indicated, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, and alpha-fetoprotein, which are sensitive and specific for colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, respectively. CEA is a protein that is normally not detected in the blood of a healthy person; therefore, when detected it indicates that cancer is present, although not what type of cancer is present. CA 19-9 is also a protein that exists on the surface of certain cells and is shed by tumor cells, making it useful as a tumor marker to follow the course of the cancer. Tumor markers (e.g., mCEA and CA 19-9), along with other tests, are used in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer to demonstrate the effectiveness of treatment or to provide an early warning that the cancer has returned (<a href="#bib2831">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1580">Stool Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Basic examination of the stool includes inspecting the specimen for consistency, color, and occult (not visible) blood. Additional studies, including fecal urobilinogen, fecal fat, nitrogen, <em>Clostridium difficile,</em> fecal leukocytes, calculation of stool osmolar gap, parasites, pathogens, food residues, and other substances, require laboratory evaluation.</p>
<p class="indent">Stool samples are usually collected on a random basis unless a quantitative study (e.g., fecal fat, urobilinogen) is to be performed. Random specimens should be sent promptly to the laboratory for analysis; however, the quantitative 24- to 72-hour collections must be kept refrigerated until transported to the laboratory. Some stool collections require the patient to follow a specific diet or refrain from taking certain medications before the collection; patient education is important.</p>
<p class="indent">Guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) is one of the most commonly performed stool tests. It can be useful in initial screening for several disorders, although it is used most frequently in early cancer detection programs. gFOBT can be performed at the bedside, in the laboratory, or at home. It is inexpensive, noninvasive, and carries minimal risk to the patient. However, it should not be performed when there is hemorrhoidal bleeding. Patients are advised to avoid ingesting red meats, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 72 hours prior to the study because it is thought that these factors are associated with false-positive results; likewise, patients are advised to avoid ingesting vitamin C from supplements or foods as it is believed that this is associated with false-negative results (ACS, 2019). A small amount of the specimen is applied to the guaiac-impregnated paper slide. If the test is performed at home, the patient mails the slide to the primary provider or the lab in an envelope provided for that purpose. The ACS (2019) recommends using the highly sensitive versions of this type of test (e.g., fecal immunochemical test [FIT], FIT-fecal DNA test) for screening.</p>
<p class="indent">The FIT reacts to the human hemoglobin protein. The stool sample can be obtained at home, and dietary or medication restrictions are not required prior to collecting the stool specimen. This test is less likely to react to bleeding from other areas of the digestive tract and is done annually (ACS, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">FIT-fecal DNA testing can detect abnormal sections of DNA from cancer or polyp cells (ACS, 2019). The Centers for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Services approved this test for reimbursement and recommends performing the test every 3 years (<a href="#bib2846">Rex, Boland, Dominitz, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The FIT-fecal DNA test does not require any dietary or medication restrictions and can detect neoplasia anywhere in the colon.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1581">Breath Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The hydrogen breath test was developed to evaluate carbohydrate absorption, in addition to aiding in the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth in the intestine and short-bowel syndrome. This test determines the amount of hydrogen expelled in the breath after it has been produced in the colon (on contact of galactose with fermenting bacteria) and absorbed into the blood.</p>
<p class="indent">Urea breath tests detect the presence of <em>Helicobacter pylori,</em> the bacteria that can live in the mucosal lining of the stomach and cause peptic ulcer disease. After the patient ingests a capsule of carbon-labeled urea, a breath sample is obtained 10 to 20 minutes later. Because <em>H. pylori</em> metabolizes urea rapidly, the labeled carbon is absorbed quickly; it can then be measured as carbon dioxide in the expired breath to determine whether <em>H. pylori</em> is present. Prior to urea breath testing, the patient is instructed to avoid antibiotics or bismuth subsalicylate for 1 month before the test; proton pump inhibitors for 2 weeks before the test; and cimetidine and famotidine for 24 hours before the test (HealthLinkBC, 2018). <em>H. pylori</em> also can be detected by assessing serum antibody levels without requiring medication therapy adjustments.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1582">Abdominal Ultrasonography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ultrasonography is a noninvasive diagnostic technique in which high-frequency sound waves are passed into internal body structures, and the ultrasonic echoes are recorded on an oscilloscope as they strike tissues of different densities. It is particularly useful in the detection of an enlarged gallbladder or pancreas, the presence of gallstones, an enlarged ovary, an ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis. Ultrasonography can be limited by patient body type, bowel gas patterns, and operator experience (<a href="#bib2858">Babakhanlou, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1217</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1218" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1218">p. 1218</span></div>
<p class="indent">Advantages of abdominal ultrasonography include an absence of ionizing radiation, no noticeable side effects, relatively low cost, and almost immediate results. It cannot be used to examine structures that lie behind bony tissue, because bone prevents sound waves from traveling into deeper structures. Gas and fluid in the abdomen or air in the lungs also prevent transmission of ultrasound. An ultrasound produces no ill effects. However, some patients, such as pregnant women, have concerns regarding the energy emitted by the probe.</p>
<p class="indent">Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a specialized enteroscopic procedure that aids in the diagnosis of GI disorders by providing direct imaging of a target area. A small high-frequency ultrasonic transducer is mounted at the tip of the fiberoptic scope, which displays images that are of higher-quality resolution and definition than regular ultrasound imaging. EUS may be used to evaluate submucosal lesions, specifically their location and depth of penetration. In addition, EUS may aid in the evaluation of Barrett esophagus, portal hypertension, chronic pancreatitis, suspected pancreatic neoplasm, biliary tract disease, and changes in the bowel wall due to ulcerative colitis. Intestinal gas, bone, and thick layers of adipose tissue that hamper conventional ultrasonography are not problems when EUS is used.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is instructed to fast for 8 to 12 hours before ultrasound testing to decrease the amount of gas in the bowel. If gallbladder studies are being performed, the patient should eat a fat-free meal the evening before the test. If barium studies are to be performed, they should be scheduled after ultrasonography; otherwise, the barium could interfere with the transmission of the sound waves. Patients who receive moderate sedation are observed for about 1 hour to assess for level of consciousness, orientation, and ability to ambulate. Patients treated on an outpatient basis are given instructions regarding diet, activity, and how to monitor for complications (<a href="#bib2843">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1583">Genetic Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Researchers have refined methods for genetics risk assessment, preclinical diagnosis, and prenatal diagnosis to identify people who are at risk for certain GI disorders (e.g., gastric cancer, lactose deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer) (<a href="#ct38-3">Chart 38-3</a>). People who are identified as being at risk for certain GI disorders may choose to have genetic counseling to learn about the disease and options for preventing and treating the disease, and to receive support in coping <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1219" title="1219"></span>with the situation. Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is associated with colonic and extracolonic cancers; 3% of new cases of colon cancer are attributed to Lynch syndrome (<a href="#bib2858">Kohlmann &#x0026; Gruber, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib2858">Sinicrope, 2018</a>). See <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for further discussion of genetic counseling.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1584">Imaging Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Numerous minimally invasive and noninvasive imaging studies, including x-ray and contrast studies, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, scintigraphy (radionuclide imaging), and virtual colonoscopy are available today.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Study</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An upper GI fluoroscopy delineates the entire GI tract after the introduction of a contrast agent. A radiopaque liquid (e.g., barium sulfate) is commonly used; however, thin barium, diatrizoate sodium (Hypaque), and at times water are used due to their low associated risks. The GI series enables the examiner to detect or exclude anatomic or functional disorders of the upper GI organs or sphincters. It also aids in the diagnosis of ulcers, varices, tumors, regional enteritis, and malabsorption syndromes. The procedure may be extended to examine the duodenum and small bowel (small-bowel follow-through). As the barium descends into the stomach, the position, patency, and caliber of the esophagus are visualized, enabling the examiner to detect or exclude any anatomic or functional derangement of that organ. Fluoroscopic examination next extends to the stomach as its lumen fills with barium, allowing observation of stomach motility, thickness of the gastric wall, the mucosal pattern, patency of the pyloric valve, and the anatomy of the duodenum. Multiple x-ray images are obtained during the procedure, and additional images may be taken at intervals for up to 24 hours to evaluate the rate of gastric emptying. Small-bowel x-rays taken while the barium is passing through that area allow for observation of the motility of the small bowel. Obstructions, ileitis, and diverticula can also be detected.</p>
<p class="indent">Variations of the upper GI study include double-contrast studies and enteroclysis. The double-contrast method of examining the upper GI tract involves administration of a thick barium suspension to outline the stomach and esophageal wall, after which tablets that release carbon dioxide in the presence of water are given. This technique has the advantage of showing the esophagus and stomach in finer detail, permitting signs of early superficial neoplasms to be noted.</p>
<p class="indent">Enteroclysis is a very detailed, double-contrast study of the entire small intestine that involves the continuous infusion (through a duodenal tube) of 500 to 1000 mL of a thin barium sulfate suspension; after this, methylcellulose is infused through the tube. The barium and methylcellulose fill the intestinal loops and are observed continuously by fluoroscopy and viewed at frequent intervals as they progress through the jejunum and the ileum. Air may also be used, but methylcellulose is preferred as it is associated with enhanced visibility (<a href="#bib2858">Lampignano &#x0026; Kendrick, 2018</a>). This process (even with normal motility) can take up to 6 hours and can be quite uncomfortable for the patient. The procedure aids in the diagnosis of partial small-bowel obstructions or diverticula. After completion of the fluoroscopic component of the study, the patient may have a CT scan to assess for lesions or adhesions, and in this case an iodinated contrast media may be used (<a href="#bib2858">Lampignano &#x0026; Kendrick, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Instruction regarding dietary changes prior to the study may include a low residue or clear liquid diet, and nothing by mouth (<em>nil per os;</em> NPO) after midnight the night before the study. In addition, the patient is advised to not smoke or chew gum during the NPO period because these can increase gastric secretions and salivation (<a href="#bib2858">Lampignano &#x0026; Kendrick, 2018</a>). Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based solutions are considered the most effective bowel cleansing preparatory agent; other agents include sodium phosphate, magnesium citrate, and preparations containing sodium picosulfate, citric acid, and magnesium oxide (<a href="#bib2858">Harrison &#x0026; Hielkrem, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib2850">Tan, Lin, Ma, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Typically, oral medications are withheld on the morning of the study and resumed that evening, but each patient&#x2019;s medication regimen should be evaluated on an individual basis. When a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes is NPO, their insulin requirements will need to be adjusted accordingly (see <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Follow-up care is provided after the upper GI procedure to ensure that the patient has eliminated most of the ingested barium. Fluids may be increased to facilitate evacuation of stool and barium.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Study</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Visualization of the lower GI tract is obtained after rectal installation of barium. The barium enema can be used to detect the presence of polyps, tumors, or other lesions of the large intestine and demonstrate any anatomic abnormalities or malfunctioning of the bowel. After proper preparation and evacuation of the entire colon, each portion of the colon may be readily observed. The procedure usually takes about 15 to 30 minutes, during which time x-ray images are obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Other means for visualizing the colon include double-contrast studies and a water-soluble contrast study. These tests are still occasionally used because they are relatively inexpensive and simple. A double-contrast or air-contrast barium enema involves the instillation of a thicker barium solution, followed by the instillation of air. The patient may feel some cramping or discomfort during this process. This test provides a contrast between the air-filled lumen and the barium-coated mucosa, allowing easier detection of smaller lesions. CT colonography has replaced double-contrast barium enema for nearly all indicated GI disorders (<a href="#bib2846">Rex et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">If active inflammatory disease, fistulas, or perforation of the colon is suspected, a water-soluble iodinated contrast agent (e.g., diatrizoic acid [Gastrografin]) can be used. The procedure is the same as for a barium enema, but the patient must first be assessed for allergy to iodine or contrast agent. The contrast agent is eliminated readily after the procedure, so there is no need for postprocedure laxatives. Diarrhea may occur in some patients until the contrast agent has been totally eliminated.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1219</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1220" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1220">p. 1220</span></div>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preparation of the patient includes emptying and cleansing the lower bowel. This often necessitates a low residue diet 1 to 2 days before the test, a clear liquid diet and a laxative the evening before, NPO after midnight, and cleansing enemas until returns are clear the following morning. The nurse makes sure that barium enemas are scheduled before any upper GI studies. If the patient has active inflammatory disease of the colon, enemas are contraindicated. Barium enemas also are contraindicated in patients with signs of perforation or obstruction; instead, a water-soluble contrast study may be performed. Active GI bleeding may prohibit the use of laxatives and enemas.</p>
<p class="indent">Postprocedural patient education includes information about increasing fluid intake, evaluating bowel movements for evacuation of barium, and noting increased number of bowel movements, because barium, due to its high osmolarity, may draw fluid into the bowel, thus increasing the intraluminal contents and resulting in greater output.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Computed Tomography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A CT scan provides cross-sectional images of abdominal organs and structures. Multiple x-ray images are taken from numerous angles, digitized in a computer, reconstructed, and then viewed on a computer monitor. As the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans have increased in recent years, so has their use. Volume CT scanners (i.e., helical or spiral scanning) provide more accurate reconstruction of patient data into alternate planes, require shorter scan times, and have less artifact when compared to single slice scanning (<a href="#bib2858">Lampignano &#x0026; Kendrick, 2018</a>). CT is a valuable tool for detecting and localizing many inflammatory conditions in the colon, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis, as well as evaluating the abdomen for diseases of the liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, and pelvic organs, and structural abnormalities of the abdominal wall. The CT procedure is completely painless, but radiation doses are considerable. A CT scan may be performed with or without oral or intravenous (IV) contrast, but the enhancement of the study is greater with the use of a contrast agent. In patients at risk for complications from use of contrast, the radiologist and provider must be in agreement that the scan is medically necessary and that the benefits outweigh the risks (<a href="#bib2854">Yale School of Medicine, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Common risks from IV contrast agents include allergic reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN); therefore, patients must be screened for these risks (<a href="#bib2837">Hossain, Costanzo, Cosentino, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Any allergies to contrast agents, iodine, or shellfish, the patient&#x2019;s current serum creatinine level, and pregnancy status in females must be determined before administration of a contrast agent. Patients allergic to the contrast agent may be premedicated with a corticosteroid and antihistamine.</p>
<p class="indent">The most effective ways to prevent CIN include careful selection of patients, maintaining hydration status, using newer contrast agents, and avoiding nephrotoxic agents pre- and postprocedure (<a href="#bib2837">Hossain et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h6>
<p class="nonindent">MRI is used in gastroenterology to supplement ultrasonography and CT. This noninvasive technique uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the area being studied. The use of oral contrast agents to enhance the image has increased the application of this technique for the diagnosis of GI diseases. It is useful in evaluating abdominal soft tissues as well as blood vessels, abscesses, fistulas, neoplasms, and other sources of bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">The physiologic artifacts of heartbeat, respiration, and peristalsis may create a less-than-clear image; however, newer, fast-imaging MRI techniques help eliminate these physiologic motion artifacts. MRI is not totally safe for all people; having the patient complete a preprocedure MRI tool that screens for contraindications to MRI is required (<a href="#bib2858">Lampignano &#x0026; Kendrick, 2018</a>). Any ferromagnetic objects (metals that contain iron) can be attracted to the magnet and cause injury. Items that can be problematic or dangerous include jewelry, dental implants, paper clips, pens, keys, IV poles, clips on patient gowns, and oxygen tanks.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>MRI is contraindicated in patients with any device containing metal because the magnetic field could cause malfunction. MRI is also contraindicated for patients with internal metal devices (e.g., aneurysm clips), intraocular metallic fragments, or cochlear implants. Foil-backed skin patches (e.g., nicotine, nitroglycerin, scopolamine, clonidine) should be removed before an MRI because of the risk of burns; however, the patient&#x2019;s primary provider should be consulted before the patch is removed to determine whether an alternate form of the medication should be provided.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preprocedure patient education includes NPO status 6 to 8 hours before the study and removal of all jewelry and other metals. The patient and family are informed that the study may take 60 to 90 minutes; during this time, the technician will instruct the patient to take deep breaths at specific intervals. The close-fitting scanners used in many MRI facilities may induce feelings of claustrophobia, and the machine will make a knocking sound during the procedure. Patients may choose to wear a headset and listen to music or wear a blindfold during the procedure. Open MRIs that are less close fitting eliminate the claustrophobia that many patients experience; however, they produce lower-resolution images.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Positron Emission Tomography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">PET scans produce images of the body by detecting the radiation emitted from radioactive substances. The radioactive substances are injected into the body IV and are usually tagged with radioactive isotopes of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, or fluorine (<a href="#bib2858">Lampignano &#x0026; Kendrick, 2018</a>). These isotopes decay quickly, do not harm the body, have lower radiation levels than a typical x-ray or CT scan, and are eliminated in the urine or feces. The scanner essentially &#x201C;captures&#x201D; where <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1221" title="1221"></span>the radioactive substances are in the body, transmits information to a scanner, and produces a scan with &#x201C;hot spots&#x201D; for evaluation by the radiologist or oncologist.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Scintigraphy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Scintigraphy (radionuclide testing) relies on the use of radioactive isotopes (i.e., technetium, iodine, indium) to reveal displaced anatomic structures, changes in organ size, and the presence of neoplasms or other focal lesions such as cysts or abscesses. Scintigraphic scanning is also used to measure the uptake of tagged red blood cells and leukocytes. Tagging of red blood cells and leukocytes by injection of a radionuclide is performed to define areas of inflammation, abscess, blood loss, or neoplasm. A sample of blood is removed, mixed with a radioactive substance, and reinjected into the patient. Abnormal concentrations of blood cells are then detected at 24- and 48-hour intervals. Tagged red cell studies are useful in determining the source of internal bleeding when all other studies have returned a negative result.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal Motility Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radionuclide testing also is used to assess gastric emptying and colonic transit time. During gastric emptying studies, the liquid and solid components of a meal (typically scrambled eggs) are tagged with radionuclide markers. After ingestion of the meal, the patient is positioned under a scintiscanner, which measures the rate of passage of the radioactive substance from the stomach (<a href="#bib2858">Parkman, 2018</a>). This is useful in diagnosing disorders of gastric motility, diabetic gastroparesis, and dumping syndrome.</p>
<p class="indent">Colonic transit studies are used to evaluate colonic motility and obstructive defecation syndromes. The patient is given a capsule containing 20 radionuclide markers and instructed to follow a regular diet and usual daily activities. Abdominal x-rays are taken every 24 hours until all markers are passed. This process usually takes 4 to 5 days; in the presence of severe constipation it may take as long as 10 days. Patients with chronic diarrhea may be evaluated at 8-hour intervals. The amount of time that it takes for the radioactive material to move through the colon indicates colonic motility.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1585">Endoscopic Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Endoscopic procedures used in GI tract assessment include fibroscopy/esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, anoscopy, proctoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, small-bowel enteroscopy, and endoscopy through an ostomy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Upper Gastrointestinal Fibroscopy/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fibroscopy of the upper GI tract allows direct visualization of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa through a lighted endoscope (gastroscope) (<a href="#ff38-5">Fig. 38-5</a>). EGD is valuable when esophageal, gastric, or duodenal disorders or inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious processes are suspected. This procedure also can be used to evaluate esophageal and gastric motility and to collect secretions and tissue specimens for further analysis.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff38-5">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff38-5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff38-5.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;38-5 &#x2022;</span> Patient undergoing gastroscopy.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">In EGD, the gastroenterologist views the GI tract through a viewing lens and can obtain images through the scope to document findings. Electronic video endoscopes also are available that attach directly to a video processor, converting the electronic signals into pictures that are projected on a screen. This allows larger and continuous viewing capabilities, as well as the simultaneous recording of the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">PillCam ESO, or capsule endoscopy, requires that the patient swallows a capsule that travels by peristalsis through the small intestines. The capsule contains an oxide metal silicon chip video camera, which transmits digital images of the GI mucosa to a data recorder that is worn on the patient&#x2019;s waist. This technology is a diagnostic option for patients with esophageal diseases who cannot tolerate an EGD (<a href="#bib2858">Park, Cho, &#x0026; Kim, 2018</a>). Capsule colonoscopy is FDA approved for patients with previous incomplete colonoscopies, and for those who are not candidates for colonoscopies or sedation (<a href="#bib2846">Rex et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) uses the endoscope in combination with x-rays to view the bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, and gallbladder (<a href="#bib2858">MedlinePlus, 2019</a>). The side-viewing flexible scopes are used to visualize the common bile duct and the pancreatic and hepatic ducts through the ampulla of Vater in the duodenum. ERCP is helpful in evaluating jaundice, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumors, common bile duct stones, and biliary tract disease. Current trends show an increase in ERCP use for therapeutic indications (sphincterotomy, stone removal, and biliary stenting), with a decline in its use for conventional diagnostic testing (<a href="#bib2830">Ahmed, Kanotra, Savani, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). ERCP is described further in <a href="c44.xhtml">Chapter 44</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Upper GI fibroscopy also can be a therapeutic procedure when combined with other procedures. Therapeutic endoscopy can be used to remove common bile duct stones, dilate strictures, and treat gastric bleeding and esophageal varices. Laser-compatible scopes can be used to provide laser therapy for upper GI neoplasms. Sclerosing solutions can be injected through the scope in an attempt to control upper GI bleeding.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1221</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1222" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1222">p. 1222</span></div>
<p class="indent">After the patient is sedated, the endoscope is lubricated with a water-soluble lubricant and passed smoothly and slowly along the back of the mouth and down into the esophagus. The gastroenterologist views the gastric wall and the sphincters and then advances the endoscope into the duodenum for further examination. Biopsy forceps to obtain tissue specimens or cytology brushes to obtain cells for microscopic study can be passed through the scope. The procedure usually takes about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may experience nausea, gagging, or choking. The use of topical anesthetic agents and moderate sedation makes it important to monitor and maintain the patient&#x2019;s oral airway during and after the procedure. Finger or ear oximeters are used to monitor oxygen saturation, and supplemental oxygen may be given if needed. Precautions must be taken to protect the scope, because the fiberoptic bundles can be broken if the scope is bent at an acute angle. The patient wears a mouth guard to keep from biting the scope.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient should be NPO for 8 hours prior to the examination. Before the introduction of the endoscope, the patient is given a local anesthetic gargle or spray. Midazolam, a sedative that provides moderate sedation with loss of the gag reflex and relieves anxiety during the procedure, is given. Atropine may be given to reduce secretions, and glucagon may be given to relax smooth muscle. The patient is positioned in the left lateral position to facilitate clearance of pulmonary secretions and provide smooth entry of the scope.</p>
<p class="indent">After gastroscopy, assessment includes level of consciousness, vital signs, oxygen saturation, pain level, and monitoring for signs of perforation (i.e., pain, bleeding, unusual difficulty swallowing, rapidly elevated temperature). Temporary loss of the gag reflex is expected; after the patient&#x2019;s gag reflex has returned, lozenges, saline gargle, and oral analgesic agents may be offered to relieve minor throat discomfort. Patients who were sedated for the procedure must remain in bed until fully alert. After moderate sedation, the patient must be transported home with a family member or friend if the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Someone should stay with the patient until the morning after the procedure. Because of sedation, many patients will not remember postprocedure instructions. For this reason, discharge and follow-up verbal and written instructions are provided to the person accompanying the patient home, as well as to the patient. In addition, many endoscopy suites have a program in which a nurse telephones the patient the morning after the procedure to find out if the patient has any concerns or questions related to the procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fiberoptic Colonoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Historically, direct visualization of the bowel was the only means to evaluate the colon, but virtual colonoscopy (also known as CT colonography) is now available. Advantages include less risk for perforation when compared to colonoscopy; however, the need for bowel preparation is considered a disadvantage (<a href="#bib2846">Rex et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Direct visual inspection of the large intestine (anus, rectum, sigmoid, transcending and ascending colon) is possible by means of a flexible fiberoptic colonoscope (<a href="#ff38-6">Fig. 38-6</a>). These scopes have the same capabilities as those used for EGD but are larger in diameter and longer. Still and video recordings can be used to document the procedure and findings.</p>
<p class="indent">This procedure is used commonly as a diagnostic aid and screening device. It is most frequently used for cancer screening and for surveillance in patients with previous colon cancer or polyps. (See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec04.xhtml#tt12-3">Table 12-3</a> for details on the ACS&#x2019;s screening guidelines.) In addition, tissue biopsies can be obtained as needed, and polyps can be removed and evaluated. Other uses of colonoscopy include the evaluation of patients with diarrhea of unknown cause, occult bleeding, or anemia; further study of abnormalities detected on barium enema; and diagnosis, clarification, and determination of the extent of inflammatory or other bowel disease.</p>
<p class="indent">The procedure can be used to remove all visible polyps with a special snare and cautery through the colonoscope. Many colon cancers begin with adenomatous polyps of the colon; therefore, one goal of colonoscopic polypectomy is early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. This procedure also can be used to treat areas of bleeding or stricture. The use of bipolar and unipolar coagulators and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1223" title="1223"></span>heater probes, as well as injections of sclerosing agents or vasoconstrictors, is possible during this procedure. Laser-compatible scopes provide laser therapy for bleeding lesions or colonic neoplasms. Bowel decompression (removal of intestinal contents to prevent gas and fluid from distending the coils of the intestine) can also be completed during the procedure.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff38-6">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff38-6.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff38-6.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;38-6 &#x2022;</span> Colonoscopy and flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy. For the colonoscopy, the flexible scope is passed through the rectum and sigmoid colon into the descending, transverse, and ascending colon. For the flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy, the flexible scope is advanced past the proximal sigmoid and then into the descending colon.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Colonoscopy is performed while the patient is lying on the left side with the legs drawn up toward the chest. The patient&#x2019;s position may be changed during the test to facilitate advancement of the scope. Biopsy forceps or a cytology brush may be passed through the scope to obtain specimens for histology and cytology examinations. Complications during and after the procedure can include cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory depression resulting from the medications given, vasovagal reactions, and circulatory overload or hypotension resulting from overhydration or underhydration during bowel preparation. The patient&#x2019;s cardiac and respiratory function and oxygen saturation are monitored continuously, with supplemental oxygen used as necessary. Typically, the procedure takes about 1 hour, and postprocedure discomfort results from instillation of air to expand the colon and insertion and movement of the scope during the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Capsule colonoscopy is another option for patients who cannot tolerate colonoscopy or for patients with incomplete colonoscopies. This minimally invasive test consists of an ingestible capsule with a two-sided camera (similar to the PillCam ESO). This test requires that the patient completes a more extensive bowel preparation than required for a colonoscopy; patients with a positive test then require a follow-up colonoscopy on a separate day (<a href="#bib2846">Rex et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The success of colonoscopy depends on how well the colon is prepared (<a href="#bib2851">Tariq, Kamal, Sapkota, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Adequate colon cleansing provides optimal visualization and decreases the time needed for the procedure. Cleansing of the colon can be accomplished in various ways. The primary provider may prescribe a laxative for two nights before the examination and a Fleet or saline enema until the return is clear the morning of the test. However, more commonly, PEG electrolyte lavage solutions (GoLYTELY, CoLyte, and NuLYTELY) are used for effective cleansing of the bowel. Current preparations include either the nonsplit dose regimen, in which the entire solution is ingested the night before the procedure, or the split-dose regimen, in which half of the dose is ingested the night before and half is ingested the morning of the procedure, 3 hours prior to the scheduled test. Tariq et&#x00A0;al. (2019) report improved bowel preparation and cleansing with the split prep.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient health history and comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic constipation, or history of opioid use, or problematic colonoscopies influence patient preparation. Preprocedure diet instructions include a clear liquid or a low residue diet starting the day before the procedure; diet type has not been shown to affect bowel preparation in patients ingesting the split preparations (<a href="#bib2851">Tariq et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If necessary, the nurse can give the solution through a feeding tube if the patient cannot swallow. Patients with a colostomy can receive this same bowel preparation. The use of lavage solutions is contraindicated in patients with intestinal obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<p class="indent">A sodium phosphate tablet (OsmoPrep, Visicol) can be used for colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy. Dosing consists of 32 tablets: 20 tablets (4 tablets every 15 minutes) with 8 oz of any clear liquid (water, any clear carbonated beverage, or juice) on the evening prior to the examination, and 12 tablets (taken in the same manner) on the morning of the examination.</p>
<p class="indent">With the use of lavage solutions, bowel cleansing is fast (rectal effluent is clear in about 4 hours) and is tolerated fairly well by most patients. Side effects of the electrolyte solutions include nausea, bloating, cramps or abdominal fullness, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and hypothermia (patients are often told to drink the preparation as cold as possible to make it more palatable). The side effects are especially problematic for older adults, and sometimes they have difficulty ingesting the required volume of solution. Monitoring older patients after a bowel preparation is especially important because their physiologic ability to compensate for fluid loss is diminished. Many older adults take multiple medications each day; therefore, the nurse&#x2019;s knowledge of their daily medication regimen can prompt assessment for and prevention of potential problems and early detection of physiologic changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, the nurse advises the patient with diabetes to consult with their primary provider about medication adjustment to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia resulting from the dietary modifications required in preparing for the test. The nurse also instructs all patients, especially older adults, to maintain adequate fluid, electrolyte, and caloric intake while undergoing bowel cleansing.</p>
<p class="indent">Special precautions must be taken for some patients. Implantable defibrillators and pacemakers are at high risk for malfunction if electrosurgical procedures (i.e., polypectomy) are performed in conjunction with colonoscopy. A cardiologist should be consulted before the test is performed for device management. These patients require careful cardiac monitoring during the procedure (<a href="#bib2833">American Society of Anesthesiology Taskforce, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib2844">Neubauer, Wellman, Herzog-Niescery, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Colonoscopy cannot be performed if there is a suspected or documented colon perforation, acute severe diverticulitis, or acute colitis. Patients with prosthetic heart valves or a history of endocarditis require prophylactic antibiotics before the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Informed consent is obtained by the practitioner before the patient is sedated. Before the examination, an opioid analgesic agent or sedative (e.g., midazolam) is given to provide moderate sedation and relieve anxiety during the procedure. Glucagon may be given, if needed, to relax the colonic musculature and to reduce spasm during the test. Patients who are older or debilitated may require a reduced dosage of the analgesic agent or sedative to decrease the risks of oversedation and cardiopulmonary complications.</p>
<p class="indent">During the procedure, the patient is monitored for changes in oxygen saturation, vital signs, color and temperature of the skin, level of consciousness, abdominal distention, vagal response, and pain intensity. After the procedure, patients are maintained on bed rest until fully alert. Some patients have abdominal cramps caused by increased <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1224" title="1224"></span>peristalsis stimulated by the air insufflated into the bowel during the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately after the test, the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of bowel perforation (e.g., rectal bleeding, abdominal pain or distention, fever, focal peritoneal signs). Because of the amnesic effects of midazolam, the patient may be unable to recall verbal information and should receive written instructions. If the procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, someone must transport the patient home. After a therapeutic procedure, the nurse instructs the patient to report any bleeding to the primary provider.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Anoscopy, Proctoscopy, and Sigmoidoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Endoscopic examination of the anus, rectum, and sigmoid and descending colon is used to evaluate chronic diarrhea, fecal incontinence, ischemic colitis, and lower GI hemorrhage and to observe for ulceration, fissures, abscesses, tumors, polyps, or other pathologic processes.</p>
<p class="indent">The flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscope (see <a href="#ff38-6">Fig. 38-6</a>) permits the colon to be examined up to 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 inches) from the anus, much more than the 25 cm (10 inches) that can be visualized with the rigid sigmoidoscope. It has many of the same capabilities as the scopes used for the upper GI study, including the use of still or video images to document findings.</p>
<p class="indent">For flexible scope procedures, the patient assumes a comfortable position on the left side with the right leg bent and placed anteriorly. It is important to keep the patient informed throughout the examination and to explain the sensations associated with it. Biopsies and polypectomies can be performed during this procedure. Biopsy is performed with small biting forceps introduced through the endoscope; one or more small pieces of tissue may be removed. If polyps are present, they may be removed with a wire snare, which is used to grasp the pedicle, or stalk. An electrocoagulating current is then used to sever the polyp and prevent bleeding. It is extremely important that all excised tissue be placed immediately in moist gauze or in an appropriate receptacle, labeled correctly, and delivered without delay to the pathology laboratory for examination.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">These examinations require only limited bowel preparation, including a warm tap water or Fleet enema until returns are clear. Dietary restrictions usually are not necessary, and sedation usually is not required. During the procedure, the nurse monitors vital signs, skin color and temperature, pain tolerance, and vagal response. After the procedure, the nurse monitors the patient for rectal bleeding and signs of intestinal perforation (i.e., fever, rectal drainage, abdominal distention, pain). On completion of the examination, the patient can resume regular activities and diet.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Small Bowel Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several methods are available for visualization of the small intestine, including capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy. Capsule endoscopy allows the noninvasive visualization of the mucosa throughout the entire small intestine. It is particularly useful in the evaluation of obscure GI bleeding. The technique consists of the patient swallowing a capsule embedded with a wireless miniature camera, a light source, and an image transmission system. The capsule is the size of a large vitamin pill. It is propelled through the intestine by peristalsis. Images are transmitted from the end of the capsule to a recording device worn by the patient. The capsule allows for inspection of the small intestine without patient discomfort (<a href="#bib2858">Yamamoto &#x0026; Aabakken, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Double-balloon enteroscopy has made it possible to visualize the mucosa of the entire small bowel as well as carry out diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (<a href="#bib2858">Yamamoto &#x0026; Aabakken, 2019</a>). This endoscope is comprised of two balloons, one attached to the distal end of the scope and the other attached to the transparent overtube that slides over the endoscope. The endoscope is advanced alternately inflating and deflating the balloons; this causes telescoping of the small intestine onto the overtube. As a result of this telescoping, the endoscope can visualize much more of the small intestine than the length of the scope itself. The procedure takes between 1 and 3 hours and requires moderate sedation. Nursing interventions are similar to those for other endoscopic procedures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endoscopy through an Ostomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Endoscopy through an ostomy stoma is useful for visualizing a segment of the small or large intestine and may be indicated to evaluate the anastomosis for recurrent disease, or to visualize and treat bleeding in a segment of the bowel. Nursing interventions are similar to those for other endoscopic procedures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1586">Manometry and Electrophysiologic Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Manometry and electrophysiologic studies are methods for evaluating patients with GI motility disorders. The manometry test measures changes in intraluminal pressures and the coordination of muscle activity in the GI tract with the pressures transmitted to a computer analyzer.</p>
<p class="indent">Esophageal manometry is used to detect motility disorders of the esophagus and the upper and lower esophageal sphincter. Also known as esophageal motility studies, these studies are very helpful in the diagnosis of achalasia (i.e., absence of peristalsis), diffuse esophageal spasm, scleroderma, and other esophageal motor disorders. The patient must refrain from eating or drinking for 8 to 12 hours before the test. Medications that could have a direct effect on motility (e.g., calcium channel blockers, anticholinergic agents, sedatives) are withheld for 24 to 48 hours. A pressure-sensitive catheter is inserted through the nose and is connected to a transducer and a video recorder. The patient then swallows small amounts of water while the resultant pressure changes are recorded. Evaluation of a patient for GERD typically includes esophageal manometry.</p>
<p class="indent">Gastroduodenal, small intestine, and colonic manometry procedures are used to evaluate delayed gastric emptying and gastric and intestinal motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or atonic colon. This is often an ambulatory outpatient procedure lasting 24 to 72 hours. Anorectal manometry measures the resting tone of the internal anal sphincter and the contractibility of the external anal sphincter. It is helpful in evaluating patients with chronic constipation or fecal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1225" title="1225"></span>incontinence and is useful in biofeedback for the treatment of fecal incontinence. It can be performed in conjunction with rectal sensory functioning tests. Dibasic sodium (Phospho-soda) or a saline cleansing enema is given 1 hour before the test, and positioning for the test is either the prone or the lateral position.</p>
<p class="indent">Rectal sensory function studies are used to evaluate rectal sensory function and neuropathy. A catheter and balloon are passed into the rectum, with increasing balloon inflation until the patient feels distention. Then the tone and pressure of the rectum and anal sphincter are measured. The results are especially helpful in the evaluation of patients with chronic constipation, diarrhea, or incontinence.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrogastrography, an electrophysiologic study, also may be performed to assess gastric motility disturbances and can be useful in detecting motor or nerve dysfunction in the stomach. Electrodes are placed over the abdomen, and gastric electrical activity is recorded for up to 24 hours. Patients may exhibit rapid, slow, or irregular waveform activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Defecography measures anorectal function and is performed with very thick barium paste instilled into the rectum. Fluoroscopy is used to assess the function of the rectum and anal sphincter while the patient attempts to expel the barium. The test requires no preparation. The nurse educates the patient about what to expect during these procedures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1587">Gastric Analysis, Gastric Acid Stimulation Test, and pH Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Analysis of the gastric juice yields information about the secretory activity of the gastric mucosa and the presence or degree of gastric retention in patients thought to have pyloric or duodenal obstruction. It is also useful for diagnosing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or atrophic gastritis.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is NPO for 8 to 12 hours before the procedure. Any medications that affect gastric secretions are withheld for 24 to 48 hours before the test. Smoking is not allowed on the morning of the test because it increases gastric secretions. A small nasogastric tube with a catheter tip marked at various points is inserted through the nose. When the tube is at a point slightly less than 50 cm (21 inches), it should be within the stomach, lying along the greater curvature. Once in place, the tube is secured to the patient&#x2019;s cheek and the patient is placed in a semireclining position. The entire stomach contents are aspirated by gentle suction into a syringe, and gastric samples are collected every 15 minutes for the next hour.</p>
<p class="indent">Important diagnostic information to be gained from gastric analysis includes the ability of the mucosa to secrete HCl. This ability is altered in various disease states, including:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Pernicious anemia:</em> Patients with this disease secrete no acid under basal conditions or after stimulation.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Severe chronic atrophic gastritis or gastric cancer:</em> Patients with these diseases secrete little or no acid.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Gastric ulcer:</em> Patients with this disease secrete some acid.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Duodenal ulcers:</em> Patients with this disease usually secrete an excess amount of acid.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The gastric acid stimulation test usually is performed in conjunction with gastric analysis. Histamine or pentagastrin is given subcutaneously to stimulate gastric secretions. It is important to inform the patient that this injection may produce a flushed feeling. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure and pulse frequently to detect hypotension. Gastric specimens are collected after the injection every 15 minutes for 1 hour and are labeled to indicate the time of specimen collection after histamine injection. The volume and pH of the specimen are measured; in certain instances, cytologic study by the Papanicolaou technique may be used to determine the presence or absence of malignant cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Esophageal reflux of gastric acid may be diagnosed and evaluated by ambulatory pH monitoring (<a href="#bib2852">Triadafilopoulos, Zikos, Regalia, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The patient is NPO for 6 hours before the test. A sensor that measures pH is inserted and positioned via endoscopy. The sensor is then connected to an external recording device and is worn for 24 hours while the patient continues usual daily activities. The result is a computer analysis and graphic display of the results.</p>
<p class="indent">The Bravo pH monitoring system offers the advantage of pH monitoring of the esophagus without the transnasal catheter. The clinician, by means of endoscopy, attaches a capsule (approximately the size of a gel cap) to the patient&#x2019;s esophageal wall. Data related to pH are transmitted from the capsule to a pager-sized receiver that the patient wears. Data are collected for up to 96 hours and then downloaded and analyzed. The capsule spontaneously detaches from the esophagus in 7 to 10 days and then is passed through the patient&#x2019;s digestive system. The accuracy of this method of pH testing is greater than methods in which a catheter is used because the patient can eat normally and continue typical activities during the testing. The patient is evaluated for both acid reflux and nonacid reflux events (<a href="#bib2858">Medtronic, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1588">Laparoscopy (Peritoneoscopy)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">With the tremendous advances in minimally invasive surgery, diagnostic laparoscopy is efficient, cost-effective, and useful in the diagnosis of GI disease. After a pneumoperitoneum (injecting carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity to separate the intestines from the pelvic organs) is created, a small incision is made lateral to the umbilicus, allowing for the insertion of the fiberoptic laparoscope. This permits direct visualization of the organs and structures within the abdomen, permitting visualization and identification of any growths, anomalies, and inflammatory processes. In addition, biopsy samples can be taken from the structures and organs as necessary. This procedure can be used to evaluate peritoneal disease, chronic abdominal pain, abdominal masses, and gallbladder and liver disease. However, laparoscopy has not become an important diagnostic modality in patients with acute abdominal pain, because less invasive tools (e.g., CT and MRI scans) are readily available. Laparoscopy usually requires general anesthesia and sometimes requires that the stomach and bowel be decompressed. Gas (usually carbon dioxide) is insufflated into the peritoneal cavity to create a working space for visualization. One of the benefits of this procedure is that after visualization of a problem, excision (e.g., removal of the gallbladder) can then be performed at the same time, if appropriate.</p>
