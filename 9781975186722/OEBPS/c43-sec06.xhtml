<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;portal hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; elevated pressure in the portal circulation resulting from obstruction of venous flow into and through the liver">Portal hypertension</button></strong> is the increased pressure throughout the portal venous system that results from obstruction of blood flow into and through the damaged liver. Commonly associated with hepatic cirrhosis, it can also occur with noncirrhotic liver disease. Although splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) with possible hypersplenism is a common manifestation of portal hypertension, the two major consequences of portal hypertension are ascites and varices (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</p>
