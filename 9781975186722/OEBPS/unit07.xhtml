<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps">Y</span>ou are working in a community health center with an interdisciplinary team to provide care for patients with human immune deficiency virus (HIV). The team consists of a physician, nurse, pharmacist, social worker, mental health counselor, and a registered dietician. The team is discussing the interdisciplinary management plan for a 21-year-old Hispanic male who recently became positive for HIV infection. The goal is to develop strategies for him to treat his HIV infection and prevent progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). How can you, as the sole nurse on the team, foster open communication, mutual respect, and shared decision-making within the team to achieve quality patient care?</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
