<h4 class="h4" id="s1605">Neoplasms</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Salivary gland neoplasms (tumors or growths) of almost any type may develop in the salivary gland. Malignant (cancerous) salivary gland neoplasms account for more than 0.5% of all malignancies and approximately 3% to 5% of head and neck cancers (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2021d). Risk factors include prior exposure to ionizing radiation to the head and neck, older age, and specific carcinogens introduced in specific work environments (asbestos, plumbing, and woodworking). Most patients with a benign tumor present with painless swelling of the glands; patients with a malignancy tend to have neurologic symptoms (weakness or numbness of the facial nerve) and persistent facial pain (NCI, 2021d). Diagnosis is based on the health history, physical examination, and the results of fine-needle aspiration biopsy.</p>
<p class="indent">Early-stage salivary gland tumors are usually curable with surgery alone. Dissection is carefully performed to preserve the seventh cranial nerve (facial nerve). It may not be possible to safely dissect if the tumor is extensive. Complications from surgery may involve facial nerve dysfunction and Frey syndrome. Frey syndrome, also known as auriculotemporal syndrome, involves facial sweating and flushing in the general location of the (removed) parotid gland that occurs while eating. Frey syndrome may be successfully treated with botulinum toxin type A injections (NCI, 2021d). If the salivary gland tumor is malignant, radiation therapy may follow surgery. Radiation therapy alone may be a treatment choice for tumors thought to be localized or if there is risk of facial nerve damage from surgical intervention. Chemotherapy may be considered in late stages, but due to the many different subtypes of salivary gland cancer, tumor mapping, including immunohistochemistry and genomic profiling, should be used to optimize treatment (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2908">Lassche, van Boxtel, Ligtenberg, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Recurrent tumors usually are more aggressive than initial tumors.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec7">CANCER OF THE ORAL CAVITY AND PHARYNX</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, which can occur in any part of the mouth or throat, are curable if discovered early. Risk factors for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx include any use of any form of tobacco or nicotine (cigarette, cigar, pipe, smokeless tobacco, ENDS), excessive use of alcohol, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), and a history of previous head and neck cancer (NCI, 2021b). Oral cancers are often associated with the combined use of alcohol and tobacco&#x2014;these substances have a synergistic carcinogenic effect. Patient education directed toward avoiding high-risk behaviors is critical to prevent oral cancers.</p>
<p class="indent">In the United States, approximately 53,000 new cases of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer occur annually, with an estimated 10,860 deaths. Men are diagnosed with oral and oropharyngeal cancer in almost 72% of diagnosed cases (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Siegel, Miller, &#x0026; Jemal, 2019</a>). Despite a rise in rates associated with HPV over the past 10 years (0.8% rise each year), patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx have a relatively stable 5-year survival rate of 65.3% (NCI, 2021b; Siegel et&#x00A0;al., 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1606">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Malignancies of the oral cavity are usually squamous cell carcinomas (NCI, 2021c). Any area of the oropharynx can be a site of malignant growths, but the lips, the lateral aspects of the tongue, and the floor of the mouth are most commonly affected. High-risk HPV infection is associated with about 70% of oropharyngeal cancers. Vaccination against HPV shows promise in impacting rates of head and neck cancer. A study of young adults in the United Stated found oral HPV infections (including the two high-risk, cancer-causing types 16 and 18) were 88% lower among young adults who received at least one dose of the vaccine (NCI, 2017).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1607">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many oral cancers produce few or no symptoms in the early stages. Later, the most frequent symptom is a painless sore or lesion that bleeds easily and does not heal. Oral cancer may also present as a red or white patch (leukoplakia) in the mouth or throat. A typical lesion in oral cancer is a painless indurated (hardened) ulcer with raised edges. Depending on the location (tonsil, base of the tongue, soft palate, or pharyngeal wall), the patient may report tenderness, difficulty in chewing, swallowing, or speaking, coughing of blood-tinged sputum, trismus (limited jaw range of motion), weight loss, a neck mass, or enlarged cervical lymph nodes (NCI, 2021c).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1235</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1236" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1236">p. 1236</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1608">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnostic evaluation consists of an oral examination as well as an assessment of the cervical lymph nodes to detect possible metastases. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan (PET-CT scan), MRI, endoscopy, laryngoscopy, and biopsy, including testing of HPV status may be used to detect and guide therapy (NCI, 2021c).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1609">Human Papillomavirus Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">HPV vaccine is generally recommended for all children ages 11 or 12 (can be started at age 9), up to the age of 26 years for women and 21 years for men. Men who have sex with men, transgender men and women, and immunocompromised people, including those with human immune deficiency virus (HIV), may receive the vaccine up to 26&#x00A0;years of age (CDC, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1610">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer, management varies with the nature of the lesion, the preference of the provider, and patient choice. Surgical resection and chemoradiation (CRT) are associated with improved survival for all adults over age 70, including those who are positive for HPV infection (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2910">Lu, Luu, Nguyen, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In cancer of the lip, small lesions are usually excised liberally. Radiation therapy may be more appropriate for larger lesions involving more than one third of the lip because of superior cosmetic results. The choice depends on the extent of the lesion and what is necessary to cure the patient while preserving the best appearance. Tumors larger than 4 cm often recur.</p>
<p class="indent">In cancer of the tongue, treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may preserve function and maintain quality of life. A combination of radioactive interstitial implants (surgical implantation of a radioactive source into the tissue adjacent to or at the tumor site) and external-beam radiation may be used. Total glossectomy (removal of the tongue) remains the principal treatment of advanced stage or cancers at the base of the tongue; long-term data on functional outcomes following these procedures are being studied (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2899">Han, Kuan, Mallen-St. Clair, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Often, cancer of the oral cavity has metastasized through the extensive lymphatic channel in the neck region, requiring a neck dissection and reconstructive surgery of the oral cavity. Reconstructive techniques involve the use of the traditional pedicled (attached and tunneled) regional tissue flaps (graft of tissue with its own blood supply) or the current mainstay of free (cut and removed) tissue transfer most commonly obtained from the pectoralis major, vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous, anterolateral thigh, fibula, or radial forearm. Laryngeal preservation is associated with better speech and verbal communication, but swallowing and aspiration issues remain common functional deficits with total glossectomy and free flap reconstruction (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2899">Han et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1611">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status preoperatively, and a dietary consultation may be necessary. The patient may require enteral (through the GI tract) or parenteral (intravenous [IV]) feedings before and after surgery to maintain adequate nutrition (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>). The interprofessional team, including a registered dietician (RD), provides continual nutritional assessment and reevaluation.</p>
<p class="indent">Verbal communication may be impaired by radical surgery for oral cancer, especially if the larynx is removed. It is therefore vital to assess the patient&#x2019;s ability to communicate in writing before surgery. Pen and paper are provided postoperatively to patients who can use them to communicate. A communication board with commonly used words or pictures is obtained preoperatively and given after surgery to patients who cannot write so that they may point to needed items. Electronic devices, such as tablets or smartphones, may also be options for facilitating communication. The interprofessional team benefits from the input of a speech therapist, with physical and occupational therapists consulted as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperatively, the priority for the nurse is assessing for and maintaining a patent airway. The patient may be unable to manage oral secretions, making suctioning necessary. If grafting was part of the surgery, suctioning is performed with care to prevent damage to the graft. Nurses assess the graft postoperatively for viability. Although color should be assessed (white may indicate arterial occlusion, and blue mottling may indicate venous congestion), it can be difficult to assess the graft by looking into the mouth. A Doppler ultrasound device may be used to locate the pulse at the graft site and to assess tissue perfusion. Depending on the extent of the surgery, the patient may require a temporary or permanent tracheostomy after surgery (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec8">NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH DISORDERS OF THE ORAL CAVITY</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse caring for the patient with disorders of the oral cavity promotes mouth care, ensures adequate food and fluid intake, minimizes pain and discomfort, and prevents infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1612">Promoting Mouth Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Incidences of oral complications, such as infection, during cancer therapy may be decreased and less severe with the incorporation of professional oral care before and during cancer treatment. Guidelines, based on systematic review of the literature, support the implementation of multi-agent combination oral care protocols in patients undergoing head and neck chemotherapy and radiotherapy (radiation therapy) to prevent oral mucositis (OM), a painful inflammatory, typically ulcerative condition that is also referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stomatitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the oral tissues, often associated with some chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy to the head and neck region">stomatitis</button></strong>. Although there are limited data, experts recognize that using saline or sodium bicarbonate rinses increases oral clearance, promotes oral hygiene, and promotes patient comfort (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2902">Hong, Gueiros, Fulton, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The nurse facilitates the patient rinsing or irrigating with a solution of &#x00BD; to 1 teaspoon of baking soda (or &#x00BC;-teaspoon salt) in 8 oz of warm water. The nurse reinforces the need to perform oral care and provides such care to patients who cannot provide it for themselves. Chlorhexidine has been studied more rigorously than other rinses and is generally not recommended for the prevention of OM, specifically not for patients undergoing head and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1237" title="1237"></span>neck radiotherapy (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2902">Hong et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). There is continued debate about the efficacy of <em>magic mouthwash</em>, particularly for chemotherapy-induced OM. The recipe for the mouthwash varies and frequently involves out-of-pocket expense for the patient, but most commonly contains diphenhydramine, aluminum-magnesium hydroxide, and viscous lidocaine, with intended mechanism of action to both numb and protect the mouth. More research needs to be done on OM treatment and prevention (Uberoi, Brown, &#x0026; Gupta, 2019a, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Exciting developments regarding intra-oral photobiomodulation (PBM), specifically low-level laser therapy, show positive impact on the prevention of OM in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy with and without chemotherapy (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2902">Hong et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If specific antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, or antiviral agents are indicated (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Maria, Eliopoulos, &#x0026; Muanza, 2017</a>), the nurse administers the prescribed medications and instructs the patient on how to administer the medications at home. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological response to treatment.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;xerostomia:&lt;/b&gt; dryness of the mouth">Xerostomia</button></strong> (dryness of the mouth) is a frequent sequela of oral cancer, particularly when the salivary glands have been exposed to radiation or major surgery. It is also seen in patients who are receiving psychopharmacologic agents, taking multiple medications, or using drugs recreationally; in patients who have rheumatic diseases, eating disorders (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Villa, Nordio, &#x0026; Gohel, 2015</a>) or HIV infection; and in patients who cannot close the mouth and, as a result, breathe through the mouth instead of the nose. Current recommendations to treat xerostomia include sipping water, using oral mucosal lubricants (saliva substitutes topically applied), incorporating the use of newer edible saliva substitutes such as oral moisturizing jelly (OMJ), and taking medications that stimulate saliva production (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Nuchit, Lam-ubol, &#x0026; Paemuang, 2020</a>). The hope is that providing oral moisture increases swallowing ability, and ultimately improves nutritional status for these patients.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1613">Ensuring Adequate Food and Fluid Intake</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Determination of nutritional intake goals requires consideration of the patient&#x2019;s weight, age, and level of activity. A daily calorie count may be necessary to determine the exact quantity of food and fluid ingested. This intake should include enteral feedings, oral intake, and supplements. The frequency of intake; presence of symptoms such as oral discomfort/pain, dysphagia, nausea; increased or decreased saliva or mucous production; and changes in taste or smell all impact the typically diminishing food intake seen in these patients. The social aspects of eating, reasonable expectations for the timing and amount of intake, and the importance of supportive people are all important considerations. Recommendations to navigate this challenging time include involving a registered dietician or other health care professional with specific nutritional expertise (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2937">Sandm&#x00E6;l, Sand, Bye, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The goal is to help the patient attain and maintain desirable body weight and level of energy, as well as to promote the healing of tissue.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1614">Supporting a Positive Self-Image</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A patient who has a disfiguring oral condition or has undergone disfiguring surgery may experience an alteration in self-image. The patient is encouraged to verbalize the perceived and actual change in body appearance and to realistically discuss changes or losses. The nurse offers support while the patient verbalizes fears and negative feelings (withdrawal, depressed mood, anger). The nurse listens attentively and determines the patient&#x2019;s needs and individualizes the plan of care.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should determine the patient&#x2019;s concerns about relationships with others. Referral to support groups, a psychiatric liaison nurse, a social worker, or a spiritual advisor may be useful in helping the patient cope with anxieties and fears. The patient&#x2019;s progress toward development of positive self-esteem is documented. The nurse should be alert to signs of effective and ineffective grieving and should document emotional changes. By providing acceptance and support, the nurse encourages the patient to verbalize feelings.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1615">Minimizing Pain and Discomfort</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Oral lesions can be painful. Strategies to reduce pain and discomfort include avoiding foods that are spicy, hot, or hard (e.g., pretzels, nuts). A soft or liquid diet may be preferred. The patient is instructed about mouth care, including the use of a soft toothbrush and any prescribed rinses or topical medications. The patient may require an analgesic agent such as viscous lidocaine or opioids, as prescribed. The nurse can reduce the patient&#x2019;s fear of pain by providing information about pain control methods.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1616">Preventing Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Leukopenia (a decrease in white blood cells) may result from radiation, chemotherapy, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and some medications used to treat HIV infection. Leukopenia reduces defense mechanisms, increasing the risk of infections. Malnutrition, which is also common among these patients, may further decrease resistance to infection. If the patient has diabetes, the risk of infection is further increased.</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory results should be evaluated frequently and the patient&#x2019;s temperature checked every 4 to 8 hours for an elevation that may indicate infection. Visitors who might transmit microorganisms are prohibited if the patient&#x2019;s immunologic system is depressed. Sensitive skin tissues are protected from trauma to maintain skin integrity and prevent infection. Aseptic technique is necessary when changing dressings. Desquamation (shedding of the epidermis) is a reaction to radiation therapy that can lead to a break in skin integrity and subsequent infection. Dry desquamation can be treated with topical lotions, but wet desquamation requires individualized treatment (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Signs of wound infection (redness, swelling, drainage, tenderness) are reported to the primary provider. Antibiotics may be prescribed prophylactically.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient who is recovering from treatment of an oral disorder is instructed about mouth care, nutrition, prevention of infection, and signs and symptoms of complications <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1238" title="1238"></span>(see <a href="#ct39-2">Chart 39-2</a>). Methods of preparing nutritious foods that are seasoned according to the patient&#x2019;s preference and at the preferred temperature are explained to the patient and family. For some patients, it may be more convenient (but also more expensive) to use commercial baby foods than to prepare liquid and soft diets. The patient who cannot take foods orally may receive enteral or parenteral nutrition; the nurse should demonstrate administration techniques and facilitate a return demonstration by the patient and/or caregiver(s).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">For patients with oral cancer, instructions are provided in the use and care of any dentures. The importance of keeping dressings clean and the need for conscientious oral hygiene are emphasized.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuing and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The need for ongoing care in the home depends on the patient&#x2019;s condition. The patient, family members, and other health care team members responsible for home care (e.g., nurse, speech therapist, registered dietician/nutritionist, and psychologist) work together to prepare an individual plan of care.</p>
<p class="indent">If suctioning of the mouth or tracheostomy tube is required, the necessary equipment is obtained and the patient and caregivers are taught how to use it. Considerations include the control of odors and humidification of the home to keep secretions moist. The patient and caregivers are educated to assess for obstruction, hemorrhage, and infection, as well as what actions to take if they occur. The nurse may provide physical care, monitor for changes in the patient&#x2019;s physical status (e.g., skin integrity, nutritional status, respiratory function), and assess the adequacy of pain control measures. The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to manage incisions, drains, and feeding tubes and the use of recommended strategies for communication. The ability of the patient and family to accept physical, psychological, and role changes is assessed and addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Follow-up visits to the primary provider are important to monitor the patient&#x2019;s condition and to determine the need for modifications in treatment and general care. Because patients and their family members, as well as health care providers, tend to focus on the most obvious needs and issues, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices and refers them to appropriate practitioners. The nurse also reinforces instructions in an effort to promote the patient&#x2019;s self-care and comfort.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec9">NECK DISSECTION</p>
<p class="nonindent">Deaths from malignancies of the head and neck are primarily attributable to regional metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes in the neck and extra capsular spread, which is a specific characteristic of regional metastasis where the malignant tumor in the lymph node extends into the surrounding connective tissue (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Stack &#x0026; Moreno, 2019</a>). Metastasis, both regional and distant, occurs by way of the lymphatics before the primary lesion has been treated. This regional metastasis is not amenable to surgical resection and responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The cervical lymph nodes are classified as anterior or posterior and divided into anatomic regions/nodal levels for classification (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2895">Gr&#x00E8;goire, Ang, Budach, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Stack &#x0026; Moreno, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#ff39-3">Fig. 39-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A radical neck dissection involves removal of all cervical lymph nodes from the mandible to the clavicle and removal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and spinal accessory nerve on one side of the neck. The associated complications include shoulder drop/dysfunction and poor cosmesis (visible neck depression). Because of the high mortality and known complications, a radical neck dissection is now only performed when the extent and growth pattern of the cancer require aggressive intervention. Modified radical neck dissection, which preserves one or more of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1239" title="1239"></span>nonlymphatic structures (internal jugular vein, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the spinal accessory nerve) is used more often. A selective neck dissection (in comparison to a radical neck dissection or modified radical neck dissection) preserves one or more of the lymph node groups that are typically removed in a radical neck dissection. The selective neck dissection is the treatment usually used in oral cavity cancer for patients who are infected with HPV (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Sabatini &#x0026; Chiocca, 2019</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Stack &#x0026; Moreno, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#ff39-4">Fig. 39-4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Reconstructive techniques may be performed with a variety of grafts. A cutaneous flap (skin and subcutaneous tissue), such as the deltopectoral flap, may be used. A myocutaneous platysma flap (subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and skin) is a more frequently used graft; the pectoralis major muscle is usually used. For large grafts, a microvascular free flap may be used. This involves the transfer of muscle, skin, or bone with an artery and vein to the area of reconstruction, using microinstrumentation. Areas used for a free flap include the scapula, the radial area of the forearm, or the anterolateral thigh (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Stack &#x0026; Moreno, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include increased knowledge of surgical procedure and treatment plan, maintenance of respiratory status, decreased pain, viability of the graft, maintenance of adequate intake of food and fluids, effective coping strategies (for patient and caregivers), effective communication, maintenance of shoulder and neck motion, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> P<small>REOPERATIVE</small> P<small>ATIENT</small> E<small>DUCATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Before surgery, the patient should be informed about the nature and extent of the surgery and what to expect in the postoperative period. Preoperative education addresses interventions that cover the entire perioperative period. As part of the informed consent process, the patient should be made aware of the potential/actual risks and benefits of the procedure as well as other treatment options, and the projected outcome if the procedure is not done. The patient is encouraged to ask questions and to express concerns about the upcoming surgery and the expected results. During this exchange, the nurse has an opportunity to assess the patient&#x2019;s coping abilities, answer questions, and develop a plan for offering assistance. A sense of mutual understanding and rapport make the postoperative experience less traumatic for the patient. The patient&#x2019;s expressions of concern, anxieties, and fears guide the nurse in providing support postoperatively.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> G<small>ENERAL</small> P<small>OSTOPERATIVE</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The general postoperative nursing interventions are similar to those presented in <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a> and are directed toward the identified nursing diagnoses and goals.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> A<small>IRWAY</small> C<small>LEARANCE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After the endotracheal tube or airway has been removed and the effects of the anesthesia have worn off, the patient may be placed in the Fowler position to facilitate breathing and promote comfort. This position also increases lymphatic and venous drainage, facilitates swallowing, decreases venous pressure on the skin flaps, and prevents regurgitation and aspiration of stomach contents. If the patient has a tracheostomy, the nurse performs focused assessment and care of the stoma (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). Signs of respiratory distress, such as dyspnea, cyanosis, changes in mental status, and changes in vital signs, are assessed because they may suggest edema, hemorrhage/hematoma formation, inadequate oxygenation, or inadequate drainage.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>In the immediate postoperative period, the nurse assesses for stridor (coarse, high-pitched sound on inspiration) by listening frequently over the trachea with a stethoscope. This finding must be reported immediately because it indicates obstruction of the airway.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Pneumonia may occur in the postoperative phase if pulmonary secretions are not removed. To aid in the removal of secretions, coughing and deep breathing are encouraged. With the nurse supporting the neck, the patient should assume a sitting position so that excessive secretions can be coughed up and expectorated. If this is ineffective, the patient&#x2019;s respiratory tract may have to be suctioned. Care is taken to protect the suture lines during suctioning. If a tracheostomy tube is in place, suctioning is performed through the tube. The patient may also be instructed on use of Yankauer suction (tonsil-tip suction) to remove oral secretions. Humidified air or oxygen is provided through the tracheostomy to keep secretions thin. Temperature should not be taken orally.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse assesses and manages pain and the patient&#x2019;s fear of pain. Patients with head and neck cancer often report less pain than patients with other types of cancer; however, the nurse needs to be aware that each person&#x2019;s pain experience is different. The nurse works with the patient to establish reasonable pain goals and creates an interprofessional plan to meet those mutually defined goals. Patient-controlled analgesia may be prescribed for postoperative pain management (see Chapters 9 and 16).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> W<small>OUND</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Wound drainage tubes are usually inserted during surgery to prevent the collection of fluid subcutaneously. The drainage tubes are connected to a portable suction device (e.g., Jackson-Pratt), and the container is emptied periodically. Between 80 and 120 mL of serosanguineous secretions may drain over the first 24 hours. Excessive drainage may be indicative of a chyle fistula or hemorrhage (see later discussion). Dressings are reinforced as needed and are observed for evidence of hemorrhage and constriction, which impair respiration and perfusion of the graft. A graft, if present, is assessed for color and temperature and for the presence of a pulse, if applicable, to determine viability. The graft should be pale pink and warm to the touch. The surgical incisions are also assessed for signs of infection (purulent, malodorous drainage), which are reported immediately. Prophylactic antibiotics may be prescribed in the early postoperative period. Aseptic technique is used when cleansing skin around the drains; dressings are changed as prescribed by the surgeon, usually on the second through the fifth postoperative days. Care should be taken to not apply excessive pressure to the surgical site in order to not impair flap perfusion and viability (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Hudson &#x0026; Carr, 2020</a>). If radiation is planned (either with or without chemotherapy), brachytherapy catheters are inserted intraoperatively (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Stack &#x0026; Moreno, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> A<small>DEQUATE</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The interprofessional team assesses the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status preoperatively; early intervention to correct nutritional imbalances may decrease the risk of postoperative complications. Frequently, nutrition is less than optimal because of inadequate intake and nutritional support is required before surgery or the start of radiation due to the psychological stress of the cancer diagnosis, the location of the tumor(s), and diagnostic procedures. Prophylactic nutritional support using a tube feeding is common and may prevent weight loss, reduce fluid imbalances, decrease hospitalizations, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1241" title="1241"></span>increase treatment tolerance (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2937">Sandm&#x00E6;l et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Supplements that are nutritionally dense may help reestablish a positive nitrogen balance. They may be taken enterally by mouth, by a nasogastric (NG) feeding tube, or by a gastrostomy feeding tube (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient who can chew may take food by mouth; the patient&#x2019;s chewing ability determines whether some diet modification (e.g., soft, pur&#x00E9;ed, or liquid foods) is necessary. Food preferences should also be discussed with the patient. Oral care before eating may enhance the patient&#x2019;s appetite, and oral care after eating is important to prevent infection and dental caries.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>S<small>UPPORTING</small> P<small>ATIENT</small> S<small>ELF</small>-E<small>STEEM AND THE</small> N<small>EEDS OF</small> C<small>AREGIVERS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Preoperatively, information about the planned surgery is given to the patient and family. Any questions are answered as accurately as possible. Postoperatively, psychological nursing interventions are aimed at supporting the patient who has had a change in body image or who has major concerns related to the prognosis. The patient may have difficulty communicating and may be concerned about having the ability to breathe and swallow normally. Head and neck cancer recovery is unique in that the patient&#x2019;s behavioral issues (e.g., HPV infection status, alcohol, smoking) often directly relate to the underlying cause of the cancer. The psychological adaptation required after a disfiguring surgery, and the social complications inherent in swallowing and speech are profound. The <em>patient&#x2013;caregiver dyad</em> is often considered a single unit, which reinforces the need to consider both entities, as well as their interrelationship (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2888">Dri, Bressan, Cadorin, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The person who has had extensive neck surgery often is sensitive about their appearance. This can occur when the operative area is covered by bulky dressings, when the incision line is visible, or later after healing has occurred and the appearance of the neck and possibly the lower face has been significantly altered. If the nurse accepts the patient&#x2019;s appearance and expresses a positive, optimistic attitude, the patient is more likely to be encouraged. The patient also needs an opportunity to express fears and concerns regarding the success of the surgery and the prognosis. The American Cancer Society (ACS) may be a resource to provide a volunteer who meets with the patient either preoperatively or postoperatively and shares their own experience about the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. The Look Good Feel Better programs of the ACS provide information about clothing and cosmetics that can be used to improve body image and self-esteem (see the Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">People with cancer of the head and neck frequently have used alcohol or tobacco before surgery; postoperatively, they are encouraged to abstain from these substances. Alternative methods of coping need to be explored. A referral to Alcoholics Anonymous, a smoking cessation program, and family counseling may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> E<small>FFECTIVE</small> C<small>OMMUNICATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Communication plans begin preoperatively, when the patient and family determine which method of communication will be the best postoperatively. Useful communication methods for the patient who has undergone a laryngectomy include dry-erase boards, writing materials, pictorial guides, computer aids, smart phones, tablets, and hand signals. During the postoperative period, the call bell must be readily accessible to the patient at all times. For the patient who is intubated and mechanically ventilated postoperatively, not being able to communicate well can result in anxiety, depression, and frustration, which can lead to prolonged stress and increased hospitalization (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2906">Koszalinski, Heidel, &#x0026; McCarthy, 2020</a>). (See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct39-3">Chart 39-3</a>.)</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse obtains a consultation with a speech-language pathologist. Alternative speech techniques, such as a voice prosthesis or esophageal speech, may be taught by a speech-language pathologist (see <a href="c18.xhtml">Chapter 18</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Envisioning a Positive Future: Patients Who Are Communication Vulnerable</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Koszalinski, R. S., Heidel, R. E., &#x0026; McCarthy, J. (2020). Difficulty envisioning a positive future: Secondary analyses in patients in intensive care who are communication vulnerable. <em>Nursing &#x0026; Health Sciences</em>, <em>22</em>(2), 374&#x2013;380.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study explored the experience of patients who, for myriad reasons, find themselves unable to communicate in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This secondary analysis was based on an equivalent control group design. Data were analyzed with a mixed-effect analysis of variance (ANOVA; between and within groups), repeated measure to compare the control and treatment groups over time. The focus of this analysis was on considering the impact of a nurse-led electronic communication intervention, called <em>Speak for Myself Voice</em> (SFMV), on depression and anxiety. Data were collected using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) from 36 participants in a trauma surgical ICU, neuro ICU, progressive care unit, medical ICU, and cardiovascular ICU at an academic medical center in rural Tennessee.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Although change was detected from preintervention to postintervention on several questions on the HADS, one item piqued the interest of the researchers: &#x201C;I look forward with enjoyment to things.&#x201D; There was a statistically significant interaction (<em>p</em> = 0.017) from preintervention to postintervention. This indicates that patients who are mechanically ventilated or unable to communicate because of obstruction, trauma, or surgical resection (including head and neck procedures) may be silently suffering with depressive symptoms.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">These results are supported by other studies in the literature. Nurses have the unique ability to make sure patients who are unable to communicate feel seen and heard. Intentional presence and honest interest in the patient as a person by the nurse opens the door to communication that extends beyond mere vocalizations and provides the patient comfort.</p>

<p class="processppara">Excision of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and spinal accessory nerve results in weakness at the shoulder that can cause shoulder drop, which is a forward curvature of the shoulder. Many problems can be avoided with a conscientious exercise program. These exercises are usually started in collaboration with a physical therapist after the drains have been removed and the neck incision is sufficiently healed. The purpose of the exercises depicted in <a href="#ff39-5">Figure 39-5</a> is to promote maximal shoulder function and neck motion after surgery.</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1rLast"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The surgeon is notified immediately, because a vascular or ligature tear requires surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Chyle Leak.</span> A chyle leak (milklike, lymphatic fluid drainage from the thoracic duct into the thoracic cavity) may develop as a result of damage to the thoracic duct during surgery. Although not very common (3% to 5.7% of cases), this leak may be recognized during surgery (where it can be repaired immediately) or in the postoperative setting, especially when oral intake begins. If a chyle leak is suspected postoperatively, conservative measures to limit increases in intrathoracic pressure will reduce the flow of chyle fluid in the thoracic duct. Recommended interventions include initiating enteral feeding or supporting a low fat diet focused on the intake of small- and medium-chain fatty acids (chylous fluid is formed from long-chain fatty acids). Medium-chain triglycerides/fats, like those found in coconut oil, are metabolized in the liver into ketones to provide energy without the formation of chyle. Other interventions include fluid and electrolyte replacement, activity restriction, head of bed elevation, stool softeners (to prevent straining), and occasionally, pressure dressings. Providers often prescribe octreotide, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone somatostatin, that works primarily by inhibiting the release of gastrointestinal hormones that regulate digestion and absorption, thereby reducing lymph flow and decreasing the chyle flow (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Rudrappa &#x0026; Paul, 2019</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Stack &#x0026; Moreno, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Nerve Injury.</span> Nerve injury can occur if the spinal accessory, marginal mandibular (branch of the facial nerve), vagus, phrenic, hypoglossal, lingual, or brachial plexus nerves are severed or injured during surgery. Because lower facial paralysis may occur as a result of injury to the facial nerve, this complication is observed for and reported. The patient with nerve damage may have difficulty swallowing liquids and food because of the partial lack of sensation of the glottis, impaired tongue movement, or vagus nerve injury. Speech therapy may be indicated to assist with the problems related to nerve injury. Shoulder dysfunction is most common in radical neck dissection and often requires extensive physical rehabilitation.</p>

Patients who require oral suctioning or who have a tracheostomy may be very anxious about their care at home; the transition to home can be eased if the caregiver is given several opportunities to demonstrate the ability to meet the patient&#x2019;s needs (see <a href="#ct39-4">Chart 39-4</a>). The patient and caregiver are also instructed about possible complications, specifically bleeding and respiratory distress, and when to notify the primary provider.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Feeding via the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;enteric:&lt;/b&gt; of or relating to the intestines">enteric</button></strong> route infers that the intestines are receiving nutrients.

<h6 class="h6">Administering Tube Feedings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tube feedings are given to meet nutritional requirements when oral intake is inadequate or not possible and the GI tract is functional. The feedings are delivered to the stomach, duodenum, or proximal jejunum and help preserve GI integrity by preserving normal intestinal and hepatic metabolism. Tube feedings have several advantages over parenteral nutrition: they are lower in cost, safer, usually well tolerated by the patient, and easier to use in extended care facilities and in the patient&#x2019;s home. When possible, the physiological-based preference is to <em>feed the gut</em>.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Nasoduodenal or nasojejunal feeding is indicated when the esophagus and stomach need to be bypassed or when the patient is at risk for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aspiration:&lt;/b&gt; inhalation of either oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower airways">aspiration</button></strong> (i.e., inhalation of fluids or foods into the trachea and bronchial tree). For tube feedings longer than 4 weeks, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are preferred for administration of medications or nutrition. Indications for enteral nutrition are summarized in <a href="#tt39-2">Table 39-2</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Osmolality</p>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osmolality:&lt;/b&gt; the number of milliosmoles (the standard unit of osmotic pressure) per kilogram of solvent; expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg). (The term &lt;em&gt;osmolality&lt;/em&gt; is used more often than &lt;em&gt;osmolarity&lt;/em&gt; to evaluate serum and urine.)">osmolality</button></strong> of normal body fluids (i.e., concentration) is approximately 300 mOsm/kg. The body attempts to keep the osmolality of the contents of the stomach and intestines at this level. Osmolality is an important consideration for patients receiving tube feedings through the duodenum or jejunum because feeding formulas with a high osmolality may lead to undesirable effects. For example, when a concentrated solution of high osmolality entering the stomach is taken in quickly or in large amounts, the small intestines expand and water moves rapidly into the intestinal lumen from fluid surrounding the organs and the vascular compartment. The patient may have feelings of fullness, nausea, cramping, dizziness, diaphoresis, and osmotic diarrhea, collectively termed <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dumping syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; physiologic response to rapid emptying of gastric contents into the small intestine; manifested by nausea, weakness, sweating, palpitations, syncope, and possibly diarrhea (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; vagotomy syndrome)">dumping syndrome</button></strong>. Dumping syndrome can lead to dehydration, hypotension, and tachycardia. Patients fed by the small intestinal route vary in the degree to which they tolerate the effects of high osmolality; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1245" title="1245"></span>the nurse needs to be knowledgeable about the patient&#x2019;s formula and take steps to prevent this undesired effect. The small intestines may be able to adapt to a formula of high osmolality if it is initiated at a low hourly rate that is advanced slowly (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Seres, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Formulas</p>
<p class="nonindent">The choice of formula to be delivered by tube feeding is influenced by the status of the GI tract and the nutritional needs of the patient. Formula characteristics that are considered include the chemical composition of the nutrient source (protein, carbohydrates, fat), caloric density, osmolality, fiber content, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and cost. Enteral formulas contain 70% to 85% free water and are not designed to meet total fluids needs (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Seres, 2019</a>). A wide variety of containers, delivery systems, and enteral pumps are available for use with tube feedings.</p>
<p class="indent">Various tube feeding formulas are available commercially. Polymeric formulas are the most common and are composed of protein (10% to 15%), carbohydrates (50% to 60%), and fats (30% to 35%). Standard polymeric formulas are undigested and require that the patient has relatively normal digestive function and absorptive capacity. Specialty formulas may be prescribed to treat disease-specific disorders (e.g., diabetes), organ-specific disorders (e.g., renal, pulmonary, or hepatic), sepsis, or trauma, or to support wound-healing or immune-modulation. Chemically defined or <em>predigested</em> formulas contain easier-to-absorb nutrients. Modular products contain only one major nutrient, such as protein, and are used to enhance commercially prepared products. Fiber, either premixed in or added to formulas, helps bulk the stool to decrease the occurrence of both diarrhea and constipation (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2915">McClave, Taylor, Martindale, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some feedings are given as supplements, and others are given to meet the patient&#x2019;s total nutritional needs. Registered dietitians (RD), registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN), and certified nutrition support clinicians collaborate with primary providers and nurses to determine the best formula for each patient. The volume of formula delivered varies depending on the caloric density of the formula and the energy needs of the patient. The overall goal is to achieve positive nitrogen balance and weight maintenance or gain without producing discomfort or diarrhea.</p>
<p class="h7">Administration Methods <img class="m" src="images/watch.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfebf91adbcd" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Administering a Continuous Tube Feeding Using a Feeding Pump and a Prefilled, Closed Tube Feeding Set-Up</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The tube feeding method chosen depends on the location of the tube in the GI tract, patient tolerance, convenience, and cost. Large-bore (larger than 12-Fr) nasogastric (NG) tubes can be uncomfortable and their usefulness for tube feedings is limited; however, they may be used for administration of short-term feedings (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Mueller, 2017</a>). Small-bore (Dobhoff) tubes that are typically inserted into the jejunum with a guidewire and manufactured for tube feedings, are better tolerated for up to 6 weeks; however, they require diligent monitoring and frequent flushing to remain patent.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolus and intermittent drip tube feeding methods are practical and inexpensive options for the patient receiving tube feedings who resides at home or in a long-term care facility; however, these methods may be poorly tolerated in patients who are acutely ill. Bolus infusion requires dividing the total daily feeding volume into 4 to 6 feeds throughout the day. Boluses can be given into the stomach through a large (50-mL) syringe via gravity (see <a href="#ff39-6">Fig. 39-6</a>). The typical volume is 200 to 400 mL of feeding over a 15- to 60-minute period, but these parameters should be outlined in the provider&#x2019;s prescription (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2877">Bischoff et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Bolus feedings can be delivered as quickly as the patient can tolerate them, but are initiated slowly, increasing the rate as tolerated. With gravity feedings, raising or lowering the syringe above the abdominal wall regulates the rate of flow. The amount and flow rate is often determined by the patient&#x2019;s reaction. If the patient feels full, it may be desirable to slow the delivery time or give smaller volumes more frequently. The intermittent gravity drip feeding method requires administering feedings over 30 minutes or longer at designated intervals by a reservoir enteral bag and tubing, with the flow rate regulated by a roller clamp or automated pump.</p>

<p class="indent">Continuous feeding is the delivery of feedings incrementally by a slow infusion over long periods. Slow drip feedings are recommended for patients who are critically ill, patients at high risk for aspiration, patients at risk for intolerance (e.g., patients with pancreatitis), and for small bowel feedings (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata, Carrera, Harvey, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Enteral feeding pumps control the delivery rate of the formula (see <a href="#ff39-7">Fig. 39-7</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1246" title="1246"></span>They allow for a constant flow rate and can infuse a viscous formula through a small-diameter feeding tube. However, they do not allow the patient as much flexibility as intermittent feedings. Portable lightweight enteral pumps are available for home use. In addition, feeding pumps have built-in alarms that signal when the bag is empty, the battery is low, or the tube is occluded. The patient and caregiver need to be aware of these alarms and know how to troubleshoot the pump.</p>

<p class="indent">An alternative to the continuous infusion method is cyclic feeding, in which the infused feeding is given by an enteral feeding pump over 8 to 18 hours. Feedings may be infused at night to avoid interrupting the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle. Cyclic infusions may be appropriate for patients who are being weaned from tube feedings to an oral diet, for patients who cannot eat enough and need supplements, and for patients at home who need daytime hours free from the pump.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/covid.jpg" alt=""/> <img class="m" src="images/icon17-fat.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and respiratory failure necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation may require the delivery of enteral nutrition (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion of severe COVID-19 pneumonia). Guidelines developed by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) stipulate that enteral nutrition should be initiated for these patients within 36 hours of admission to the intensive care unit (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2914">Martindale, Patel, Taylor, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). These guidelines should be implemented unless the decision has been made that the patient receives end-of-life palliative care. Large-bore nasogastric tubes are the preferred route of delivery; these can be placed rapidly and are less prone to clogging compared to small-bore nasoduodenal or nasojejunal feeding tube. Therefore, there is less risk of contamination for nurses and other providers responsible for inserting or manipulating the feeding tubes (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2914">Martindale et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">However, inserting a nasogastric feeding tube still incurs risk. Placement of a nasogastric feeding tube can generate a cough, which can produce sputum; consequently, placing a nasogastric tube is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. When inserting a nasogastric tube in a patient with known or suspected COVID-19, whether for feeding or for decompression, the nurse should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for description of PPE) (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Anderson, 2020</a>). In addition, if possible, the patient&#x2019;s mouth should be covered with a mask during the procedure (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2914">Martindale et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). The feedings should be delivered as continuous rather than bolus infusions (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2914">Martindale et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who are intubated and mechanically ventilated experience an improvement in their respiratory status when they are placed in the prone position (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>); however, if they are also receiving enteral nutrition, they are at greater risk for aspiration in this position. These patients should be placed in reverse Trendelenburg, with their heads elevated 10 to 25&#x00A0;degrees, to minimize this risk (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2914">Martindale et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Some experts also advocate that feedings be held for 1 hour prior to the patient being moved into the prone position, to further reduce the risk of aspiration (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Anderson, 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Arkin, Krishnan, &#x0026; Chang, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">The temperature and volume of the feeding, the flow rate, and the patient&#x2019;s total fluid intake are important factors to consider when tube feedings are given. The schedule of tube feedings, including the correct quantity and frequency, is maintained. The nurse must carefully monitor the drip rate and avoid administering fluids too rapidly.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients receiving tube feedings, measuring gastric residual volumes (GRVs) by removing gastric contents with a large syringe at routine intervals has been a commonly prescribed practice. However, the usefulness of measuring GRVs has not been validated by research; furthermore, this practice may cause clogging of gastric tubes (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Previously, GRV in excess of 250 to 500 mL had been thought to indicate feeding intolerance. Other indicators of feeding tolerance that the nurse needs to consider include abdominal distention, patient reports of discomfort, vomiting, hypoactive bowel sounds, changes in passing flatus, and presence of diarrhea (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2915">McClave et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). The most recent guidelines for assessment and provision of nutrition in the patient who is critically ill, authored by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), do not advocate using GRVs to monitor tolerance of enteral feedings (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2915">McClave et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Research findings show <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1247" title="1247"></span>that GRVs between 250 and 500 mL did not increase the incidence of vomiting, aspiration, or pneumonia (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2915">McClave et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Although feedings should not routinely be held if residuals are 250 to 500 mL, measures to decrease the risk of aspiration should be implemented (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2915">McClave et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). If agency protocols and policies include assessing GRV as part of routine care, research and guidelines support holding the feeding for 2 hours only if the GRV is greater than 500 mL (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2915">McClave et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Growing evidence supports moving away from routine assessment of GRVs (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Seres, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Maintaining tube function is an ongoing responsibility of the nurse, patient, primary provider, and caregiver. To ensure patency and to decrease the chance of bacterial growth, sludge build-up, or occlusion of the tube, at least 30&#x00A0;mL of water flush is recommended for adults receiving tube feedings in each of the following instances (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2877">Bischoff, Austin, Boeykens, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>):</p>

<li><span>When the tube feeding is discontinued or interrupted for any reason</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Water used to flush these tubes must be recorded as fluid intake. Although distribution (i.e., tap) or drinking (i.e., distribution and bottled) water can be used for flushes, the likelihood of contamination with pathogens must be considered. Purified (contaminant free; distillation or ultrafiltration) or sterile (purified water free of microorganisms and pyrogens) should be used for medication preparation. The use of sterile water is considered best practice for patients who are immunocompromised and for reconstitution of powdered formula (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2877">Bischoff et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Potential complications of enteral therapy are noted in <a href="#tt39-3">Table 39-3</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Medications by Tube</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When different types of medications are prescribed, a bolus method is used for administration that is compatible with the medication&#x2019;s preparation. The feeding is paused, and the tube is flushed with at least 15 mL of water before and at least 15 mL of water after medication administration (30&#x00A0;mL total). Each medication should be prepared and administered separately, with a 15-mL flush provided between medications. When small-bore feeding tubes for continuous infusion are irrigated after administration of medications, a 20-mL or larger syringe is used because the pressure generated by smaller syringes could rupture the tube. Nursing judgment is required to individualize care; institutional protocols and pharmacist input should guide the primary provider&#x2019;s prescriptions regarding medication choices and route of delivery. Consideration needs to be given to preparations (tablets that can be crushed/dissolved; availability of elixirs), absorption (e.g., some medications bind to enteral feedings, location of distal end of tube in the stomach or jejunum), and the patient&#x2019;s fluid volume status (i.e., increased number of medications necessitates increases in the flush/water that is administered).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Delivery Systems</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tube feeding formula is delivered to patients by either an open or a closed system. The open system is packaged as a liquid or a powder to be mixed with water that is either poured into a feeding container or given by a large syringe. The feeding container (which is hung on a pole) and the tubing used with the open system should be changed every 24&#x00A0;hours (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2877">Bischoff et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The open system can be used for bolus feedings, intermittent feedings, or continuous drip feedings and can be delivered by push (with a syringe and plunger), gravity (syringe with plunger removed or gravity bag with roller clamp), or pump. To avoid bacterial contamination, the formula hang time in the bag at room temperature should never exceed what the formula manufacturer recommends, which is usually no more than 4 to 8 hours. Closed delivery systems use a prefilled, sterile container of about 1 L of formula that is spiked with enteral tubing and allows a typical hang time of 24 hours at room temperature. The closed delivery system must always use a pump to control formula rate in order to avoid dispensing a large formula volume in a short period of time. Closed systems lower the risk of infection from bacterial contamination (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Normal Bowel Elimination Pattern</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients receiving gastric or enteric tube feedings can experience diarrhea or constipation. Possible causes of diarrhea include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Intolerance to enteral nutrition, related to underlying disease</span></li>
<li><span>Malnutrition: A decrease in the intestinal absorptive area can cause diarrhea</span></li>
<li><span>Medication therapy:</span></li></ul>
<p class="BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Elixir-based medications&#x2014;often contain sorbitol, which can act as a cathartic</p>

<li><span>Concomitant lactose intolerance</span></li>
<li><span>Concomitant hyperthyroidism</span></li>
<li><span>Dumping syndrome: Formula is infused into the small intestine quickly or formula bypasses the stomach too readily into the small intestine and causes expansion of the intestinal wall. This leads to bloating, cramping, diarrhea, dizziness, diaphoresis, and weakness. Measures <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1248" title="1248"></span>for managing the GI symptoms associated with dumping syndrome are presented in <a href="#ct39-6">Chart 39-6</a>.</span></li>

<p class="indent">Possible causes of constipation include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Inadequate water intake: Tube feedings typically do not meet total fluid needs and additional water needs to be given.</span></li>
<li><span>Administration of fiber-free tube feeding formulas</span></li>
<li><span>Concomitant use of opioids</span></li></ul>

<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Adequate Hydration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse carefully monitors hydration because in many cases the patient cannot communicate the need for water. Water flushes are given every 4 hours and after feedings to prevent hypertonic dehydration. The feeding may be initially given as a continuous drip in order to help the patient develop tolerance, especially for hyperosmolar solutions. Key nursing interventions include observing for signs of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, thirst, decreased urine output); administering water routinely; and monitoring intake and output, residual volume, and fluid balance.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Coping Ability</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The psychosocial goal of nursing care is to support and encourage the patient to accept physical changes and to convey hope that daily progressive improvement is possible. If the patient is having difficulty adjusting to the treatment, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1249" title="1249"></span>nurse intervenes by encouraging self-care within the parameters of the patient&#x2019;s activity level. In addition, the nurse reinforces an optimistic approach by identifying indicators of progress (daily weight trends, electrolyte balance, absence of nausea and diarrhea, improvement in plasma proteins).</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Preventing Dumping Syndrome</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following strategies may help prevent some of the uncomfortable signs and symptoms of dumping syndrome related to tube feeding:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Slow the formula instillation rate to provide time for carbohydrates and electrolytes to be diluted.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Administer feedings at room temperature, because temperature extremes stimulate peristalsis.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Administer feeding by continuous drip (if tolerated) rather than by bolus, to prevent sudden distention of the intestine.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Advise the patient to remain in semi-Fowler position for 1 hour after the feeding; this position prolongs intestinal transit time by decreasing the effect of gravity.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Instill the minimal amount of water needed to flush the tubing before and after a feeding, because fluid given with a feeding increases intestinal transit time.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who require long-term tube feedings may have had recent surgery, dysphagia due to a neuromuscular disease, head and neck cancer, radiation or other types of trauma to the throat, an obstruction of the upper GI tract, GI cancer and other malignancies, GI disease (including malabsorptive syndromes), or decreased level of consciousness. For a patient to be considered for tube feeding at home, the patient should:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Be medically stable and successfully tolerating at least 60% to 70% of the feeding regimen</span></li>
<li><span>Be capable of self-care or have a caregiver willing to assume the responsibility</span></li>
<li><span>Have access to supplies and interest in learning how to administer tube feedings at home</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Preparation of the patient for home administration of enteral feedings begins while the patient is still hospitalized. The nurse should educate the patient and caregiver while administering the feedings so that they can observe the mechanics and participate in the procedure, ask questions, and express any concerns. Before discharge, the nurse provides information about the equipment needed, formula purchase and storage, and administration of the feedings and water flushes (frequency, quantity, rate of instillation).</p>
<p class="indent">Family members who will be active in the patient&#x2019;s home care are encouraged to participate in education sessions. Available printed information about the equipment, the formula, and the procedure is reviewed. Arrangements are made to obtain the equipment and formula and have it ready for use before the patient&#x2019;s discharge.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Referral to home, community-based, or transitional care is important so that a nurse can supervise and provide support during the first tube feedings at home. Additional visits will depend on the skill and comfort of the patient or caregiver in administering the feedings. During all visits, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s physical status (weight, hydration status, vital signs, activity level) and the ability of the patient and family to administer the tube feedings correctly and assess the enteral access device and site. Enteral access devices require periodic replacement, and the nurse should be sure that the patient and caregiver have the necessary information to set up these tube replacement appointments. In addition, the nurse assesses for any complications. The patient or caregiver is encouraged to record times and amounts of feedings and water flushes, bowel patterns, and any symptoms that occur. The nurse can review the record with the patient and caregiver during home visits.</p>
