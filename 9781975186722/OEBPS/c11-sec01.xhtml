<h4 class="h4" id="s321">Overview of Shock</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Shock can best be defined as a clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion, creating an imbalance between the delivery of oxygen and nutrients needed to support cellular function (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib881">Kislitsina, Rich, Wilcox, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Massaro, 2018</a>). Adequate blood flow to the tissues and cells requires an effective cardiac pump, adequate vasculature or circulatory system, and sufficient blood volume. If one of these components is impaired, perfusion to the tissues is threatened or compromised. Without treatment, inadequate blood flow to the cells results in poor delivery of oxygen and nutrients, cellular hypoxia, and cell death that progresses to organ dysfunction and eventually death.</p>
<p class="indent">Shock affects all body systems. It may develop rapidly or slowly, depending on the underlying cause. During shock, the body struggles to survive, calling on all its homeostatic mechanisms to restore blood flow. Any insult to the body can create a cascade of events resulting in poor tissue perfusion. Therefore, any patient with any disease state may be at risk for developing shock. The primary underlying pathophysiologic process and underlying disorder are used to classify the shock state (e.g., hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock [see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>], distributive shock [i.e., septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic]; all discussed later in the chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the initial cause of shock, certain physiologic responses are common to all types of shock. These physiologic responses include hypoperfusion of tissues, hypermetabolism, and activation of the inflammatory response. The body responds to shock states by activating the sympathetic nervous system and mounting a hypermetabolic and inflammatory response. Failure of compensatory mechanisms to effectively restore physiologic balance is the final pathway of all shock states and results in end-organ dysfunction and death (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Massaro, 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care of patients with shock requires ongoing systematic assessment. Many of the interventions required in caring for patients with shock call for close collaboration with other members of the health care team and rapid implementation of prescribed therapies. Nurses are in key positions to identify early signs of shock and anticipate rapid therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s322">Normal Cellular Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Energy metabolism occurs within the cell, where nutrients are chemically broken down and stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Cells use this stored energy to perform necessary functions, such as active transport, muscle contraction, and biochemical synthesis, as well as specialized cellular functions, such as the conduction of electrical impulses. ATP can be synthesized aerobically (in the presence of oxygen) or anaerobically (in the absence of oxygen). Aerobic metabolism yields far greater amounts of ATP per mole of glucose than does anaerobic metabolism; therefore, it is a more efficient and effective means of producing energy. In addition, anaerobic metabolism results in the accumulation of the toxic end product lactic acid, which must be removed from the cell and transported to the liver for conversion into glucose and glycogen.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s323">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathophysiology of shock involves cellular changes, vascular responses, and changes in blood pressure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cellular Changes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In shock, the cells lack an adequate blood supply and are deprived of oxygen and nutrients; therefore, they must produce energy through anaerobic metabolism. This results in low-energy yields from nutrients and an acidotic intracellular environment. Because of these changes, normal cell function ceases (<a href="#ff11-1">Fig.&#x00A0;11-1</a>). The cell swells and the cell membrane becomes more permeable, allowing electrolytes and fluids to seep out of and into the cell. The sodium&#x2013;potassium pump becomes impaired; cell structures, primarily the mitochondria, are damaged, and death of the cell results.</p>
<p class="indent">Glucose is the primary substrate required for the production of cellular energy in the form of ATP. In stress states, catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon, and inflammatory <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytokines:&lt;/b&gt; messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)">cytokines</button></strong> (i.e., biochemical or inflammatory mediators) are released, causing hyperglycemia and insulin resistance to mobilize glucose for cellular metabolism. Activation of these substances promotes gluconeogenesis, which is the formation of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources such as proteins and fats. Glycogen that has been stored in the liver is converted to glucose through glycogenolysis to meet metabolic needs, increasing the blood glucose concentration (i.e., hyperglycemia).</p>
<p class="indent">Continued activation of the stress response by shock states causes a depletion of glycogen stores, resulting in increased proteolysis and eventual organ failure (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Massaro, 2018</a>). The deficit of nutrients and oxygen for normal cellular metabolism causes a buildup of metabolic end products in the cells and interstitial spaces. The clotting cascade, also associated with the inflammatory process, becomes activated, which compounds this pathologic cycle. With significant cell injury or death caused by shock, the clotting cascade is overproductive, resulting in small clots lodging in microcirculation, further hampering cellular perfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>). This upregulation of the clotting cascade further compromises microcirculation of tissues, exacerbating cellular hypoperfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>). Cellular metabolism is impaired, and a self-perpetuating negative situation (i.e., a positive feedback loop) is initiated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vascular Responses</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Local regulatory mechanisms, referred to as autoregulation, stimulate vasodilation or vasoconstriction in response to biochemical mediators released by the cell, communicating the need for oxygen and nutrients (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Kislitsina et al., 2019</a>). A cytokine is a substance released by a cell or immune cells such as macrophages; the substance triggers an action at a cell site <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page275" title="275"></span>or travels in the bloodstream to a distant site, where it triggers action. Researchers are learning more every day about the physiologic actions of numerous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory biochemical mediators that are responsible for the complex clinical presentation of shock states (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib873">Honore, Hoste, Moln&#x00E1;r, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Blood Pressure Regulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Three major components of the circulatory system&#x2014;blood volume, the cardiac pump, and the vasculature&#x2014;must respond effectively to complex neural, chemical, and hormonal feedback systems to maintain an adequate blood pressure (BP) and perfuse body tissues. BP is regulated through a complex interaction of neural, chemical, and hormonal feedback systems affecting both cardiac output and peripheral resistance. This relationship is expressed in the following equation:</p>
<p class="nonindent">Mean arterial BP = Cardiac output &#x00D7; Peripheral resistance</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiac output is a product of the stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle during systole) and heart rate. Peripheral resistance is primarily determined by the diameter of the arterioles.</p>
<p class="indent">Tissue perfusion and organ perfusion depend on mean arterial pressure (MAP), or the average pressure at which blood moves through the vasculature. MAP must exceed 65 mm Hg for cells to receive the oxygen and nutrients needed to metabolize energy in amounts sufficient to sustain life (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Hallisey &#x0026; Greenwood, 2019</a>). True MAP can be calculated only by complex methods; however, most digital BP machines provide a MAP reading to guide clinical decisions.</p>
<p class="indent">BP is regulated by baroreceptors (pressure receptors) located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. These pressure receptors are responsible for monitoring the circulatory volume and regulating neural and endocrine activities (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> for further description). When BP drops, catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine) are released from the adrenal medulla. These increase heart rate and cause vasoconstriction, restoring BP. Chemoreceptors, also located in the aortic arch and carotid arteries, regulate BP and respiratory rate using much the same mechanism in response to changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in the blood. These primary regulatory mechanisms can respond to changes in BP on a moment-to-moment basis.</p>
<p class="indent">The kidneys regulate BP by releasing renin, an enzyme needed for the eventual conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This stimulation of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin mechanism and the resulting vasoconstriction indirectly lead to the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which promotes the retention of sodium and water (i.e., hypernatremia). Hypernatremia then stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary gland. ADH causes the kidneys to retain water further in an effort to raise blood volume and BP. These secondary regulatory mechanisms may take hours or days to respond to changes in BP. The relationship between the initiation of shock and the responsiveness of primary and secondary regulatory mechanisms that compensate for deficits in blood volume, the pumping effectiveness of the heart, or vascular tone, which may result because of the shock state, is noted in <a href="c11-sec02.xhtml#ff11-2">Figure&#x00A0;11-2</a>.</p>
