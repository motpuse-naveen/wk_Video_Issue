<h4 class="h4" id="s3017">Meningitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges, which cover and protect the brain and spinal cord. The two main types of meningitis are bacterial and viral (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>). Meningitis can be the main reason a patient is hospitalized, or it can develop during hospitalization; it is classified as septic or aseptic. Septic meningitis is caused by bacteria. The bacteria <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> are responsible for 80% to 90% <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2089" title="2089"></span>of cases of bacterial meningitis in adults (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). In aseptic meningitis, the cause is viral or secondary to cancer or having a weakened immune system, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The most common causative agents are the enteroviruses (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>). Aseptic meningitis occurs more frequently in the summer and early fall.</p>
<p class="indent">First-year college students and members of the military who have not been vaccinated are at higher risk for meningococcal meningitis. Although infections occur year-round, the peak incidence is in the winter and early spring. Factors that increase the risk of bacterial meningitis include tobacco use and viral upper respiratory infection, because they increase the amount of droplet production. Otitis media and mastoiditis increase the risk of bacterial meningitis, because the bacteria can cross the epithelial membrane and enter the subarachnoid space. People with immune system deficiencies are also at greater risk for development of bacterial meningitis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3018">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Meningeal infections generally originate in one of two ways: through the bloodstream as a consequence of other infections or by direct spread, such as might occur after a traumatic injury to the facial bones or secondary to invasive procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the causative organism enters the bloodstream, it crosses the blood&#x2013;brain barrier and proliferates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The host immune response stimulates the release of cell wall fragments and lipopolysaccharides, facilitating inflammation of the subarachnoid and pia mater. Because the cranial vault contains little room for expansion, the inflammation may cause increased intracranial pressure (ICP). CSF circulates through the subarachnoid space, where inflammatory cellular materials from the affected meningeal tissue enter and accumulate.</p>
<p class="indent">The prognosis for bacterial meningitis depends on the causative organism, the severity of the infection and illness, and the timeliness of treatment. The <em>N. meningitidis</em> bacterium results in an acute fulminant presentation approximately 10% of the time. This presentation may include adrenal damage, circulatory collapse, and widespread hemorrhages (Waterhouse&#x2013;Friderichsen syndrome) (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). This syndrome is the result of endothelial damage and vascular necrosis caused by the bacteria.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3019">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Headache along with fever and chills are frequent initial symptoms. Fever tends to remain high throughout the course of the illness. The headache is usually either steady or throbbing and very severe as a result of meningeal irritation. Older adults may have mental status changes and focal neurologic deficits (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Mount &#x0026; Boyle, 2017</a>). Meningeal irritation results in a number of other well-recognized signs common to all types of meningitis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Neck immobility:</em> Nuchal rigidity (a stiff and painful neck) can be an early sign, and any attempts at flexion of the head are difficult because of spasms in the muscles of the neck. Usually, the neck is supple, and the patient can easily bend the head and neck forward.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Positive Kernig sign:</em> When the patient is lying with the thigh flexed on the abdomen, the leg cannot be completely extended (see <a href="#ff64-1">Fig.&#x00A0;64-1</a>A). When Kernig sign is bilateral, meningeal irritation is suspected.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Positive Brudzinski sign:</em> When the patient&#x2019;s neck is flexed (after ruling out cervical trauma or injury), flexion of the knees and hips is produced; when the lower extremity of one side is passively flexed, a similar movement is seen in the opposite extremity (see <a href="#ff64-1">Fig.&#x00A0;64-1</a>B). Brudzinski sign is a more sensitive indicator of meningeal irritation than Kernig sign.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Photophobia (extreme sensitivity to light):</em> This finding is common due to irritation of the meninges, especially around the diaphragm sellae.</span></li>
<li><span>A rash can be a striking feature of <em>meningococcal meningitidis</em> infection, occurring in about half of patients with this type of meningitis. Skin lesions develop, ranging from a petechial rash with purpuric lesions to large areas of ecchymosis.</span></li></ul>

Flex the patient&#x2019;s leg at both the hip and knee and then straighten the knee. <strong>B.</strong> Brudzinski sign. As the neck is flexed, watch the hips and knees for a reaction.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Disorientation and memory impairment are common early in the course of the illness. The changes depend on the severity of the infection as well as the individual response to the physiologic processes. Behavioral manifestations are also common. As the illness progresses, lethargy, unresponsiveness, and coma may develop.</p>
<p class="indent">Seizures can occur and are the result of areas of irritability in the brain. ICP increases secondary to diffuse brain swelling or hydrocephalus (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The initial signs of increased ICP include decreased level of consciousness (LOC) and focal motor deficits. If ICP is not controlled, the uncus of the temporal lobe may herniate through the tentorium, causing pressure on the brainstem. Brainstem herniation is a life-threatening event that causes cranial nerve dysfunction and depresses the centers of vital functions, such as the medulla. See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for discussion of the patient with a change in LOC or increased ICP.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2089</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2090" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2090">p. 2090</span></div>
<p class="indent">An acute fulminant infection produces signs of sepsis: an abrupt onset of high fever, extensive purpuric lesions (over the face and extremities), shock, and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>). Death may occur within a few hours after onset of the infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3020">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the clinical presentation suggests meningitis, diagnostic testing is conducted to identify the causative organism. A computed tomography (CT) scan is used to detect a shift in brain contents (which may lead to herniation) prior to a lumbar puncture in patient with altered LOC, papilledema, neurologic deficits, new onset of seizure, immunocompromised state, or history of central nervous system (CNS) disease. Bacterial culture and Gram staining of CSF and blood are key diagnostic tests (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). An overview of CSF values and alterations in bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis is presented in <a href="#tt64-1">Table&#x00A0;64-1</a>. Gram staining allows for rapid identification of the causative bacteria and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3021">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the meningococcal conjugated vaccine be given to youth at 11 to 12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years of age (CDC, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">People in close contact with patients with meningococcal meningitis should be treated with antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis using rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone. Therapy should be started within 24 hours after exposure because a delay limits the effectiveness of the prophylaxis. Vaccination should also be considered as an adjunct to antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for anyone living with a person who develops meningococcal infection. Vaccination against <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> and <em>S. pneumoniae</em> should be encouraged for children and adults who are at-risk (CDC, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3022">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Successful outcomes depend on the early administration of an antibiotic agent that crosses the blood&#x2013;brain barrier into the subarachnoid space in sufficient concentration to halt the multiplication of bacteria. Penicillin G in combination with one of the cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) is most often administered intravenously (IV), emergently with suspected bacterial meningitis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dexamethasone has been shown to be beneficial as adjunct therapy in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis and in pneumococcal meningitis if it is given before or concurrently with the first dose of antibiotic and every 6 hours for the next 4 days. Research suggests that dexamethasone improves the outcome in adults and does not increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dehydration and shock are treated with fluid volume expanders. Seizures, which may occur early in the course of the disease, are treated with anticonvulsant medications. Increased ICP is treated as necessary (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3023"><img src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with meningitis is critically ill; therefore, many of the nursing interventions are collaborative with the physician, respiratory therapist, and other members of the health care team. The patient&#x2019;s safety and well-being depend on sound nursing judgment. Most patients will need the following nursing interventions:</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Instituting infection control precautions until 24 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy (oral and nasal discharge is considered infectious)</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Assisting with pain management due to overall body aches and neck pain</span></li>
<li><span>Assisting with getting rest in a quiet, darkened room</span></li>
<li><span>Implementing interventions to treat the elevated temperature, such as antipyretic agents and cooling blankets</span></li>
<li><span>Encouraging the patient to stay hydrated either orally or peripherally</span></li>
<li><span>Ensuring close neurologic monitoring (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Neurologic status and vital signs are continually assessed. Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas values are used to quickly identify the need for respiratory support if increasing ICP compromises the brainstem. Insertion of a cuffed endotracheal tube (or tracheotomy) and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation.</p>
<p class="indent">Blood pressure (usually monitored using an arterial line) is assessed for early manifestations of shock, which precedes cardiac or respiratory failure. Rapid IV fluid replacement may be prescribed, but care is taken to prevent fluid overload. Fever also increases the workload of the heart and cerebral metabolism. ICP will increase in response to increased cerebral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2091" title="2091"></span>metabolic demands. Therefore, measures are taken to reduce body temperature as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">Other important components of nursing care include the following measures:</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Protecting the patient from injury secondary to seizure activity or altered LOC</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Monitoring daily body weight; serum electrolytes; and urine volume, specific gravity, and osmolality, especially if syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is suspected</span></li>
<li><span>Preventing complications associated with immobility, such as pressure injury and pneumonia</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Any sudden, critical illness can be devastating to the family. Because the patient&#x2019;s condition is often critical and the prognosis guarded, the family needs to be informed about the patient&#x2019;s condition. Periodic family visits are essential to facilitate coping of the patient and family. An important aspect of the nurse&#x2019;s role is to support the family and assist them in identifying others who can be supportive to them during the crisis (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the patient has achieved physiologic homeostasis and has demonstrated achievement of major health care goals, rehabilitation continues either in a rehabilitation facility, skilled nursing facility, or at home. Continued support and evaluation by the nurse are essential.</p>
<p class="indent">Because patients may have been critically ill and focused on the most obvious needs and issues, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices, such as regular physical examinations and appropriate diagnostic screening tests.</p>
