<h4 class="h4" id="s2305">Abortion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Interruption of pregnancy or expulsion of the product of conception before the fetus is viable is called <em>abortion.</em> The fetus is generally considered to be viable any time after the fifth to sixth month of gestation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2306">Spontaneous Abortion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is estimated that 1 of every 5 to 10 conceptions ends in spontaneous abortion. Most of these occur because an abnormality in the fetus makes survival impossible. Other causes may include systemic diseases, hormonal imbalance, or anatomic abnormalities. If a woman who is pregnant experiences bleeding and cramping, a threatened abortion is diagnosed because an actual abortion is usually imminent. Spontaneous abortion occurs most commonly in the second or third month of gestation.</p>
<p class="indent">There are various types of spontaneous abortion, depending on the nature of the process (threatened, inevitable, incomplete, or complete). In a threatened abortion, the cervix does not dilate. With bed rest and conservative treatment, the abortion may be prevented. If not, an abortion is imminent. If only some of the tissue is passed, the abortion is referred to as incomplete. An emptying or evacuation procedure (D&#x0026;C, or dilation and evacuation [D&#x0026;E]) or administration of oral misoprostol is usually required to remove the remaining tissue. If the fetus and all related tissue are spontaneously evacuated, the abortion is termed <em>complete,</em> and no further treatment is required.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2307">Habitual Abortion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Habitual or recurrent abortion is defined as successive, repeated, spontaneous abortions of unknown cause. As many as 60% of abortions may result from chromosomal anomalies (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). After two consecutive abortions, the patient is referred for genetic counseling and testing, and other possible causes are explored.</p>
<p class="indent">If bleeding occurs in a woman who is pregnant with a past history of habitual abortion, conservative measures, such as bed rest and administration of progesterone to support the endometrium, are attempted to save the pregnancy. Supportive counseling is crucial in this stressful condition. Bed rest, sexual abstinence, a light diet, and no straining on defecation may be recommended in an effort to prevent spontaneous abortion. If infection is suspected, antibiotic agents may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">In the condition known as incompetent or dysfunctional cervix, the cervix dilates painlessly in the second trimester of pregnancy, often resulting in a spontaneous abortion. In such cases, a surgical procedure called <em>cervical cerclage</em> may be used to prevent the cervix from dilating prematurely. It involves placing a purse-string suture around the cervix at the level of the internal os (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Bed rest is usually advised to keep the weight of the uterus off the cervix. About 2 to 3 weeks before term or at the onset of labor, the suture is cut. Delivery is usually by cesarean section.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2308">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After a spontaneous abortion, all tissue passed vaginally is saved for examination, if possible. The patient and all personnel who care for her are alerted to save any discharged material. In the rare case of heavy bleeding, the patient may require blood component transfusions and fluid replacement. An estimate of the bleeding volume can be determined by recording the number of perineal pads and the degree of saturation over 24 hours. When an incomplete abortion occurs, oxytocin may be prescribed to cause uterine contractions before D&#x0026;E or uterine suctioning.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2309">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because patients experience loss and anxiety, emotional support and understanding are important aspects of nursing care. Women may be grieving or relieved, depending on their feelings about the pregnancy. Providing opportunities for the patient to talk and express her emotions is helpful and also provides clues for the nurse in planning more specific care.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2310">Induced Abortion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A voluntary induced termination of pregnancy is performed by skilled health care providers. Decisions about abortion reside with a woman and her primary provider in the first trimester. During the second trimester, the state may regulate practice in the interest of a woman&#x2019;s health and during the final weeks of pregnancy may choose to protect the life of the fetus, except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.</p>
<p class="indent">In the United States, 42% of all unintended pregnancies were terminated by abortion (Allan Guttmacher Institute, 2018). These numbers indicate the need for effective contraceptive education, information about emergency contraception, and counseling.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Types of Induced Abortions</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Vacuum Aspiration</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The cervix is dilated manually with instrumentation or by laminaria (small suppositories made of seaweed that swells as it absorbs water).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A uterine aspirator is introduced.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Suction is applied, and tissue is removed from the uterus.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This is the most common type of termination procedure and is used early in pregnancy, up to 14 weeks. Laminaria may be used to soften and dilate the cervix prior to the procedure.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Dilation and Evacuation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Cervical dilation with laminaria followed by vacuum aspiration</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Labor Induction</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">These procedures account for fewer than 1% of all terminations and generally take place in an inpatient setting.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>Installation of normal saline or urea results in uterine contractions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Although rare, serious complications can occur, including cardiovascular collapse, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, kidney disease, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>Prostaglandins</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Prostaglandins are introduced into the amniotic fluid or by vaginal suppository or intramuscular injection in later pregnancy.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Strong uterine contractions begin within 4 hours and usually result in abortion.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping) and fever can occur.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>IV oxytocin</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Used for later abortions for genetic indications. Requires patient to go through labor.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Medical Abortion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Mifepristone</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist that prevents implantation of the ovum.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Given orally within 10 days of an expected menstrual period, mifepristone produces a medical abortion in most patients.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Combined with a prostaglandin suppository, mifepristone causes abortion in up to 95% of patients.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Prolonged bleeding may occur. Other side effects may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This method may not be used in women with adrenal failure, asthma, long-term corticosteroid therapy, an intrauterine device in place, porphyria, or a history of allergy to mifepristone or other prostaglandins. It is less effective when used in pregnancies more than 49 days from the beginning of the last menstrual period.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Methotrexate</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Methotrexate has also been used to terminate pregnancy because it is lethal to the fetus. It has been found to have minimal risk and few side effects in the woman. Its low cost may provide an alternative for some women.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Misoprostol</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin analog that produces cervical effacement and uterine contractions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inserted vaginally, misoprostol is effective in terminating a pregnancy in about 75% of cases.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When combined with methotrexate or mifepristone, misoprostol&#x2019;s effectiveness rate is high.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2311">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Before the abortion procedure is performed (see <a href="#ct50-10">Chart&#x00A0;50-10</a>), a nurse or counselor trained in pregnancy counseling should talk with the patient and explore her fears, feelings, and options. The nurse then identifies the patient&#x2019;s choice (i.e., continuing pregnancy and parenthood, continuing pregnancy followed by adoption, or terminating pregnancy by abortion). If abortion is chosen, the patient has a pelvic examination to determine uterine size. A pelvic ultrasound may also be performed. Laboratory studies before an abortion must include a pregnancy test to confirm the pregnancy, hematocrit to rule out anemia, and Rh determination. Patients with anemia will require an iron supplement, and patients who are Rh negative may require Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) to prevent isoimmunization. Before the procedure, all patients should be screened for STIs to prevent introducing pathogens upward through the cervix during the procedure.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Women who have resorted to unskilled attempts to end a pregnancy may become critically ill because of infection, hemorrhage, or uterine rupture. If a woman has undergone such efforts to end a pregnancy, prompt medical attention, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and replacement of fluids and blood components may be required before careful attempts are made to evacuate the uterus.</em></p></div>

<p class="indent">Surgical terminations include D&#x0026;C or vacuum aspiration of uterine contents. Medications can also be used. Mifepristone is used only in early pregnancy (up to 49 days from the last menstrual period). It works by blocking progesterone. Cramping and bleeding similar to a heavy menstrual period occur. After counseling and consent and often a sonogram to confirm the pregnancy, mifepristone is given. This is followed by a dose of misoprostol orally or vaginally. If the pregnancy persists, a suction aspiration is performed. Contraindications include ectopic pregnancy, adrenal failure, allergy to the medications, bleeding disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, or uncontrolled seizure disorders. Several deaths from sepsis have occurred following medical abortion; researchers and the FDA are closely monitoring the morbidity and mortality associated with medical abortion. Medical and surgical abortions used in the first trimester are both highly effective with low complication rates (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Bartz &#x0026; Blumenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2312">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education is an important aspect of care for women who elect to terminate a pregnancy. A patient undergoing induced abortion is informed about what the procedure entails and the expected course after the procedure. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after the procedure and is instructed about signs and symptoms (i.e., fever, heavy bleeding, or pain) that should be reported.</p>
<p class="indent">Available contraceptive methods are reviewed with the patient. Effectiveness depends on the method used and the extent to which the woman and her partner follow the instructions for use. A woman who has used any method of birth control should be assessed for her understanding of the method and its potential side effects as well as her satisfaction with the method. If the woman has not been using contraception, the nurse explains all methods and their benefits and risks and helps the patient make a contraceptive choice for use after abortion. Related education issues, such as the need to use barrier contraceptive devices (i.e., condoms) for protection against transmission of STIs and HIV infection and the availability of emergency contraception, are also important.</p>
<p class="indent">Psychological support is another important aspect of nursing care. The nurse needs to be aware that women terminate pregnancies for many reasons. Some women terminate pregnancies because of severe genetic defects. Women who have been raped or impregnated in incestuous relationships or by an abusive partner may elect to terminate their pregnancies. The care of a woman undergoing termination of pregnancy is stressful, and assistance needs to be provided in a safe and nonjudgmental way. Nurses have the right to refuse to participate in a procedure that is against their religious beliefs but are professionally obligated not to impose their beliefs or judgments on their patients.</p>
