<h4 class="h4" id="s2376">Vulvar Dystrophy</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vulvar dystrophy:&lt;/b&gt; thickening or lesions of the vulva; usually causes itching and may require biopsy to exclude malignancy">Vulvar dystrophy</button></strong> is a condition found in older women that causes dry, thickened skin on the vulva or slightly raised, whitish papules, fissures, or macules. Symptoms usually consist of varying degrees of itching, but some patients have no symptoms. A few patients with vulvar cancer have associated dystrophy (vulvar cancer is discussed later in this chapter). Biopsy with careful follow-up is the standard intervention. Benign dystrophies include lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, lichen sclerosus (benign disorder of the vulva), squamous cell hyperplasia, vulvar <strong>vestibulitis</strong> (inflammation of the vulvar vestibule), and other dermatoses (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Chibnall, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2377">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Topical corticosteroids (i.e., hydrocortisone creams) are the usual treatment. Petrolatum jelly may relieve pruritus. Use is decreased as symptoms resolve. Topical corticosteroids are effective in treating squamous cell hyperplasia. Treatment is often complete in 2 to 3 weeks, but ongoing assessment for vulvar atrophy should occur at least annually (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Chibnall, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If malignant cells are detected on biopsy, local excision, laser therapy, local chemotherapy, and immunologic treatment are used. Vulvectomy is avoided, if possible, to spare the patient from the stress of disfigurement and possible sexual dysfunction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2378">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Key nursing responsibilities for patients with vulvar dystrophies focus on education. Important topics include hygiene and self-monitoring for signs and symptoms of complications.</p>

<p class="h7a"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Education for patients with benign vulvar dystrophies includes the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene and keeping the vulva dry. Lanolin or hydrogenated vegetable oil is recommended for relief of dryness. Sitz baths may help but should not be overused because dryness may result or increase. The patient is instructed to notify the primary provider about any change or ulceration because biopsy may be necessary to rule out squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

<p class="indent">By encouraging all patients to perform genital self-examinations regularly and have any itching, lesions, or unusual symptoms assessed by a primary provider, nurses can help prevent complications and progression of vulvar lesions. Ongoing assessment should occur at least annually.</p>
