<h4 class="h4" id="s56">Health History</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The health history is a series of questions used to provide an overview of the patient&#x2019;s current health status. Many nurses are responsible for obtaining a detailed history of the patient&#x2019;s current health problems, past health history and family history, and a review of the patient&#x2019;s functional status. This results in a total health profile that focuses on lifestyle and health, as well as on illness.</p>
<p class="indent">While obtaining the health history, attention is focused on the impact of psychosocial and cultural background and ethnicity on a patient&#x2019;s health, illnesses, and health promotion behaviors. The interpersonal and physical environments, as well as the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle and activities of daily living, are explored in depth.</p>
<p class="indent">The format of the health history traditionally combines the medical history and the nursing assessment. Both the review of systems and the patient profile are expanded to include individual and family relationships, lifestyle patterns, health practices and nutritional assessment, and coping strategies. These components of the health history are the basis of nursing assessment and can be easily adapted to address the needs of any patient population in any setting, institution, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page74" title="74"></span>or agency (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley, Palm, &#x0026; Bickley, 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The health history format discussed in this chapter is only one approach that is useful in obtaining and organizing information about a patient&#x2019;s health status. Some experts consider this traditional format to be inappropriate for nurses, because it does not focus exclusively on the assessment of human responses to actual or potential health problems. Several attempts have been made to develop an assessment format and database with this focus in mind. One example is a nursing database developed by NANDA International and its 13 domains: health promotion, nutrition, elimination and exchange, activity/rest, perception/cognition, self-perception, role relationships, sexuality, coping/stress tolerance, life principles, safety/protection, comfort, and growth/development (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Ackley et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-6">Chart&#x00A0;1-6</a> for further details). Although there is support in nursing for using this approach, no consensus for its use has been reached.</p>
<p class="indent">The National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) and other groups from the public and private sectors have focused on assessing not only biologic health but also other dimensions of health. These dimensions include physical, functional, emotional, mental, and social health. Efforts to assess health status have focused on the manner in which disease or disability affects a patient&#x2019;s functional status&#x2014;that is, the ability of patients to function normally and perform their usual physical, mental, and social activities. An emphasis on functional assessment is viewed as more holistic than the traditional medical history. Instruments to assess health status in these ways may be used by nurses along with their own clinical assessment skills to determine the impact of illness, disease, disability, and health problems on functional status (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the assessment format used, the focus of nurses during data collection is different from that of primary providers and other health care team members. Combining the information obtained by the primary provider and the nurse into one health history prevents duplication of information and minimizes efforts on the part of the patient to provide this information repeatedly. This also encourages collaboration among members of the health care team who share in the collection and interpretation of the data.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s57">The Informant</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The informant, or the person providing the health history, may not always be the patient, as in the case of a patient with a developmental or cognitive disability or those who are disoriented, confused, unconscious, or comatose. The interviewer should assess the reliability of the informant and the usefulness of the information provided. For example, a patient who is disoriented is often unable to provide reliable information; people who use alcohol and illicit drugs often deny using these substances. The interviewer must make a clinical judgment about the reliability of the information (based on the context of the entire interview) and include this assessment in the record. <a href="#ct4-1">Chart&#x00A0;4-1</a> provides special considerations for obtaining a health history from an older adult.</p>

<div class="box7"><p class="Box7pTitle"><strong>Health Assessment in the Older Adult</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain the health history from older adult patients in a calm, unrushed manner.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Consider possible vision or hearing impairments. Ensure that lighting is adequate but not glaring, and keep distracting noises to a minimum.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assume a position that enables the older adult patient to read lips and facial expressions. Sometimes sitting at a 90-degree angle to the patient is helpful because some visual impairments, such as macular degeneration, can limit the patient&#x2019;s vision to only peripheral vision. It is best to ask the patient where the interviewer should sit in relation to the patient to optimize the patient&#x2019;s view of the interviewer.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Determine if the patient uses a hearing aid and ask the patient to use it during the interview. Check if the patient usually wears glasses and ensure that they are worn as well.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that older adults often assume that new physical problems are a result of age rather than a treatable illness. Some of these problems may limit their activities of daily living and lifestyle patterns.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ask questions related to changes in the level of functioning. The signs and symptoms of illness in older adults are often more subtle than those in younger adults and may go unreported. A question such as &#x201C;What interferes most in your daily activities?&#x201D; may be useful in focusing the clinical evaluation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain a complete history of medications used, because many older adult patients take many different kinds of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Consider including a member of the family in the interview process. Although older adults may experience a decline in mental function, it should not be assumed that they are unable to provide an adequate history. Including a spouse, adult child, sibling, or caretaker may validate information and provide missing details. However, this should be done after obtaining the patient&#x2019;s permission (further details about assessment of the older adult are provided in <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s58">Components of the Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When a patient is seen for the first time by a member of the health care team, the first requirement is that baseline information be obtained (except in emergency situations). The sequence and format of obtaining data about a patient may vary; however, the content, regardless of format, usually addresses the same general topics. A traditional health history includes the following: biographical data, chief complaint, present health concern (or history of present illness), past health history, family history, review of systems, and patient profile.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Biographical Data</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Biographical information puts the patient&#x2019;s health history into context. This information includes the person&#x2019;s name, address, age, gender, marital status, occupation, and ethnic origins. Some interviewers prefer to ask more personal questions at this part of the interview, whereas others wait until more trust and confidence have been established or until a patient&#x2019;s immediate or urgent needs are first addressed. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page75" title="75"></span>A patient who is in severe pain or has another urgent problem is unlikely to have a great deal of patience for an interviewer who is more concerned about marital or occupational status than with quickly addressing the problem at hand.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chief Complaint</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The chief complaint is the issue that caused the patient to seek the care of the health care provider. Questions such as &#x201C;Why have you come to the health center today?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Why were you admitted to the hospital?&#x201D; usually elicit the chief complaint. However, a statement such as &#x201C;My doctor sent me&#x201D; should be followed up with questions that identify and clarify the chief complaint (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). In the home setting, the initial question might be, &#x201C;What is bothering you most today?&#x201D; When a problem is identified, the person&#x2019;s exact words are usually recorded in quotation marks. Sometimes patients have no specific complaints. The nurse should report their goals instead. For example, patients might report that &#x201C;I have come for my regular checkup&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been admitted for a thorough evaluation of my heart&#x201D; (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Present Health Concern or Illness</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The history of the present health concern or illness is the single most important factor in helping the health care team arrive at a diagnosis or determine the patient&#x2019;s current needs. The physical examination is also helpful and often validates the information obtained from the history. A careful history and physical examination assist in the correct selection of appropriate diagnostic tests. Although diagnostic test results can be helpful, they often support rather than establish the diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">If the present illness is only one episode in a series of episodes, the nurse records the entire sequence of events. For example, a history from a patient whose chief complaint is an episode of chest pain should describe the entire course of their disease to put the current episode into context. The history of the present illness or problem includes information such as the date and type of onset (sudden or gradual) in which the problem occurred, the setting in which the problem occurred (at home, at work, after an argument, after exercise), manifestations of the problem, and the course of the illness or problem. This should include self-treatment (including complementary and alternative therapies), medical interventions, progress and effects of treatment, and the patient&#x2019;s perceptions of the cause or meaning of the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Specific symptoms such as headaches, fever, or changes in bowel habits are described in detail. The interviewer should also ask whether the symptom is persistent or intermittent, what factors aggravate or alleviate it, and whether any associated manifestations exist. If the patient complains of pain, the location, quality, severity, and duration of the pain are determined (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for a more detailed discussion of pain).</p>
<p class="indent">Associated manifestations are symptoms that occur simultaneously with the chief complaint. The presence or absence of such symptoms may help determine the origin or extent of the problem, as well as the diagnosis. These symptoms are referred to as significant positive or negative findings and are obtained from a review of systems directly related to the chief complaint. For example, if a patient reports a vague symptom such as fatigue or weight loss, all body systems are reviewed. On the contrary, if a patient&#x2019;s chief complaint is something specific, such as chest pain, then the cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal systems will be the focus of the history of the present illness. In either situation, both positive and negative findings are recorded to further define the issue.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A detailed summary of a patient&#x2019;s past health is an important part of the health history. After determining the patient&#x2019;s general health status, the interviewer should inquire about immunization status and compare it with the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib232">Ezeanolue, Harriman, Hunter, et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="c03-sec05.xhtml#tt3-3">Table&#x00A0;3-3</a> for an adult immunization schedule) and then record the dates of immunization (if known). The interviewer should also inquire about any known allergies to medications or other substances, along with the nature of the allergy and associated adverse reactions. Other relevant material includes information, if known, about the patient&#x2019;s last physical examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, eye examination, hearing test, dental checkup, Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and mammogram (if female), digital rectal examination of the prostate gland (if male), bone density testing, colon cancer screening, and any other pertinent tests.</p>
<p class="indent">The interviewer discusses previous illnesses and records negative as well as positive responses to a list of specific diseases. The dates of illnesses, or the age of the patient at the time, as well as the names of the primary providers and hospitals, the diagnoses, and the treatments, are noted. The interviewer elicits a history of the following areas:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Childhood illnesses&#x2014;rubeola, rubella, polio, whooping cough, mumps, measles, chickenpox, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, strep throat</span></li>
<li><span>Adult illnesses</span></li>
<li><span>Psychiatric illnesses</span></li>
<li><span>Injuries&#x2014;burns, fractures, head injuries, traumatic injuries</span></li>
<li><span>Hospitalizations</span></li>
<li><span>Surgical and diagnostic procedures</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">If a particular hospitalization or major medical intervention is related to the present illness, the account of it is not repeated here; rather, the report refers to the appropriate part of the record, such as (see present health concern or illness) on the patient&#x2019;s health record.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Family History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To identify diseases that may be genetic, communicable, or possibly environmental in origin, the interviewer asks about the age and health status, or the age and cause of death, of first-order relatives (parents, siblings, spouse, children) and second-order relatives (grandparents, cousins). The nurse records the age and health, or age and cause of death, of each relative. In addition, each of the following conditions should be reviewed with the patient to determine whether they are present or absent among family members<em>:</em> hypertension, coronary artery disease, elevated cholesterol levels, stroke, diabetes, thyroid or renal disease, arthritis, tuberculosis, asthma or lung disease, headache, seizure disorder, mental illness, substance use disorder, cancer and the site or type, genetic diseases, and allergies; the nurse should also determine if there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page76" title="76"></span>is a family history of suicide (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>). One of the easiest methods of recording such data is by using the family tree, genogram, or pedigree (<a href="#ff4-2">Fig.&#x00A0;4-2</a>). The results of genetic testing or screening, if known, are recorded. <a href="#ct4-2">Chart&#x00A0;4-2</a> provides genetic considerations related to health assessment (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for a detailed discussion of genetics).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Review of Systems</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The review of systems includes an overview of general health as well as symptoms related to each body system. Questions are asked about each of the major body systems for information about past and present symptoms. Negative and positive answers should be recorded. If a patient responds positively to questions about a particular system, the information is analyzed carefully. If any illnesses were previously mentioned or recorded, it is not necessary to repeat them in this part of the history.</p>
<p class="indent">A review of systems can be organized in a formal checklist, which becomes part of the health history. One advantage of a checklist is that it can be easily audited and is less subject to error than a system that relies heavily on the interviewer&#x2019;s memory.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Patient Profile</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the patient profile, more biographical information is gathered. A complete composite, or profile, of the patient is critical to the analysis of the chief complaint and of the patient&#x2019;s ability to deal with the problem. A complete patient profile is summarized in <a href="#ct4-3">Chart&#x00A0;4-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point in the interview, the information elicited is highly personal and subjective. People are encouraged to express feelings honestly and to discuss significant health events. It is best to begin with general, open-ended questions and to move to direct questioning when specific facts are needed. Interviews that progress from information that is less personal (birthplace, occupation, education) to information that is more personal (sexuality, body image, coping abilities) often reduce anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">A general patient profile consists of the following content areas: past life events related to health; current medications; complementary, alternative and integrative health therapies; education and occupation; financial resources; environment (physical, spiritual, interpersonal); lifestyle patterns; presence of a physical or mental disability; self-concept; sexuality; risk for abuse or intimate partner violence (IPV); and stress and coping response.</p>
<p class="h7">Past Life Events Related to Health</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient profile begins with a brief life history. Questions about place of birth and past places of residence help focus attention on the earlier years of life. Personal experiences during childhood or adolescence that have special significance may be elicited by asking a question such as, &#x201C;Were there any events that occurred when you were a child or adolescent that would be helpful for me to know about?&#x201D; The interviewer&#x2019;s intent is to encourage the patient to make a quick review of their earlier life, highlighting information of particular significance. Although many patients may not recall anything significant, others may share information such as a personal achievement, a failure, a developmental crisis, or an instance of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The life history should include a brief medication history as appropriate for the patient.</p>
<p class="h7">Current Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">A review of the patient&#x2019;s current medications is necessary to complete a comprehensive health history. Particular attention is given to allergies or adverse reactions to medications. The interviewer should inquire about the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications and herbal supplements and complementary therapies (see next section); patients often include only prescription medications when they list their current medications.</p>
<p class="indent">When gathering information on use of current medications, the nurse must also consider the physiologic impact of ethnicity and culture on patients&#x2019; response to medications. Data have been collected for many years regarding differences in the effect that some medications have on people of diverse ethnic or cultural origins. Genetic predispositions to different rates of metabolism cause some patients to be prone to adverse reactions to the standard dose of a medication, whereas other patients are likely to experience a greatly reduced benefit from the standard dose of the medication (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>). For example, an antihypertensive agent may work well at reducing blood pressure to acceptable levels for a Caucasian man within a 4-week time span, but may take much longer to work or not work at all for an African American man with hypertension. In the future, genomic research may capitalize on the work of transdisciplinary teams that are building the skills needed to design and assess multilevel interventions aimed at improving the health of minorities and reducing health disparities (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib219">Agurs-Collins, Persky, Paskett, et al., 2019</a>). Nurses <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page77" title="77"></span>must be aware that ethnicity and related factors such as values and beliefs regarding the use of herbal supplements, dietary intake, and genetic factors can affect the effectiveness of treatment and adherence to the prescribed medication regimen (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Health Therapies</p>
<p class="nonindent">Interventions for alterations in health and wellness vary among cultures. Interventions most commonly used in the United States have been labeled as <em>conventional medicine,</em> which is also variously referred to as allopathy, Western medicine, regular medicine, mainstream medicine, and biomedicine (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health [NCCIH], 2019</a>). Therapy used to supplement conventional medicine is referred to as <em>complementary therapy,</em> whereas therapy used to replace conventional medicine is referred to as <em>alternative therapy</em> (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">NCCIH, 2019</a>). Interest in interventions that are not an integral part of conventional medicine prompted the National Institutes of Health to create the Office of Alternative Medicine and then to establish the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which is now called the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">NCCIH, 2019</a>). Integrative health care is viewed as a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to preventing and treating illness and promoting health that brings together complementary, alternative, and conventional therapies. The use of an integrative approach to health and wellness has grown within mainstream health care settings in the United States (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">NCCIH, 2019</a>). More than 30% of adults use health care approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice. Most people who use nonmainstream approaches also use conventional health care (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">NCCIH, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Integrative health therapies are classified by product or practice type into two subgroups&#x2014;natural products or mind and body practices (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">NCCIH, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Natural products</em> include herbs (also known as botanicals), vitamins and minerals, and probiotics. These are widely marketed to consumers and often sold and used as dietary supplements.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Mind and body practices</em> include large and diverse procedures and techniques given or taught by trained practitioners or teachers and include practices such as yoga, meditation, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, massage therapy, acupuncture, relaxation techniques, and T&#x2019;ai chi.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patients may choose to seek a complementary or alternative approach to conventional medical or surgical therapies. Nurses must assess all patients for the use of complementary therapies, be alert to the danger of natural product&#x2013;drug interactions or conflicting treatments, and be prepared to provide information to patients about treatments that may be harmful <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page78" title="78"></span>or helpful, based upon best evidence from research findings. However, nurses must be accepting of patients&#x2019; beliefs and right to autonomy&#x2014;that is, to control their own care. As patient advocates, nurses facilitate the integration of conventional medical, complementary, and alternative therapies.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Education and Occupation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Inquiring about a patient&#x2019;s current occupation can reveal much about their economic status and educational preparation. A statement such as &#x201C;Tell me about your job&#x201D; often elicits information about role, job tasks, and satisfaction with the position. Direct questions about past employment and career goals may be asked if the person does not provide this information.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to learn about a patient&#x2019;s educational background. Asking what kind of educational requirements were necessary for a patient to attain their present job is a more sensitive approach than asking whether they graduated from high school.</p>
<p class="h7">Financial Resources</p>
<p class="nonindent">Information about the patient&#x2019;s general financial status may be obtained by asking questions such as &#x201C;Do you have any financial concerns at this time?&#x201D; Inquiries about the person&#x2019;s insurance coverage and plans for health care payment are also appropriate.</p>
<p class="h7">Environment</p>
<p class="nonindent">The concept of environment includes a person&#x2019;s physical environment and its potential hazards. It also includes a person&#x2019;s spiritual awareness, ethnicity, and support systems.</p>
<p class="h8">Physical Environment</p>
<p class="nonindent">Information is elicited about the type of housing (e.g., apartment, duplex, single family) in which the person lives, its location, the level of safety and comfort within the home and neighborhood, and the presence of environmental hazards (e.g., social isolation, potential fire risks, inadequate sanitation). If the patient is homeless, details about available resources are important to ascertain.</p>
<p class="h8">Spiritual Environment</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spirituality:&lt;/b&gt; connectedness with self, others, a life force, or God that allows people to find meaning in life">Spirituality</button></strong> is defined as connectedness with self, others, a life force, or God that allows people to experience self-transcendence and find meaning in life. Spirituality helps <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page79" title="79"></span>many people discover a purpose in life, understand the ever-changing qualities of life, and develop their relationship with God or a higher power. Spirituality in nursing practice includes concerns with the personal spiritual and religious needs of the patient and nurse, as well as the spiritual dimension of the nurse&#x2013;patient interaction (O&#x2019;Brien, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Spiritual behavior can be expressed through devotion, sacrifice, self-discipline, and spending time in activities that focus on the inner self or the soul. Although religion and nature are two vehicles that people use to connect themselves with God or a higher power, bonds to religious institutions, beliefs, or dogma are not required to experience the spiritual sense of self. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;faith:&lt;/b&gt; trust in God, belief in a higher power or something that a person cannot see">Faith</button></strong>, considered the foundation of spirituality, is trust in God and belief in a higher power or something that a person cannot see. The spiritual part of a person views life as a mystery that unfolds over one&#x2019;s lifetime, encompassing questions about meaning, hope, relatedness to a higher power, acceptance or forgiveness, and transcendence.</p>
<p class="indent">A person&#x2019;s spiritual environment refers to the degree to which they think about or contemplate existence, accept challenges in life, and seek and find answers to personal questions. Spirituality may be expressed through identification with a particular religion. Spiritual values and beliefs often direct a person&#x2019;s behavior and approach to health problems and can influence responses to sickness. A strong sense of spirituality or religious faith can have a positive impact on health. Spirituality is also a component of hope, and, especially during chronic, serious, or terminal illness, patients and their families often find comfort and emotional strength in their religious traditions or spiritual beliefs. At other times, illness and loss can cause a loss of faith or meaning in life and a spiritual crisis, which can place considerable stress on a person&#x2019;s internal resources and beliefs. It is important that the spiritual beliefs of people and families be acknowledged, valued, and respected for the comfort and guidance they provide. Inquiring about spirituality can identify possible support systems as well as beliefs and customs that need to be considered in planning care. Information is gathered about the extent to which religion is a part of the person&#x2019;s life as well as religious beliefs and practices related to health and illness.</p>
<p class="indent">A spiritual assessment may involve asking the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Is religion or spirituality important to you?</span></li>
<li><span>If no, what is the most important thing in your life?</span></li>
<li><span>If yes, in what way? For instance:</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any religious or spiritual practices that are important to you?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you belong to a faith community or have a place of worship?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you have any religious or spiritual concerns because of your present health problem?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The nurse should assess spiritual strength further by inquiring about the patient&#x2019;s sense of spiritual well-being, hope, and peacefulness. It is also necessary to assess whether spiritual beliefs and values have changed in response to illness or loss. The nurse assesses current and past participation in religious or spiritual practices and notes the patient&#x2019;s responses to questions regarding spiritual needs to help determine the patient&#x2019;s need for spiritual care. Another simple assessment technique is to inquire about the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s desire for spiritual support (O&#x2019;Brien, 2017).</p>
<p class="h8">Interpersonal Environment</p>
<p class="nonindent">A patient&#x2019;s ethnicity and support system are considered when obtaining a health history. Attitudes and beliefs about health, illness, health care, hospitalization, the use of medications, and the use of complementary and alternative therapies, which are derived from personal experiences, vary according to ethnicity. A person from another culture may have different views of personal health practices from those of the health care practitioner (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>) (see later discussion on Cultural Assessment).</p>
<p class="indent">The beliefs, customs, and practices that have been shared from generation to generation are known as ethnic patterns. The influence of these patterns on health-related behaviors and patient&#x2019;s perceptions of health and illness, as well as on how a patient reacts to health problems and interacts with health care providers, cannot be underestimated. Ethnic patterns can be expressed through language, dress, dietary choices, and role behaviors. The following questions may assist in obtaining relevant information:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Where did your parents or ancestors come from? When?</span></li>
<li><span>What language do you speak at home?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there certain customs or values that are important to you?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you have any specific practices to keep in good health or for treating illness?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Support systems are another important aspect of a patient&#x2019;s interpersonal environment. The evaluation of a patient&#x2019;s family structure (members, ages, and roles), patterns of communication, and the quality of the patient&#x2019;s relationships is an integral part of assessing support systems. Although the traditional family is recognized as a mother, a father, and children, many different types of living arrangements exist within our society. &#x201C;Family&#x201D; may mean two or more people bound by emotional ties or commitments. Live-in companions, roommates, and close friends can also play a significant role in a person&#x2019;s support system. Keeping this in mind, nurses should use neutral terms and be sensitive when evaluating family structure. For example, the interview can begin with an open-ended question, such as &#x201C;Tell me about your family and social support system.&#x201D; Neutral terms should also be used when asking follow-up questions about partners/significant others and parents/guardians (for further discussion, see <a href="c54.xhtml">Chapter 54</a>, <a href="c54-sec04.xhtml#tt54-1">Table&#x00A0;54-1</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Lifestyle Patterns</p>
<p class="nonindent">The lifestyle section of the patient profile provides information about health-related behaviors. These behaviors include patterns of sleep, nutrition, and health promotion, as well as personal habits such as smoking and the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and caffeine. Adequate sleep and nutrition are important to maintain optimal health; therefore, it is important to inquire about usual sleep habits and bedtime routines, as well as perform a nutritional assessment. Although most people readily describe their exercise patterns or recreational activities, many are unwilling to report their smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drug use, and many deny or understate the degree to which they use such substances. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that abuse of prescription drugs has replaced abuse of illicit drugs as a leading cause of drug-induced deaths (CDC, 2019c). Questions such as &#x201C;What kind of alcohol do you enjoy drinking?&#x201D; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page80" title="80"></span>may elicit more accurate information than &#x201C;Do you drink?&#x201D; Determining the specific type of alcohol (e.g., wine, liquor, beer) the patient drinks and the last time they had a drink is an important aspect of the assessment. Every patient should be asked about alcohol use, substance use disorder, and misuse of prescription drugs (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The lifestyle of some people includes the use of mood-altering substances. People with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;substance use disorder:&lt;/b&gt; a maladaptive pattern of substance use that causes physical and emotional harm with the potential for disruption of daily life">substance use disorder</button></strong> (SUD) use illegally obtained drugs, prescribed or OTC medications, and alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs in ineffective attempts to cope with the pressures, strains, and burdens of life. Over time, physiologic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems develop as a result of SUD.</p>
<p class="indent">If alcohol abuse is suspected, additional information may be obtained by using common alcohol screening questionnaires such as the CAGE (Cutting down, Annoyance by criticism, Guilty feeling, and Eye-openers) (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib231">Ewing, 1984</a>), AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), or the shorter AUDIT-C questionnaire (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib230">Drug and Alcohol Clinical Advisory Service [DACAS], 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Similar questions can be used to elicit information about smoking and caffeine consumption. Questions about illicit drug use follow naturally after questions about smoking, caffeine consumption, and alcohol use. A nonjudgmental approach makes it easier for a person to respond truthfully and factually. If street names or unfamiliar terms are used to describe drugs, the person is asked to define the terms used.</p>
<p class="indent">Investigation of the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle patterns should also include questions about complementary, alternative, and integrative health therapies, which may include energy and breath work, botanical and manual healing, and mind&#x2013;body therapies (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Fontaine, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Marijuana is used for the management of symptoms, especially pain and anorexia, in several chronic conditions. Since the marijuana plant contains chemicals, called cannabinoids, that may help treat a range of illnesses or symptoms, many people have argued that it should be legal for medical purposes. This has led to the legalization of marijuana for medical use in many states. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not recognized or approved the marijuana plant as medicine; however, the FDA has approved medications that contain cannabinoids in pill form. Currently, the two main cannabinoids from the marijuana plant that are of medical interest are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The FDA-approved drugs dronabinol and nabilone both contain THC. They are indicated specifically to treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and to increase appetite in patients with extreme weight loss caused by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). THC also may decrease pain, inflammation, and muscle control problems. Unlike THC, drugs that contain CBD are not intoxicating and do not make people &#x201C;high.&#x201D; CBD is useful in reducing pain, inflammation, controlling epileptic seizures, and possibly even treating mental illness and addiction (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib243">National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The assessment of a patient&#x2019;s lifestyle patterns also includes questions about continuing health promotion and health-screening practices. The health history assessment should include the type, frequency, and duration of exercise and recreational activities. Inquiry should also include the types of health screenings the patient has completed. If the person has not been involved in these practices in the past, they should be educated about their importance and referred to the appropriate health care providers. Nurses should recognize the importance of encouraging culturally competent care and health promotion activities (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Disability</p>
<p class="nonindent">The general patient profile needs to contain information about any hearing, vision, or other type of physical disability. In addition, developmental, intellectual, sensory, or cognitive disabilities need to be addressed. The presence of an obvious physical limitation (e.g., using crutches to walk or using a wheelchair to get around) necessitates further investigation. The initial cause or onset of the disability, as well as the impact on functional ability, should be established. <a href="#ct4-4">Chart&#x00A0;4-4</a> presents specific issues that the nurse should consider when obtaining health histories and conducting physical assessments of patients with disability.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">When conducting a health assessment, a key part of the nurse&#x2019;s role is to ask all adult patients if they have served in the U.S. military, and, if so, their branch of service, length of service, and assigned duty stations (i.e., geographic locations and type of assignments). Patients who are veterans should be specifically asked about their experiences with violence and war, regardless of their ages, genders, lengths of service, and assignments. Asking about violent experiences works best when it is viewed as a normal and natural part of the nursing assessment. The nurse&#x2019;s approach to gathering this information should be similar to that used when asking patients about sleep or activity difficulties or dietary or sexual concerns. It is important to try to establish a connection with the patient first. Taking time to listen in a nonjudgmental, nondirective way and noting that confidentiality of responses will be ensured helps create a safe, supportive atmosphere. Traumatic experiences from witnessing violence are common for combat veterans and veterans who have experienced other forms of violence, placing them at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib246">Possemato, Maisto, Wade, et al., 2015</a>), pain (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib234">Flynn, Cook, Kallen, et al., 2017</a>), and increased suicide risk compared with nonveterans (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib238">Kang, Bullman, Smolenski, et al., 2015</a>). Pain is a leading cause of disability among active duty service members and veterans (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Flynn et al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Veterans may be eligible for Veterans Administration (VA) benefits, including access to VA financial aid services and health care through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health care system in the United States. The VHA provides care to veterans at more than 1200 health care facilities, including 170 medical centers and 1000 outpatient sites that provide health care services of varying complexity. In addition, benefits-eligible veterans who reside in rural areas may opt to receive some VHA services through mobile vans and telehealth services. Less than half of the 20 million benefits-eligible U.S. veterans are enrolled in VA benefits services (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Chokshi &#x0026; Sommers, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Self-Concept</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Self-concept</strong>, a person&#x2019;s view of themself/themselves, is an image that develops over many years. To assess self-concept, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page81" title="81"></span>the interviewer might ask how a person views life, using a question such as &#x201C;How do you feel about your life in general?&#x201D; A person&#x2019;s self-concept can be threatened very easily by changes in physical function, appearance, or other threats to health. The impact of certain medical conditions or surgical interventions, such as a colostomy or a mastectomy, can threaten body image. In addition, patients with implantable devices may have body image concerns, particularly those with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and ventricular assist devices (VADs) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page82" title="82"></span>(<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib221">Alonso, Mollard, Zimmerman, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib235">Frydensberg, Skovbakke, Pedersen, et al., 2018</a>). The question, &#x201C;Do you have any particular concerns about your body?&#x201D; may elicit useful information about self-image.</p>

</div>
<div class="box3">
<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Assessing the Health of People with Disability</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">People with disability are entitled to the same level of health assessment and physical examination as people without disability. Physical and mental disability should be explained in the health history. Patients with mental disability are often marginalized from mainstream health care services because of the complexities of their disability. It is appropriate to ask the patient, or caregiver when necessary, what assistance they need rather than assuming that help is needed for all activities or that, if assistance is needed, the patient will ask for it.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Health History</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Communication between the nurse and the patient is essential. To ensure that the patient is able to respond to assessment questions and provide needed information, interpreters, assistive listening devices, or other alternative formats (e.g., Braille, large-print forms) may be required.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">When interpreters are needed, interpretation services should be arranged. Health care facilities have a responsibility to provide these services without charge to the patient. Family members (especially children) should <em>not</em> be used as interpreters, because doing so violates the patient&#x2019;s right to privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse should speak directly to the patient and not to family members or others who have accompanied the patient. If patients have impaired hearing, they should be encouraged to use their hearing aids or hearing assistance technology during the assessment. The patient should be able to see the nurse&#x2019;s face clearly during the health history so that speech reading and nonverbal clues can be used to aid communication.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The health history should address general health issues that are important to all patients, including sexual history and risk for abuse, including intimate partner violence. It should also address the impact of the patient&#x2019;s disability on health issues and access to care, as well as the effect of the patient&#x2019;s current health problem on their disability. An assessment of whether the patient&#x2019;s quality of life meets their expectations should be included in the health history.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse should verify what the patient has said; if the patient has difficulty communicating verbally, the nurse should ask for clarification rather than assume that it is too difficult for the patient to do so. Most people would rather be asked to explain again than run the risk of being misunderstood.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Physical Examination</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Inaccessible facilities remain a major barrier to health care for people with disability. Barriers include lack of ramps and grab bars, inaccessible restrooms, small examination rooms, and examination tables that cannot be lowered to allow the patient to move himself or herself onto, or be transferred easily and safely to, the examination table. The patient may need help getting undressed for the physical examination (and dressed again), moving on and off the examination table, and maintaining positions usually required during physical examination maneuvers. It is important to ask the patient what assistance is needed.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">If the patient has impaired sensory function (e.g., lack of sensation, hearing or vision loss), it is important to inform the patient that you will be touching them. Furthermore, it is important to explain all procedures and maneuvers.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Gynecologic examinations should <em>not</em> be deferred because a patient has a disability or is assumed to be sexually inactive. Explanations of the examination are important for all women, and even more so for women with disability, because they may have had previous negative experiences. Slow, gentle moving and positioning of the patient for the gynecologic examination and warming the speculum before attempting insertion often minimize spasticity in women with neurologically related disability.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Health Screenings and Testing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Many people with disability report that they have not been weighed for years or even decades because they are unable to stand for this measurement. Alternative methods (e.g., use of wheelchair scales) are needed to monitor weight and body mass index. This is particularly important because of the increased incidence of obesity and its effects on health status and transfer of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Patients with disability may require special assistance if urine specimens are to be obtained as part of the visit. They are often able to suggest strategies to obtain urine specimens based on previous experience.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">If it is necessary for the nurse to wear a mask during a procedure or if the patient is unable to see the face of the nurse during a procedure, it is important to explain the procedure and the expected role of the patient ahead of time. If the patient is unable to hear or communicate with the nurse or other health care provider verbally during an examination or diagnostic test, a method of communication (e.g., signaling the patient by tapping the arm, signaling the nurse by using a bell) should be established beforehand.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">People with disability experience difficulties related to obtaining care, challenges accessing health care facilities, perceptions that health professionals are insensitive to their needs, and concerns about the quality of care they receive. Therefore, it is important to ask about health screening and recommendations for screening. In addition, people with disability should be asked about their participation in health promotion activities, because inaccessible environments and other barriers may limit their participation in exercise, health programs, and other health promotion efforts such as health screenings.</p>

<p class="h7">Sexuality</p>
<p class="nonindent">The sexual history is an extremely personal area of assessment. Interviewers are frequently uncomfortable with such questions and ignore this area of the patient profile or conduct a very cursory interview about this subject. It is the nurse&#x2019;s professional and clinical responsibility to discuss issues of sexuality with patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Sexual function may be affected negatively by disease (or treatment), surgery, or aging. In order for the patient to maintain sexual function and optimize quality of life, sexual issues must be addressed. In addition, the interviewer should project a positive attitude related to sexual orientation or toward those who may be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ). In addition, if a patient&#x2019;s sexual orientation and gender identity is not yet known, use of neutral language will help put the patient at ease and enhance the therapeutic relationship (see <a href="c54.xhtml">Chapter 54</a>, <a href="c54-sec04.xhtml#tt54-1">Table&#x00A0;54-1</a>, for examples of gender neutral language and assessment questions).</p>
<p class="indent">Sexual assessment can be approached at the end of the interview or at the time interpersonal or lifestyle factors are assessed; otherwise, it may be easier to discuss sexuality as a part of the genitourinary history within the review of systems. In cisgender female patients, a discussion of sexuality could follow questions about menstruation. In cisgender male patients, a similar discussion could follow questions about the urinary system.</p>
<p class="indent">Obtaining the sexual history provides an opportunity to discuss sexual matters openly and gives the person permission to express sexual concerns to an informed professional. The assessment begins with an orienting sentence such as &#x201C;Next, I would like to ask about your sexual health and practices.&#x201D; This type of opening may lead to a discussion of concerns related to sexual expression or the quality of a relationship, or to questions about contraception, risky sexual behaviors, and safer sex practices. Examples of other questions include &#x201C;Do you have one or more sexual partners?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Are you satisfied with your sexual relationships?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Determining whether a person is sexually active should precede any attempts to explore issues related to sexuality and sexual function. Care should be taken to initiate conversations about sexuality with older adult patients and patients with disability and not to treat them as asexual people. Questions should be worded in such a way that the person feels free to discuss sexuality regardless of marital status or sexual orientation. Direct questions are usually less threatening when prefaced with such statements as &#x201C;Some people feel that&#x2026;&#x201D; or &#x201C;Many people worry about&#x2026;.&#x201D; This suggests the normalcy of such feelings or behavior and encourages the person to share information that might otherwise be omitted because of fear of seeming &#x201C;different.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">If a person answers abruptly or does not wish to carry the discussion any further, then the interviewer should move to the next topic. However, introducing the subject of sexuality indicates to the person that a discussion of sexual concerns is acceptable and can be approached again in the future if so desired (further discussion of the sexual history is presented in <a href="c50.xhtml">Chapters 50</a>, <a href="c53.xhtml">53</a>, and <a href="c54.xhtml">54</a>).</p>
<p class="h8"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Effective health care for older adults requires assessment of sexual health (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Older adults may be stereotyped by misconceptions that they are sick and disabled, have dementia, have lower intelligence and are resistant to change, are not able to have sexual intercourse, or are not interested in sex (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>); however, sexual activity continues in later life, and sexual satisfaction depends on age-related changes (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib247">Ska&#x0142;acka &#x0026; Gerymski, 2019</a>). Literature supports that people not only remain sexually active for a long time into their old age, but also that various forms of sexual activity is associated with their global life satisfaction (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib239">Lee, Vanhoutte, Nazroo, et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib247">Ska&#x0142;acka &#x0026; Gerymski, 2019</a>). Many older adults prefer to engage in more subtle forms of sexual activity (e.g., kissing, cuddling) rather than having intercourse. The frequency of intercourse may diminish because of body changes and health issues that may result from the aging process and/or sexual dysfunction in one or both partners (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib247">Ska&#x0142;acka &#x0026; Gerymski, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Risk for Intimate Partner Violence</p>
<p class="nonindent">Physical, sexual, and psychological violence affects people of both genders and those who identify as gender fluid or nonbinary, as well as people of all ages and from all socioeconomic and ethnic groups. IPV, also called domestic violence, is common in the United States. One in four women in the United States experiences IPV (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib249">Smith, Chen, Basile, et al., 2017</a>). IPV includes physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, as well as sexual coercion and stalking by a current or former intimate partner (HHS, 2019c). Patients rarely discuss this topic unless specifically asked about it. Therefore, it is important to ask direct questions, such as:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Is anyone physically hurting you or forcing you to engage in sexual activities?</span></li>
<li><span>Has anyone ever hurt you physically or threatened to do so?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you ever afraid of anyone close to you (your partner, caregiver, or other family members)?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patients who are older or have disability are at increased risk for IPV and should be asked about it as a routine part of assessment (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib250">Truong, Burnes, Alaggia, et al., 2019</a>). However, when older patients are questioned directly, they rarely admit to abuse. Health care professionals should assess for risk factors, such as high levels of stress or alcoholism in caregivers, or evidence of violence, emotional outbursts, or financial, emotional, or physical dependency in patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Two additional questions have been found to be effective in uncovering specific types of IPV that may occur only in people with disability:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Does anyone prevent you from using a wheelchair, cane, respirator, or other assistive device?</span></li>
<li><span>Does anyone you depend on refuse to help you with an important personal need, such as taking your medicine, getting to the bathroom, getting in or out of bed, bathing, dressing, or getting food or drink?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">If a person&#x2019;s response indicates that IPV is a risk, further assessment is warranted, and efforts are made to ensure the patient&#x2019;s safety and provide access to appropriate community <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page83" title="83"></span>and professional resources and support systems (further discussion of IPV is presented in <a href="c50.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;50</a> and <a href="c67.xhtml">67</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Stress and Coping Responses</p>
<p class="nonindent">Each person handles stress differently. How well people adapt to stress depends on their ability to cope. During a health history, past coping patterns and perceptions of current stresses and anticipated outcomes are explored to identify the person&#x2019;s overall ability to handle stress. It is especially important to identify the expectations that a person may have related to family, friends, and caregivers in terms of providing financial, emotional, or physical support (further discussion of stress and coping is presented in <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
