<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">colloids:</span> intravenous solutions that contain molecules that are too large to pass through capillary membranes</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">crystalloids:</span> intravenous electrolyte solutions that move freely between the intravascular compartment and interstitial spaces</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">cytokines:</span> messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (<em>synonyms</em>: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">distributive shock:</span> shock state resulting from displacement of intravascular volume creating a relative hypovolemia and inadequate delivery of oxygen to the cells</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypovolemic shock:</span> shock state resulting from decreased intravascular volume due to fluid loss</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">multiple organ dysfunction syndrome:</span> presence of altered function of two or more organs in an acutely ill patient such that interventions are necessary to support continued organ function</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">neurogenic shock:</span> shock state resulting from loss of sympathetic tone causing relative hypovolemia</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">sepsis:</span> life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">septic shock:</span> a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">shock:</span> life-threatening physiologic condition in which there is inadequate blood flow to tissues and cells of the body</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">systemic inflammatory response syndrome:</span> a syndrome resulting from a clinical insult that initiates an inflammatory response that is systemic, rather than localized to the site of the insult; a type of cytokine release syndrome also referred to as cytokine storm</p>

<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;shock:&lt;/b&gt; life-threatening physiologic condition in which there is inadequate blood flow to tissues and cells of the body">Shock</button></strong> is a life-threatening condition that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. Many conditions may cause shock; irrespective of the cause, tissue hypoperfusion prevents adequate oxygen delivery to cells, leading to cell dysfunction and death. The progression of shock is neither linear nor predictable, and shock states, especially septic shock (the most life-threatening form of sepsis), comprise an area of ongoing clinical research. Nurses caring for patients with shock and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page274" title="274"></span>those at risk for shock must understand the underlying mechanisms of the various shock states (i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive [see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>], and distributive shock [i.e., septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic]) and recognize the subtle as well as more obvious signs of each of these states. If shock is not effectively treated, <strong>multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)</strong> which is the presence of altered function of two or more organs in an acutely ill patient such that interventions are necessary to support continued organ function may ensue, often resulting in patient death. MODS may be a complication of any form of shock but is most commonly seen in patients with sepsis. Rapid assessment with early recognition and response to shock states and sepsis is essential to the patient&#x2019;s recovery.</p>
