<h4 class="h4" id="s2353">Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</strong> is an inflammatory condition of the pelvic cavity that may begin with cervicitis and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1685" title="1685"></span>involve the uterus (endometritis), fallopian tubes (salpingitis), ovaries (oophoritis), pelvic peritoneum, or pelvic vascular system. Infection, which may be acute, subacute, recurrent, or chronic and localized or widespread, is usually caused by bacteria but may be attributed to a virus, fungus, or parasite. Gonorrheal and chlamydial organisms are common causes, but most cases of PID are polymicrobial. While incidence has been declining over the past decades, data from a recent survey indicates the rate of PID in sexually experienced women of reproductive age (18 to 44 years of age) is 4.4% or 2.5 million women (CDC, 2017c; Curry, Williams, &#x0026; Penny, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Short- and long-term consequences can occur. The fallopian tubes become narrow and scarred, which increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy (fertilized eggs trapped in the tube), infertility, recurrent pelvic pain, tubo-ovarian <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;abscess:&lt;/b&gt; localized collection of purulent material surrounded by inflamed tissues">abscess</button></strong> (a collection of purulent material), and recurrent disease (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Curry et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2354">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The exact pathogenesis of PID has not been determined, but it is presumed that organisms usually enter the body through the vagina, pass through the cervical canal, colonize the endocervix, and move upward into the uterus. Under various conditions, the organisms may proceed to one or both fallopian tubes and ovaries and into the pelvis. In bacterial infections that occur after childbirth or abortion, pathogens are disseminated directly through the tissues that support the uterus by way of the lymphatics and blood vessels (see <a href="#ff51-1">Fig.&#x00A0;51-1</a>A). In pregnancy, the increased blood supply required by the placenta provides a wider pathway for infection. These postpartum and postabortion infections tend to be unilateral. Infections can cause perihepatic inflammation when the organism invades the peritoneum.</p>
<p class="indent">In gonorrheal infections, the gonococci pass through the cervical canal and into the uterus, where the environment, especially during menstruation, allows them to multiply rapidly and spread to the fallopian tubes and into the pelvis (see <a href="#ff51-1">Fig.&#x00A0;51-1</a>B). The infection is usually bilateral.</p>
<p class="indent">In rare instances, organisms (e.g., tuberculosis) gain access to the reproductive organs by way of the bloodstream from the lungs (see <a href="#ff51-1">Fig.&#x00A0;51-1</a>C). One of the most common causes of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;salpingitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the fallopian tube">salpingitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the fallopian tube) is chlamydia, possibly accompanied by gonorrhea.</p>
<p class="indent">Pelvic infection is most often sexually transmitted but can also occur with invasive procedures such as endometrial biopsy, abortion, hysteroscopy, or insertion of an intrauterine device. Bacterial vaginosis (a vaginal infection) may predispose women to pelvic infection. Risk factors include early age at first sexual experience multiple sexual partners, frequent penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse, penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse without condoms, sex with a partner with an STI, and a history of STIs or previous pelvic infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2355">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of pelvic infection usually begin with vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, dysuria, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, tenderness that occurs after menses, and postcoital bleeding. Other symptoms include fever, general malaise, anorexia, nausea, headache, and possibly vomiting (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Norris, 2019</a>). On pelvic examination, intense tenderness may be noted on palpation of the uterus or movement of the cervix (cervical motion tenderness). Symptoms may be acute and severe or low grade and subtle (CDC, 2017c; Curry et al., 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2356">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pelvic or generalized peritonitis, abscesses, strictures, and fallopian tube obstruction may develop. Obstruction may cause an ectopic pregnancy in the future if a fertilized egg cannot pass a tubal stricture, or scar tissue may occlude the tubes, resulting in sterility. Adhesions are common and often result in chronic pelvic pain; they eventually may require removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2357">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is prescribed, usually a combination of ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and metronidazole. Women are most often treated as outpatients and monitored carefully. Indications for hospitalization include surgical emergencies, pregnancy, no clinical response to outpatient oral antimicrobial therapy, inability to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen, severe illness (i.e., nausea, vomiting, or high fever), and tubo-ovarian abscess (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Curry et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Norris, 2019</a>). Treatment of sexual partners is necessary to prevent reinfection.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2358">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses for both the physical and emotional effects of PID. The patient may feel well one day and experience vague symptoms and discomfort the next. She may also suffer from constipation and menstrual difficulties.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is hospitalized, the nurse prepares the patient for further diagnostic evaluation and surgical intervention as prescribed. Accurate recording of vital signs, intake and output, and the characteristics and amount of vaginal discharge is necessary as a guide to therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse administers analgesic agents as prescribed for pain relief. Adequate rest and a healthy diet are encouraged. In addition, the nurse minimizes the transmission of infection by adhering to appropriate infection control practices and performing meticulous hand hygiene.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient must be informed of the need for precautions and must be encouraged to take part in procedures to prevent infecting others and protect herself from reinfection. The use of condoms is essential to prevent infection and sequelae. If reinfection occurs or if the infection spreads, symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, malaise, malodorous purulent vaginal discharge, and leukocytosis. Patient education consists of explaining how pelvic infections occur, how they can be controlled and avoided, and the associated signs and symptoms. Guidelines and instructions provided to the patient are summarized in <a href="#ct51-3">Chart&#x00A0;51-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">All patients who have had PID need to be informed of the signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy (pain, abnormal bleeding, delayed menses, faintness, dizziness, and shoulder pain), because they are prone to this complication. See <a href="c50.xhtml">Chapter 50</a> for a discussion of ectopic pregnancy.</p>
