<h4 class="h4" id="s2295">Contraception</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 61 million women in the United States are in their childbearing years (i.e., between the ages of 15 and 44 years). Those who are sexually active and do not want to become pregnant but could become pregnant if they and their partners fail to use a contraceptive method, are at risk of unintended pregnancy. Thus, approximately 43 million women of childbearing age are at risk for unintended pregnancy (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3621">Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2018</a>). Approximately 45% of the pregnancies each year in the United States are unintended and can result in negative health consequences and are an enormous financial burden to the health care system (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3622">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 2019</a>). Family planning benefits mothers, newborns, families, and communities.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses who are involved in helping patients make contraceptive choices need to listen, take time to answer questions, and educate and assist patients in choosing the contraceptive method they prefer (see <a href="#ct50-8">Chart&#x00A0;50-8</a>). It is important for women to receive unbiased and nonjudgmental information, understand the benefits and risks of each contraceptive method, learn about alternatives and how to use them, and receive positive reinforcement and acceptance of their choice. Nurses also have the opportunity to dispel myths and misinformation surrounding contraception. <a href="#ff50-5">Figure&#x00A0;50-5</a> provides an overview of the effectiveness of family planning methods.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2296">Contraindications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Coexisting medical disorders may make contraception a complex issue. Contraception needs to be addressed individually in women with preexisting conditions. With the aid of a thorough history, nurses are well positioned to aid patients in choosing the safest, most effective method of contraception to meet their individual needs.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2297">Abstinence</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Abstinence, or celibacy, is the only completely effective means of preventing pregnancy. Abstinence may not be a desired or available option for many women because of cultural expectations and their own and their partner&#x2019;s values and sexual needs.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="mac2">Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) Methods</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods are the most effective reversible methods for pregnancy prevention with a failure rate of less than 1% (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3657">Moore, Edie, Johnson, et al., 2019</a>). Encouraging the use of LARC methods for appropriate candidates may help lower unintended pregnancy rates in the United States. With few contraindications, the LARC methods should be offered as first-tier contraception to most women (ACOG, 2015 reaffirmed 2018; <a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Moore et al., 2019</a>). LARC methods include the IUD and the single-rod implant (ACOG, 2017).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intrauterine Device</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An IUD is a small device, usually T shaped that is inserted into the uterine cavity to prevent pregnancy. A string attached to the IUD is visible and palpable at the cervical os. Two types of IUDs are the hormonal and nonhormonal. The hormonal IUD releases progestin; a 3-year type and a 5-year are approved for use (ACOG, 2017). The nonhormonal IUD is effective for up to 10 years (ACOG, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Advantages include effectiveness over a long period of time, few if any systemic effects, and reduction of patient error. Almost all women are able to use an IUD. This reversible method of birth control is as effective as female sterilization and more effective than barrier methods (ACOG, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Disadvantages include possible excessive bleeding, cramps, and backaches; a slight risk of tubal pregnancy; slight risk of pelvic infection on insertion; displacement of the device; and, rarely, perforation of the cervix and uterus. If a pregnancy occurs with an IUD in place, the device is removed immediately to avoid infection. Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) may occur on removal (ACOG, 2017).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Implants</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One type of single-rod subdermal implant, effective for 3&#x00A0;years, is approved for use in the United States and is usually placed inside the upper arm using a small incision (ACOG, 2017). After implant insertion, changes in menstrual bleeding are common and include amenorrhea or frequent, infrequent, or prolonged bleeding (ACOG, 2017). Women should be warned about possible discomforts that can be treated with NSAIDs. Heavy or prolonged bleeding should be evaluated for an underlying gynecologic problem, such as interactions with other medications, an STI, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g., polyps, fibroids) (ACOG, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Almost all women are able to use the implant, even those who are lactating. The implant is very convenient as once it is in place the patient does not have to do anything else to prevent pregnancy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2298">Sterilization</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Among women who practice contraception, approximately 22% rely on female and 7% on male sterilization (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3621">Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2018</a>). Women and men who choose sterilization should be certain that they no longer wish to have children, no matter how the circumstances in their life may change. Vasectomy (male sterilization) and tubal ligation (female sterilization) are compared in <a href="#tt50-4">Table&#x00A0;50-4</a>. See <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a> for discussion of vasectomy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2299">Hormonal Contraception</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Oral contraceptives block ovarian stimulation by preventing the release of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. In the absence of FSH, a follicle does not ripen, and ovulation does not occur. Progestins (synthetic forms of progesterone) suppress the LH surge, prevent ovulation, and also render the cervical mucus impenetrable to sperm. Hormonal contraceptive agents may be intrauterine, implantable, injectable, oral, transdermal, or intravaginal. (See previous discussion of LARC methods.) These methods contain either a combination of estrogen and progestin or progestin-only. The combined methods include combination oral contraceptives, the transdermal patch, and the intravaginal ring. The progestin-only methods include the intrauterine system, the implant, the injectable, and the &#x201C;mini-&#x201D; pill. Hormonal contraception methods work by inhibiting ovulation (with the exception of the mini-pill and the intrauterine system).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Methods of Hormonal Contraception</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A wide variety of hormonal methods of birth control are available. Combination methods include the combination of oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, and transdermal patch. Progestin-only methods include the progestin-only pills or &#x201C;mini-pills,&#x201D; once-every-3-month injection, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, and single-rod subdermal implant (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients need to be aware that hormonal contraceptives protect them from pregnancy but not from STIs or HIV infection. In addition, sex with multiple partners or sex without a condom may also result in chlamydial and other infections, including HIV infection.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Oral Contraceptives</p>
<p class="nonindent">Many women use oral contraceptive preparations of synthetic estrogens and progestins. A variety of formulations are available. Extended regimens of oral hormonal contraceptive agents are an option for women who have heavy or uncomfortable menstrual bleeding or who wish to have fewer periods. With the use of these regimens, women may have an increased occurrence of breakthrough bleeding; the blood may be dark brown rather than red. It may be more difficult to tell if a pregnancy occurs with this method, although pregnancy is unlikely if pills are taken as prescribed (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Transdermal Contraceptives</p>
<p class="nonindent">Transdermal contraception is done through a thin, beige, matchbook-size skin patch that releases an estrogen and a progestin continuously. It is changed every week for 3 weeks, and no patch is used during the fourth week, resulting in withdrawal bleeding. The effectiveness of transdermal contraception is comparable to that of oral contraceptives. Its risks are similar to those of oral contraceptives and include an increased risk of venous thromboemboli formation. The patch may be applied to the torso, chest, arms, or thighs; it should not be applied to the breasts. The patch is convenient and more easily remembered than a daily pill but is not as effective for women who weigh more than 90 kg (198 lb). One additional side effect with the patch includes possible skin reaction such as irritation, redness, pigment changes, or rash at the site of the patch (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Vaginal Contraceptives</p>
<p class="nonindent">An etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is a combination hormonal contraceptive that releases estrogen and progestin. It is as effective as oral contraceptive agents and results in lower hormone blood levels than oral contraceptives. The ring is flexible, does not require sizing or fitting, and is effective when placed anywhere in the vagina. Patients are occasionally reluctant to consider vaginal methods of contraception unless discussed openly and as a convenient alternative to other routes of administration. Some women are uncomfortable with this method and may fear that the ring may migrate or be uncomfortable or be noticed by a partner. The ring is usually more expensive than oral contraceptives as well.</p>
<p class="h7">Injectable Contraceptives</p>
<p class="nonindent">An intramuscular injection of a long-acting progestin every 13 weeks inhibits ovulation and provides a reliable, private, and convenient contraceptive method (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). A subcutaneous formulation is also available. It can be used by women who are lactating and those with hypertension, liver disease, migraine headaches, heart disease, and hemoglobinopathies. With continued use, women must be prepared for irregular bleeding episodes and spotting decrease, or amenorrhea.</p>
<p class="indent">Advantages of long-acting progestin include reduction of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding. It may reduce the risk of pelvic infection, has been associated with improvement in hematologic status in women with sickle cell disease, and does not interfere with the efficacy of seizure agents. It decreases the risk of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1662" title="1662"></span>endometrial cancer, PID, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Possible side effects of long-acting progestin include irregular menstrual bleeding, bloating, headaches, hair loss, decreased sex drive, bone loss, and weight loss or weight gain. The contraceptive does not protect against STIs. Although bone loss may occur while using the injections, when the injections are stopped, sometimes all of the bone loss is regained. Use of this method should be limited to 2 years of use because of loss of bone mineral density (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Long-acting progestin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and those who have abnormal vaginal bleeding of unknown cause, breast or pelvic cancer, or sensitivity to synthetic progestin.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2300">Mechanical Barriers</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Diaphragm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The diaphragm is an effective contraceptive device that consists of a round, flexible spring (50 to 90 mm wide) covered with a domelike latex rubber cup. A spermicidal (contraceptive) jelly or cream is used to coat the concave side of the diaphragm before it is inserted deep into the vagina, covering the cervix completely. The spermicide inhibits spermatozoa from entering the cervical canal. The diaphragm is not felt by the user or her partner when properly fitted and inserted. Because women vary in size, the diaphragm must be sized and fitted by an experienced clinician. The woman is instructed in using and caring for the device. A return demonstration ensures that the woman can insert the diaphragm correctly and that it covers the cervix.</p>
<p class="indent">Each time the woman uses the diaphragm, she should examine it carefully. By holding it up to a bright light, she should ensure that it has no pinpoint holes, cracks, or tears; if any are present, the diaphragm should not be used. She then applies spermicidal jelly or cream and inserts the diaphragm. The diaphragm should remain in place at least 6 hours after coitus (no more than 12 hours). Additional spermicide is necessary if more than 6 hours have passed before penile-vaginal intercourse occurs and before each act of repeated penile-vaginal intercourse. On removal, the diaphragm should be cleansed thoroughly with mild soap and water, rinsed, and dried before being stored in its original container.</p>
<p class="indent">Disadvantages include allergic reactions in those who are sensitive to latex and an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. Toxic shock syndrome has been reported in some diaphragm users but is rare.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse must assess the woman for possible latex allergy because the use of latex barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm, cervical cap, male condoms) may cause severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients with latex allergy.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Cervical Cap</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The cervical cap is much smaller (22 to 35 mm) than the diaphragm and covers only the cervix. If a woman can feel her cervix, she can usually learn to use a cervical cap. The chief advantage is that the cap may be left in place for 2 days after coitus. Although convenient to use, the cervical cap may cause cervical irritation; therefore, before fitting a cap, most primary providers obtain a Pap smear and repeat the smear after 3 months. The cap is used with a spermicide and does not require additional spermicide for repeated penile-vaginal intercourse.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Female Condom</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The female condom was developed to give control of barrier protection to women&#x2014;to provide them with protection from STIs and HIV as well as pregnancy. The female condom consists of a cylinder of polyurethane enclosed at one end by a closed ring that covers the cervix and at the other end by an open ring that covers the perineum (see <a href="#ff50-6">Fig.&#x00A0;50-6</a>). Advantages include some degree of protection from STIs (i.e., HPV, herpes simplex virus, and HIV) (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Disadvantages are that female condoms are more costly than male condoms and the inability to use the female condom with some positions (i.e., standing).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Spermicides</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Spermicides are made from nonoxynol-9 or octoxynol and are available over the counter as foams, gels, films, suppositories, and sponges and also on condoms. Spermicides do not protect women from HIV or other STIs (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Advantages of spermicides include they are nonhormonal, are user controlled, do not cause systemic side effects, and are immediately effective (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Male Condom</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The male condom is an impermeable, snug-fitting cover applied to the erect penis before it enters the vaginal canal. The tip of the condom is pinched while being applied to leave space for ejaculate. If no space is left, ejaculation may cause a tear or hole in the condom and reduce its effectiveness. The penis, with the condom held in place, is removed from the vagina while still erect to prevent the ejaculate from leaking. Condoms are available in large and small sizes.</p>
<p class="indent">The latex condom also creates a barrier against transmission of STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and HIV) by body fluids and may reduce the risk of herpes virus transmission. However, natural condoms (those made from animal tissue) do not protect against HIV infection. Nurses need to reassure women that they have a right to insist that their male partners use condoms and a right to refuse sex without condoms, although women in abusive relationships may increase their risk of abuse, maltreatment, and neglect by doing so. Some women carry condoms with them to be certain that one is available. Nurses should be familiar and comfortable with instructions about using condoms because many women need to know about this way of protecting themselves from HIV and other STIs. Condoms do not provide complete protection from STIs, however, because HPV may be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. Other STIs may be transmitted if any abraded skin is exposed to body fluids. This information should be included in patient education.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse needs to consider the possibility of latex allergy. Swelling and itching can also occur. Possible warning signs of latex allergy include oral itching after blowing up a balloon or eating kiwis, bananas, pineapples, passion fruit, avocados, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1663" title="1663"></span>or chestnuts. Because many contraceptives are made of latex, patients who experience burning or itching while using latex contraceptives are instructed to see their primary provider. Alternatives to latex condoms include the female condom (Reality) and the male condom (Avanti), made of polyurethane.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2301">Coitus Interruptus or Withdrawal</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Coitus interruptus (removing the penis from the vagina before ejaculation) requires careful control by the male partner. Although it is a frequently used method of preventing pregnancy and better than no method, it is considered an unreliable method of contraception.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2302">Fertility Awareness&#x2013;Based Methods</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fertility awareness is knowing and recognizing when the fertile time occurs in the menstrual cycle. If a couple is practicing fertility awareness as a birth control method to prevent pregnancy, the couple needs to avoid having penile-vaginal intercourse or use a barrier method during the fertile period. If the woman would like to get pregnant, the couple should have penile-vaginal intercourse during the women&#x2019;s fertile days. When used to prevent pregnancy, during the first year of typical use, up to 24 women out of 100 will become pregnant (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3621">Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The most common fertility awareness&#x2013;based method is the Standard Days method. With this method, users must avoid unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse on days 8 to 19 of the menstrual cycle. The Standard Days method requires the woman to determine the fertile days of her cycle. This method works best if the woman has a regular menstrual cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantages of using fertility awareness&#x2013;based methods to prevent pregnancy are that they are safe, inexpensive, and approved by some religions that do not approve of other methods of contraception. The disadvantage is that they require discipline by the couple, who must monitor the menstrual cycle and abstain from penile-vaginal intercourse during the fertile phase.</p>
<p class="indent">Ovulation detection methods are available in most pharmacies. The presence of the enzyme guaiacol peroxidase in cervical mucus signals ovulation 6 days beforehand and also affects mucosal viscosity. Over-the-counter test kits are easy to use and reliable but can be expensive. Ovulation prediction kits are more effective for planning conception than for avoiding it.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2303">Emergency Contraception</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Emergency contraception are methods that can be used by women after unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse to prevent pregnancy (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Nurses need to be aware of emergency contraception as an option for women and the indications for its use. It is clearly not suitable for long-term avoidance of pregnancy because it is not as effective as oral contraceptives or other reliable methods used regularly. However, it is valuable following penile-vaginal intercourse when a pregnancy is not intended and in emergency situations such as rape, a defective or torn condom or diaphragm, or other situations that may result in unintended conception.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Methods of Emergency Contraception</h6>
<p class="h7">Emergency Contraceptive Pills</p>
<p class="nonindent">Three kinds of emergency contraceptive pills are available in the United States. A properly timed, adequate dose of medication after penile-vaginal intercourse without effective contraception, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1664" title="1664"></span>or when a method has failed, can prevent pregnancy by inhibiting or delaying ovulation. Emergency contraceptive pills should be taken as soon as possible and within 5 days of unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nausea, a common side effect, can be minimized by taking the medication with meals and with an antiemetic agent. Other side effects, such as breast soreness and irregular bleeding, may occur but are transient. Patients who use emergency contraceptive pills should be advised of the potential failure rate and also counseled about other contraceptive methods. There are no known contraindications to the use of this method, except an established pregnancy (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3617">Casanova et al, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse reviews with the patient instructions for emergency contraception based on the medication regimen prescribed. If the woman is breast-feeding, a progestin-only formulation is prescribed. To avoid exposing infants to synthetic hormones through breast milk, the patient can manually express milk and bottle-feed for 24 hours after treatment. The patient should be informed that her next menstrual period may begin a few days earlier or a few days later than expected. She is instructed to return for a pregnancy test if she has not had a menstrual period in 3 weeks and should be offered another visit to provide a regular method of contraception if she does not have one currently.</p>
<p class="h7">Postcoital Intrauterine Device Insertion</p>
<p class="nonindent">Postcoital IUD insertion, another form of emergency contraception, involves insertion of a copper-bearing IUD within 5 days of coitus (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). The copper-bearing IUD prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change in sperm and egg before they can meet. The patient may experience discomfort on insertion and may have heavier menstrual periods and increased cramping. Contraindications include a confirmed or suspected pregnancy or any contraindication to regular IUD use. The patient must be informed that there is a risk that insertion of an IUD may disrupt a pregnancy that is already present.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2304">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who use emergency contraception may be anxious, embarrassed, and lacking information about birth control. The nurse must be supportive and nonjudgmental and provide facts and appropriate patient education. If the patient repeatedly uses this method of birth control, she should be informed that the failure rate with this method is higher than with a regularly used method. Nurses can educate and inform women about emergency contraception options to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions.
