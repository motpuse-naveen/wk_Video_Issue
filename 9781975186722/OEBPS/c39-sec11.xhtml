<h4 class="h4" id="s1624">Esophageal Spasm</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The three types of esophageal spasm include jackhammer esophagus, diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), and type III <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1254" title="1254"></span>(spastic) achalasia. In jackhammer esophagus, referred to as hypercontractile esophagus, spasms occur on more than 20% of swallows at a very high amplitude, duration, and length. In DES, the spasms are normal in amplitude but are premature/uncoordinated, move quickly, and occur at various places in the esophagus at once. Type III achalasia is characterized by lower esophageal sphincter obstruction with esophageal spasms (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Clermont &#x0026; Ahuja, 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1625">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All three forms of esophageal spasm are characterized by dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, and chest pain similar to that of coronary artery spasm.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1626">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Esophageal manometry, which measures the motility and internal pressure of the esophagus, remains the standard test for irregular and high-amplitude spasms.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1627">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In all three spastic disorders, smooth muscle relaxants such as calcium channel blockers and nitrates may be used to reduce the pressure and amplitude of contractions. Like the treatment for achalasia, botulinum toxin may be used in specific frail patients who cannot tolerate other interventions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may also be indicated, especially if symptoms of GERD are present (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Clermont &#x0026; Ahuja, 2018</a>). Small, frequent feedings and a soft diet are usually recommended to decrease the esophageal pressure and irritation that lead to spasm. If conservative therapies do not provide relief, Heller myotomy or POEM may be tried (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Clermont &#x0026; Ahuja, 2018</a>). Since many patients also experience GERD, surgical procedures that also address GERD may be beneficial (see later discussion).</p>
