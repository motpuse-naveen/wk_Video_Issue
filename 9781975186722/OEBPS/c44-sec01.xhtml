<h4 class="h4" id="s1878"><strong>The Gallbladder</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">The gallbladder, a pear-shaped, hollow, saclike organ that is 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) long, lies in a shallow depression on the inferior surface of the liver, to which it is attached by loose connective tissue. The capacity of the gallbladder is 30 to 50 mL of bile. Its wall is composed largely of smooth muscle. The gallbladder is connected to the common bile duct (CBD) by the cystic duct (see <a href="#ff44-1">Fig. 44-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The gallbladder functions as a storage depot for bile. Between meals, when the sphincter of Oddi is closed, bile produced by the hepatocytes enters the gallbladder. During storage, a large portion of the water in bile is absorbed through the walls of the gallbladder; thus, bile in the gallbladder is five to 10 times more concentrated than that originally secreted by the liver. When food enters the duodenum, the gallbladder contracts and the sphincter of Oddi (located at the junction of the CBD with the duodenum) relaxes. Relaxation of this sphincter allows the bile to enter the intestine. This response is mediated by secretion of the hormone <strong>cholecystokinin (CCK)</strong> from the intestinal wall (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>). CCK is the major stimulus for digestive enzyme secretion and acts by stimulating the gallbladder to contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Bile is composed of water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate) along with significant amounts of lecithin, fatty acids, cholesterol, bilirubin, and bile salts. The bile salts, together with cholesterol, assist in emulsification of fats in the distal ileum. They are then reabsorbed into the portal blood for return to the liver, after which they are once again excreted into the bile. This pathway from hepatocytes to bile to intestine and back to the hepatocytes is called the <em>enterohepatic circulation.</em> Because of this circulation, only a small fraction of the bile salts that enter the intestine are excreted in the feces. This decreases the need for active synthesis of bile salts by the liver cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately half of the bilirubin (a pigment derived from the breakdown of red blood cells) is a component of bile. It is converted by the intestinal flora into urobilinogen, which is a highly soluble substance. Urobilinogen is either excreted in the feces or returned to the portal circulation, where it is re-excreted into the bile. About 5% is normally absorbed into the general circulation and then excreted by the kidneys (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the flow of bile is impeded (e.g., by gallstones in the bile ducts), bilirubin does not enter the intestine. As a result, blood levels of bilirubin increase. This causes increased renal excretion of urobilinogen, which results from conversion of bilirubin in the small intestine, and decreased excretion in the stool. These changes produce many of the signs and symptoms seen in gallbladder disorders.</p>
