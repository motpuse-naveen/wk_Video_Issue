<h4 class="h4" id="s2612">Acne Vulgaris</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Acne vulgaris is a common disorder affecting susceptible pilosebaceous units (hair follicles and sebaceous glands), most commonly on the face, neck, torso, and upper arms (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dlugasch &#x0026; Story, 2021</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Thiboutot &#x0026; Zaenglein, 2019</a>). It is a chronic dermatosis characterized by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;comedones:&lt;/b&gt; the primary lesions of acne, caused by sebum blockage in the hair follicle">comedones</button></strong> (primary acne lesions), both closed (whiteheads) and open (blackheads), and by papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4094">Zaenglein, Pathy, Schlosser, et al., 2016</a>) (see <a href="c55.xhtml">Chapter 55</a>, <a href="c55-sec02.xhtml#tt55-2">Table 55-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Acne is the most commonly encountered skin condition that affects up to 80% of Americans at some time during their lives. Acne is most prevalent during adolescence among males but is more prevalent in adulthood among females. Acne is traditionally considered a skin disorder of adolescence; however, by age 45 years, up to 5% of adults report having acne (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Rao &#x0026; Chen, 2020</a>). Acne appears to stem from an interplay of genetic, hormonal, and bacterial factors (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dlugasch &#x0026; Story, 2021</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Thiboutot &#x0026; Zaenglein, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2613">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During puberty, androgens stimulate the sebaceous glands, causing them to enlarge and secrete sebum (a naturally occurring endogenous oil) that rises to the top of the hair follicle and flows out onto the skin surface. In adolescents who develop acne, androgenic stimulation produces a heightened response in the sebaceous glands, with increased sebum production and hyperkeratinization, causing sebum plug formation within the pilosebaceous ducts. Sebaceous plugging then causes a localized inflammatory response (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dlugasch &#x0026; Story, 2021</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Thiboutot &#x0026; Zaenglein, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2614">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The main lesions of acne are comedones. Closed comedones form from impacted lipids or oils and keratin that plug the dilated follicle. Closed comedones may evolve into open comedones, in which the contents of the ducts are in open communication with the external environment. The color of open comedones results from an accumulation of lipid, bacterial, and epithelial debris. Some closed comedones may rupture, resulting in an inflammatory reaction caused by leakage of follicular contents (e.g., sebum, keratin, bacteria) into the dermis. The resultant inflammation is seen clinically as erythematous papules, inflammatory pustules, and inflammatory cysts. Mild papules and cysts drain and heal without treatment. Deeper papules and cysts cause scarring of the skin (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Thiboutot &#x0026; Zaenglein, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2615">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of acne is based on the history and physical examination, evidence of lesions characteristic of acne, and age. Women may report a history of flare-ups a few days before menses. The presence of the typical comedones along with oily skin is characteristic (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Rao &#x0026; Chen, 2020</a>). Oiliness is more prominent in the midfacial area; other parts of the face may appear dry.</p>
<p class="indent">Acne vulgaris can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based upon the number and type of acne lesions, severity location and scarring. However, currently there is no consensus on the exact number of lesions that constitute mild, moderate, and severe acne (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). Generally speaking, mild acne is characterized by the presence of comedones and a few papulopustules; moderate acne is characterized by a greater number of papulopustules and comedones along with the presence of inflammatory pustules; and, severe acne is characterized by the presence of cysts (also called nodules or nodulocysts) that are greater than 5 mm in diameter (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Rao &#x0026; Chen, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2616">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of management are to reduce bacterial colonies, decrease sebaceous gland activity, prevent the follicles from becoming plugged, reduce inflammation, combat secondary infection, minimize scarring, and eliminate factors that predispose the person to acne. The therapeutic regimen depends on the type of lesion (e.g., comedones, papule, pustule, cyst). The duration of treatment depends on the extent and severity of the acne. In severe cases, treatment may extend over years.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutrition and Hygiene Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The association between diet and acne is not established. In particular, the association between acne and milk products, chocolate, and fried foods is not well defined. However, there does appear to be a correlation between foods high in refined sugars and acne; therefore, these foods should be avoided (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). In general, maintenance of good nutrition equips the immune system for effective action against bacteria and infection.</p>
<p class="indent">For mild cases of acne, washing twice a day with a cleansing soap and use of OTC products that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid (see later discussion) may be all that is required (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dlugasch &#x0026; Story, 2021</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). Oil-free cosmetics and creams should be chosen. These products are usually designated as useful for acne-prone skin.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic treatments for acne are based upon the severity of the acne (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). <a href="#tt56-5">Table 56-5</a> summarizes medications recommended to manage acne vulgaris based upon severity.</p>
<p class="h7">Topical Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Recommended OTC acne medications contain benzoyl peroxide, which is very effective at removing the sebaceous follicular plugs. Benzoyl peroxide preparations produce a rapid and sustained reduction of inflammatory lesions. They depress sebum production and promote breakdown of comedo plugs and have an antibacterial effect (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). Initially, benzoyl peroxide causes redness and scaling, but the skin usually adjusts quickly to its use. However, the skin of some people can be overly sensitive to these products, which can cause irritation or excessive dryness, especially when used with some prescribed topical medications. The patient should be instructed to discontinue use of the product if severe irritation occurs. Typically, the patient applies a gel of benzoyl peroxide once daily. In many instances, this is the only treatment needed (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">OTC salicylic acid preparations are also available for use by patients with mild acne. The effects of these agents are similar to those of benzoyl peroxide products. Although salicylic acid products have long been used by patients with acne, their efficacy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). Prescription topical agents used for years that have also not demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials include zinc, sulfur, and resorcinol; and are therefore not recommended for treatment (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Synthetic vitamin A acids, also called retinoids (e.g., tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene), are applied topically to clear the keratin plugs from the pilosebaceous ducts. The patient should be informed that symptoms may worsen during early weeks of therapy because inflammation, erythema, and peeling may occur. The patient is cautioned against sun exposure while using this topical medication because it may cause sunburn. Package insert directions should be followed carefully. Improvement may take 8 to 12 weeks. Some patients may benefit from being treated with both a retinoid and benzoyl peroxide and may be prescribed a combination topical gel (e.g., adapalene&#x2013;benzoyl peroxide) (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Topical antibiotic treatment for acne is common. Topical antibiotic agents suppress bacterial growth; reduce superficial free fatty acid levels; decrease comedones, papules, and pustules; and produce no systemic side effects (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Commonly prescribed agents include clindamycin and erythromycin. Topical combination gels that include both benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic (e.g., benzoyl erythromycin) are commonly prescribed and can be very effective treatment (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other less commonly prescribed topical agents that may be effective in treating acne vulgaris include azelaic acid and dapsone gel. Azelaic acid has comedolytic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. It may also have a lightening effect on skin that can be hyperpigmented as a consequence of acne (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). Dapsone reduces inflammatory lesions and for reasons poorly understood, seems to work better in female adult patients than in adolescent or male patients (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Systemic Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oral antibiotic agents given in small doses over a long period are very effective in treating moderate and severe acne, especially when the acne is inflammatory and results in pustules, abscesses, and scarring. Therapy may continue for months to years. Antibiotics most commonly selected are of the tetracycline class (e.g., tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>). The tetracycline family of antibiotics is contraindicated in pregnant women. Side effects of tetracyclines include photosensitivity (sensitivity to the sun), nausea, diarrhea, cutaneous infection, and vaginitis in women (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Alternative antibiotics that may be selected include erythromycin, azithromycin, and trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Oral retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin) are used with dramatic results in patients with nodular cystic acne unresponsive to conventional therapy. This may prevent scarring that can result from cyst formation. Retinoids reduce sebaceous gland size and inhibit sebum production. They also cause epidermal desquamation (shedding of the epidermis), thereby unseating and expelling existing comedones. The most common <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1834" title="1834"></span>side effect is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cheilitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the lips">cheilitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the lips). Dry and chafed skin and mucous membranes are also frequent side effects. These changes are reversible with the withdrawal of the medication. Retinoids are teratogenic, meaning that they may cause fetal defects. Effective contraceptive measures for women of childbearing age are mandatory during treatment and for about 4 to 8 weeks thereafter (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dlugasch &#x0026; Story, 2021</a>). To avoid additive toxic effects, patients are cautioned not to take vitamin A supplements while taking retinoids (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Estrogen therapy (including progesterone&#x2013;estrogen preparations) suppresses sebum production and reduces skin oiliness. It is usually reserved for young women when the acne begins somewhat later than usual and tends to flare up at certain times in the menstrual cycle. Estrogen-dominant oral contraceptive compounds may be given on a prescribed cyclic regimen (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Rao &#x0026; Chen, 2020</a>). Estrogen is not given to male patients because of the undesirable side effects such as enlargement of the breasts and decrease in body hair.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Phototherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The use of antibiotic therapy runs the risk of developing antibiotic resistance; therefore, phototherapy has been proposed as a potentially viable alternative treatment. The use of light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy using blue light (i.e., directing wavelengths of 407 to 420 nm to targeted skin) has shown preliminary promise for the treatment of mild to moderate acne. The blue light is believed to cause photoactivation of naturally occurring porphyrins, resulting in free radical formation, which causes cell membrane destruction of <em>Propionibacterium acne</em>, the common culprit in inciting comedo formation (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Ablon, 2018</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4078">Scott, Stehlik, Clark, et al., 2019</a>). To date, there have been no reported adverse effects associated with blue light phototherapy. Patients must commit time to these treatments, which may be self-administered at home twice daily for 30 to 60 minutes for 5 weeks (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Scott et al., 2019</a>). At present, the efficacy of phototherapy remains under investigation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment includes comedo extraction; injections of corticosteroids into the inflamed lesions; and incision and drainage of large, fluctuant (moving in palpable waves), nodular cystic lesions. Patients with deep scars may be treated with dermabrasion (deep abrasive therapy), in which the epidermis and some superficial dermis are removed down to the level of the scars (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Rao &#x0026; Chen, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Comedones may be removed with a comedo extractor. The site is first cleaned with alcohol. The opening of the extractor is then placed over the lesion, and direct pressure is applied to cause extrusion of the plug through the extractor. Removal of comedones leads to erythema, which may take several weeks to subside. Recurrence of comedones after extraction is common (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Rao &#x0026; Chen, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2617">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of patients with acne includes monitoring and managing potential complications of skin treatments. Major nursing activities include providing patient education, particularly in proper skin care techniques, and managing potential problems related to the skin disorder or therapy. Providing positive reassurance, listening attentively, and being sensitive to the feelings of the patient with acne are essential to the patient&#x2019;s psychological well-being and understanding of the disease and treatment plan. Having acne, particularly if it persists into adulthood, can lead to anxiety and depression (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Zaenglein et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Scarring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention of scarring is the ultimate goal of therapy. The chance of scarring increases with the severity of the grade of acne. Severe acne usually requires longer-term therapy with systemic antibiotic agents and other treatments that may include combination topical agents or isotretinoin (see Table&#x00A0;56-5). Patients should be warned that discontinuing these medications may lead to more flare-ups and increase the chance of deep scarring. Furthermore, manipulation of the comedones, papules, and pustules increases the potential for scarring.</p>
<p class="indent">When acne surgery is prescribed to extract deep-seated comedones or inflamed lesions or to incise and drain cystic lesions, the intervention itself may result in further scarring. Dermabrasion, which levels existing scar tissue, can also increase scar formation. Hyper- or hypopigmentation also may affect the tissue involved. The patient should be informed of these potential outcomes before choosing surgical intervention for acne.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to providing instructions for taking prescribed medications, the nurse advises patients to wash the face and other affected areas with mild soap and water twice a day to remove surface oils and prevent obstruction of the oil glands. Mild abrasive soaps and drying agents are prescribed to eliminate the oily feeling that troubles many patients. At the same time, patients are cautioned to avoid excessive abrasion, because it makes acne worse.</p>
<p class="indent">All forms of friction and trauma are avoided, including propping the hands against the face, rubbing the face, and wearing tight collars, helmets, and face masks. Patients are instructed to avoid manipulation of pimples or blackheads. Squeezing merely worsens the problem, because a portion of the blackhead is pushed down into the skin, which may cause the follicle to rupture. Because cosmetics, shaving creams, and lotions can aggravate acne, these should be avoided.</p>
