<h4 class="h4" id="s2089">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in patients with urinary conditions. A comprehensive health history is used to determine the appropriate laboratory and diagnostic tests. The following sections review some of the specific tests that might be used.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse should also note trends in results, because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients undergoing urologic testing or imaging studies are apprehensive, even those who have had these tests in the past. Patients frequently feel discomfort and embarrassment about such a private and personal function as voiding. Voiding in the presence of others can frequently cause guarding, a natural reflex that inhibits voiding due to situational anxiety. Because the outcomes of these studies determine the plan of care, the nurse must help the patient relax by providing as much privacy and explanation about the procedure as possible (see <a href="#ct47-4">Chart&#x00A0;47-4</a>). In addition, <a href="#ct47-5">Chart&#x00A0;47-5</a> provides a plan of nursing care for the patient undergoing diagnostic testing.</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Before and After Urodynamic Testing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient on what to expect before, during, and after the procedure:</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Preprocedure</p>
<p class="BoxBL1single"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An in-depth interview will be conducted. Questions related to your urologic symptoms and voiding habits will be asked.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">During the Procedure</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You will be asked to describe sensations felt.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You might be asked to change positions (e.g., from supine to sitting or standing).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You may be asked to cough or perform the Valsalva maneuver (bear down).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You will probably need to have one or two urethral catheters inserted so that bladder pressure and bladder filling can be measured. Another catheter may be placed in the rectum or vagina to measure abdominal pressure.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You may also have electrodes (surface, wire, or needle) placed in the perianal area for electromyography. This may be uncomfortable initially during insertion and later during position changes.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Your bladder will be filled through the urethral catheter one or more times.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">After the Procedure</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You may experience urinary frequency, urgency, or dysuria from the urethral catheters. Avoid caffeinated, carbonated, and alcoholic beverages because they can further irritate the bladder. These symptoms usually decrease or subside by the day after the procedure.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You might notice slight hematuria (blood-tinged urine) right after the procedure (especially in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia). Drinking fluids will help to clear the hematuria.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the urinary meatus is irritated, a warm sitz bath may be helpful.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be alert to signs of a urinary tract infection. Contact your primary provider if you experience fever, chills, lower back pain, or continued dysuria and hematuria.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you receive an antibiotic medication before the procedure, you should continue taking the complete course of medication after the procedure. This is a measure to prevent infection.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2090">Urinalysis and Urine Culture</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The urinalysis provides important clinical information about kidney function and helps diagnose other diseases, such as diabetes. The urine culture determines whether bacteria are present in the urine, as well as their strains and concentration. Urine culture and sensitivity also identify the antimicrobial therapy that is best suited for the particular strains identified, taking into consideration the antibiotic agents that have the best rate of resolution in that particular geographic region. Appropriate evaluation of any abnormality can assist in detecting serious underlying diseases.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Significance of Findings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several abnormalities, such as hematuria and proteinuria, produce no symptoms but may be detected during a routine urinalysis using a dipstick. Normally, about one million RBCs pass into the urine daily, which is equivalent to one to three RBCs per high-power field. Hematuria (more than three RBCs per high-power field) can develop from an abnormality anywhere along the genitourinary tract and is more common in women than in men. Common causes include acute infection (cystitis, urethritis, or prostatitis), renal calculi, and neoplasm. Other causes include systemic disorders, such as bleeding disorders; malignant lesions; and medications, such as warfarin and heparin. Although hematuria may initially be detected using a dipstick test, further evaluation is necessary and more accurate with a 24-hour collection (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Proteinuria may be a benign finding, or it may signify serious disease. Occasional loss of up to 150 mg/day of protein in the urine, primarily albumin and Tamm&#x2013;Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin), is considered normal and usually does not require further evaluation. A dipstick examination, which can detect from 30 to 1000 mg/dL of protein, should be used as a screening test only, because urine concentration, pH, hematuria, and radiocontrast materials all affect the results. Because dipstick analysis does not detect protein concentrations of less than 30 mg/dL, the test cannot be used for early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria (excretion of 20 to 200 mg/dL of protein in the urine) is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy. Common benign causes of transient proteinuria are fever, strenuous exercise, and prolonged standing.</p>
<p class="indent">Causes of persistent proteinuria include glomerular diseases, malignancies, collagen diseases, diabetes, preeclampsia, hypothyroidism, heart failure, exposure to heavy metals, and the use of medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (<a href="#bib3493">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2091">Specific Gravity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Specific gravity is an expression of the degree of concentration of the urine that measures the density of a solution compared to the density of distilled water, which is 1.000. Specific gravity is altered by the presence of blood, protein, and casts in the urine. The normal range of urine specific gravity is 1.005 to 1.025 (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib3493">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Methods for determination of specific gravity include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Multiple-test dipstick (most common method), with a specific reagent area for specific gravity</span></li>
<li><span>Urinometer (least accurate method), in which urine is placed in a small cylinder and the urinometer is floated in the urine; a specific gravity reading is obtained at the meniscus level of the urine</span></li>
<li><span>Refractometer, an instrument used in a laboratory setting, which measures differences in the speed of light passing through air and the urine sample; this is the most accurate test</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Urine specific gravity depends largely on hydration status. When fluid intake decreases, specific gravity normally increases. With high fluid intake, specific gravity decreases. In patients with kidney disease, urine specific gravity does not vary with fluid intake, and the patient&#x2019;s urine is said to have a fixed specific gravity. Disorders or conditions that cause decreased urine specific gravity include diabetes insipidus, glomerulonephritis, and severe renal damage. Those that can cause increased specific gravity include diabetes, nephritis, and fluid deficit.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2092">Osmolality</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Osmolality is the most accurate measurement of the kidney&#x2019;s ability to dilute and concentrate urine. It measures the number of solute particles in a kilogram of water. Serum and urine osmolality are measured simultaneously to assess the body&#x2019;s fluid status. In healthy adults, serum osmolality is 275 to 290&#x00A0;mOsm/kg, and normal urine osmolality is 200 to 800&#x00A0;mOsm/kg. For a 24-hour urine sample, the normal value is 300 to 900 mOsm/kg (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2093">Renal Function Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Renal function tests are used to evaluate the severity of kidney disease and to assess the status of the patient&#x2019;s kidney function. These tests also provide information about the effectiveness of the kidney in carrying out its excretory function. Renal function test results may be within normal limits until the GFR is reduced to less than 50% of normal. Renal function can be assessed most accurately if several tests are performed and their results are analyzed together. Common tests of renal function include renal concentration tests, creatinine clearance, and serum creatinine and blood <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urea nitrogen:&lt;/b&gt; end product of protein metabolism (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; blood urea nitrogen [BUN])">urea nitrogen</button></strong> (end product of protein metabolism) levels (see Table&#x00A0;47-5).</p>
<p class="indent">Other tests for evaluating renal function that may be helpful include serum electrolyte levels as well as urinary biomarkers to detect acute kidney injury (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>) (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2094">Diagnostic Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are a wide range of diagnostic studies used for the assessment of kidney and urinary function.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An x-ray study of the abdomen or kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) may be performed to delineate the size, shape, and position of the kidneys and to reveal urinary system abnormalities (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Ultrasonography is a noninvasive procedure that uses sound waves passed into the body through a transducer to detect abnormalities of internal tissues and organs. Abnormalities such as fluid accumulation, masses, congenital malformations, changes in organ size, and obstructions can be identified. During the test, the lower abdomen and genitalia may need to be exposed. Ultrasonography requires a full bladder; therefore, fluid intake is encouraged before the procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bladder Ultrasonography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bladder ultrasonography is a noninvasive method of measuring urine volume in the bladder. It may be indicated for urinary frequency, inability to void after removal of an indwelling urinary catheter, measurement of postvoiding residual urine volume, inability to void postoperatively, or assessment of the need for catheterization during the initial stages of an intermittent catheterization training program. Portable, battery-operated devices are available for bedside use. The scan head is placed on the patient&#x2019;s abdomen and directed toward the bladder (see <a href="#ff47-8">Fig.&#x00A0;47-8</a>). These devices automatically calculate and display an estimated urine volume (<a href="#bib3493">Taylor, Lynn, &#x0026; Bartlett, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are noninvasive techniques that provide excellent cross-sectional views of the anatomy of the kidney and urinary tract. They are used to evaluate genitourinary masses, nephrolithiasis, chronic renal infections, renal or urinary tract trauma, metastatic disease, and soft tissue abnormalities. Occasionally, an oral or intravenous (IV) radiopaque contrast agent is used in CT scanning to enhance visualization.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preparation includes educating the patient about relaxation techniques and explaining that they will be able to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1550" title="1550"></span>communicate with the staff by means of a microphone located inside the scanner. Many MRI suites provide headphones so that patients can listen to the music of their choice during the procedure. Nursing care guidelines for patient preparation and precautions for any imaging procedure that requires a contrast agent (contrast medium) are explained in <a href="#ct47-6">Chart&#x00A0;47-6</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the patient enters the room where the MRI is to be performed, all metal objects and credit cards (the magnetic field can erase them) are removed. This includes medication patches (e.g., nicotine and nitroglycerin) that have a metal backing, which can cause burns if they are not removed. No metal objects (e.g., oxygen tanks, ventilators, stethoscopes) may be brought into the MRI room. The magnetic field is so strong that any metal-containing items will be pulled toward the magnet, causing severe injury and possible death. Patients with any type of cardiac implantable electronic device need to be screened to see if it is safe for the patient to undergo MRI (<a href="#bib3490">Indik, Gimbel, Abe, et al., 2017</a>). A patient history is obtained to determine the presence of any internal objects containing metal such as aneurysm clips, orthopedic hardware, artificial heart valves, or intrauterine devices. These objects could malfunction, be dislodged, or heat up as they absorb energy. Cochlear implants are inactivated by MRI; therefore, other imaging procedures are considered. A sedative agent may be prescribed, because claustrophobia is a problem for some patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to MRI of the urinary system, the patient needs to be informed to avoid alcohol, caffeine-containing beverages, and smoking for at least 2 hours and food for at least 1 hour prior to the scan. Patients should continue taking their usual medication, except for iron supplements, which can interfere with the imaging (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nuclear Scans</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nuclear scans require injection of a radioisotope (a technetium 99m&#x2013;labeled compound or iodine 123 [<sup>123</sup>I] hippurate) into the circulatory system; the isotope is then monitored as it moves through the blood vessels of the kidneys. A scintillation camera is placed behind the kidney with the patient in a supine, prone, or seated position. Hypersensitivity to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1551" title="1551"></span>radioisotope is rare. The technetium scan provides information about kidney perfusion. The <sup>123</sup>I-hippurate renal scan provides information about kidney function, such as GFR.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Patient Care During Urologic Testing with Contrast Agents</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">For some patients, contrast agents are nephrotoxic and allergenic. Emergency equipment and medications should be available in case of an anaphylactic reaction to the contrast agent. Emergency supplies include epinephrine, corticosteroids, vasopressors, oxygen, and airway and suction equipment.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The following guidelines can help the nurse respond quickly in the event of a problem.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Actions for Patient Preparation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain the patient&#x2019;s allergy history with emphasis on allergy to iodine, shellfish, and other seafood, because many contrast agents contain iodine.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Notify primary provider and radiologist if the patient is allergic or suspected to be allergic to iodine.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain health history. Contrast agents should be used with great caution in older patients and in patients who have multiple myeloma, renal impairment, or volume depletion.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain medication history. Nephrotoxic medications such as vancomycin, amphotericin B, metformin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be discontinued before contrast media administration.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The use of both nonionic low osmolar contrast media (LOCM, e.g., iohexol) and ionic high osmolar contrast media (HOCM, e.g., diatrizoate), is indicated in patients with renal impairment and other risk factors to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Check kidney function in patients who are at risk. Patients should receive IV hydration prior to the procedure.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inform the patient that they may experience a temporary feeling of warmth, flushing of the face, and an unusual flavor (similar to that of seafood) in the mouth when the contrast agent is infused.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Actions During and Post Procedure</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Monitor patient closely for allergic reaction, and monitor urine output.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Maintain hydration status.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Nuclear scans are used to evaluate acute and chronic kidney injury, renal masses, and blood flow before and after kidney transplantation. The radioisotope is injected at a specified time to achieve the proper concentration in the kidneys. After the procedure is completed, the patient is encouraged to drink fluids to promote excretion of the radioisotope by the kidneys.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intravenous Urography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">IV urography includes various tests such as excretory urography, intravenous pyelography (IVP), and infusion drip pyelography. A radiopaque contrast agent is given IV. An IVP shows the kidneys, ureter, and bladder via x-ray imaging as the dye moves through the upper and then the lower urinary system. A nephrotomogram may be carried out as part of the study to visualize different layers of the kidney and the diffuse structures within each layer and to differentiate solid masses or lesions from cysts in the kidneys or urinary tract.</p>
<p class="indent">IV urography may be used as the initial assessment of many suspected urologic conditions, especially lesions in the kidneys and ureters. It also provides an approximate estimate of renal function. After the contrast agent (sodium diatrizoate or meglumine diatrizoate) is given IV, multiple x-rays are obtained to visualize drainage structures in the upper and lower urinary systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Infusion drip pyelography requires IV infusion of a large volume of a dilute contrast agent to opacify the renal parenchyma and fill the urinary tract. This examination method is useful when prolonged opacification of the drainage structures is desired so that tomograms (body-section radiography) can be made. Images are obtained at specified intervals after the start of the infusion. These images show the filled and distended collecting system. The patient preparation is the same as for excretory urography, except fluids are not restricted.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Retrograde Pyelography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In retrograde pyelography, catheters are advanced through the ureters into the renal pelvis by means of cystoscopy. A contrast agent is then injected. Retrograde pyelography is usually performed if IV urography provides inadequate visualization of the collecting systems. It may also be used before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and in patients with urologic cancer who need follow-up and have an allergy to IV contrast agents. Possible complications include infection, hematuria, and perforation of the ureter. Retrograde pyelography is used infrequently because of improved techniques in excretory urography.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cystography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cystography aids in evaluating vesicoureteral reflux (backflow of urine from the bladder into one or both ureters) and in assessing for bladder injury. A catheter is inserted into the bladder, and a contrast agent is instilled to outline the bladder wall. The contrast agent may leak through a small bladder perforation stemming from bladder injury, but such leakage is usually harmless. Cystography can also be performed with simultaneous pressure recordings inside the bladder.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Voiding Cystourethrography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Voiding cystourethrography uses fluoroscopy to visualize the lower urinary tract and assess urine storage in the bladder. It is commonly used as a diagnostic tool to identify vesicoureteral reflux. A urethral catheter is inserted, and a contrast agent is instilled into the bladder. When the bladder is full and the patient feels the urge to void, the catheter is removed, and the patient voids.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Renal Angiography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A renal angiogram, or renal arteriogram, provides an image of the renal arteries. The femoral (or axillary) artery is pierced with a needle, and a catheter is threaded up through the femoral and iliac arteries into the aorta or renal artery. A contrast agent is injected to opacify the renal arterial supply. Angiography is used to evaluate renal blood flow in suspected renal trauma, to differentiate renal cysts from tumors, and to evaluate hypertension. It is used preoperatively for renal transplantation.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before the procedure, a laxative may be prescribed to evacuate the colon so that unobstructed x-rays can be obtained. Injection sites (groin for femoral approach or axilla for axillary approach) may be shaved. The peripheral pulse sites (radial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis) are marked for easy access during postprocedural assessment. See <a href="#ct47-6">Chart&#x00A0;47-6</a> for considerations for the patient receiving a contrast agent.</p>
<p class="indent">After the procedure, vital signs are monitored until stable. If the axillary artery was the injection site, blood pressure measurements are taken on the opposite arm. The injection site is examined for swelling and hematoma. Peripheral pulses are palpated, and the color and temperature of the involved extremity are noted and compared with those of the uninvolved extremity. Cold compresses may be applied to the injection site to decrease edema and pain. Possible complications include hematoma formation, arterial thrombosis or dissection, false aneurysm formation, and altered renal function.</p>
<h6 class="h6">MAG3 Renogram</h6>
<p class="nonindent">This scan is used to further evaluate kidney function in some centers by permitting visualization of renal clearance (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). The patient is given an injection containing a small amount of radioactive material, which will show how the kidneys are functioning. The patient needs to lie still for about 35 minutes while special cameras take images (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2095">Urologic Endoscopic Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Endourology, or urologic endoscopic procedures, can be performed in one of two ways: using a cystoscope inserted into the urethra, or percutaneously, through a small incision.</p>
<p class="indent">The cystoscopic examination is used to directly visualize the urethra and bladder. The cystoscope, which is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, has an optical lens system that provides a magnified, illuminated view of the bladder (see <a href="#ff47-9">Fig.&#x00A0;47-9</a>). The use of high-intensity light and interchangeable lenses allows excellent visualization and permits still and motion pictures to be taken. The cystoscope is manipulated to allow complete visualization of the urethra and bladder <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1552" title="1552"></span>as well as the ureteral orifices and prostatic urethra. Small ureteral catheters can be passed through the cystoscope for assessment of the ureters and the pelvis of each kidney.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff47-9">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff47-9.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff47-9.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;47-9 &#x2022;</span> Cystoscopic examination. A rigid or semirigid cystoscope is introduced into the bladder. The upper cord is an electric line for the light at the distal end of the cystoscope. The lower tubing leads from a reservoir of sterile irrigant that is used to inflate the bladder.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The cystoscope also allows the urologist to obtain a urine specimen from each kidney to evaluate its function. Cup forceps can be inserted through the cystoscope for biopsy. Calculi may be removed from the urethra, bladder, and ureter using cystoscopy. If a lower tract cystoscopy is performed, the patient is usually conscious, and the procedure is usually no more uncomfortable than a catheterization. To minimize posttest urethral discomfort, viscous lidocaine is given several minutes before the study. If the cystoscopy includes examination of the upper tracts, a sedative agent may be given before the procedure. General anesthesia is usually given to ensure that there are no involuntary muscle spasms when the scope is being passed through the ureters or kidneys.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse describes the procedure to the patient and family to prepare them and to allay their fears. If an upper cystoscopy is to be performed, the patient is usually restricted to nothing by mouth (NPO) for several hours beforehand.</p>
<p class="indent">Postprocedural management is directed at relieving any discomfort resulting from the examination. Some burning on voiding, blood-tinged urine, and urinary frequency from trauma to the mucous membranes can be expected. Moist heat to the lower abdomen and warm sitz baths are helpful in relieving pain and relaxing the muscles.</p>
<p class="indent">After a cystoscopic examination, the patient with obstructive pathology may experience urine retention if the instruments used during the examination caused edema. The nurse carefully monitors the patient with prostatic hyperplasia for urine retention. Warm sitz baths and antispasmodic medication, such as flavoxate, may be prescribed to relieve temporary urine retention caused by poor relaxation of the urinary sphincter; however, intermittent catheterization may be necessary for a few hours after the examination. The nurse monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of UTI. Because edema of the urethra secondary to local trauma may obstruct urine flow, the patient is also monitored for signs and symptoms of obstruction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2096">Biopsy</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Renal and Ureteral Brush Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Brush biopsy techniques provide specific information when abnormal x-ray findings of the ureter or renal pelvis raise questions about whether a defect is a tumor, a stone, a blood clot, or an artifact. First, a cystoscopic examination is conducted. Then, a ureteral catheter is introduced, followed by a biopsy brush that is passed through the catheter. The suspected lesion is brushed back and forth to obtain cells and surface tissue fragments for histologic analysis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Kidney Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Biopsy of the kidney is used to help diagnose and evaluate the extent of kidney disease. Indications for biopsy include unexplained acute kidney injury, persistent proteinuria or hematuria, transplant rejection, and glomerulopathies. A small section of renal cortex is obtained either percutaneously (needle biopsy) or by open biopsy through a small flank incision. Before the biopsy is carried out, coagulation studies are conducted to identify any risk of postbiopsy bleeding. Contraindications to kidney biopsy include bleeding tendencies, uncontrolled hypertension, sepsis, a solitary kidney, large polycystic kidneys, kidney neoplasm, UTI, and morbid obesity.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may be prescribed a fasting regimen 6 to 8 hours before the test. An IV line is established. A urine specimen is obtained and saved for comparison with the postbiopsy specimen.</p>
<p class="indent">If a needle biopsy is to be performed, the patient is instructed to breathe in and hold that breath (to prevent the kidney from moving) while the needle is being inserted. The sedated patient is placed in a prone position with a sandbag under the abdomen. The skin at the biopsy site is infiltrated with a local anesthetic agent. The biopsy needle is introduced just inside the renal capsule of the outer quadrant of the kidney. The location of the needle may be confirmed by fluoroscopy or by ultrasound, in which case a special probe is used.</p>
<p class="indent">With open biopsy, a small incision is made over the kidney, allowing direct visualization. Preparation for an open biopsy is similar to that for any major abdominal surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After a biopsy procedure, nursing care includes monitoring vital signs to detect signs and symptoms of bleeding or infection (<a href="#bib3493">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). The nurse should assess for other signs and symptoms of internal bleeding such as pallor, dizziness, and flank or back pain. IV fluids may be given to help clear the kidneys and prevent clot formation. Urine may contain blood (usually clearing in 24 to 48 hours) from oozing at the site. Bed rest should be maintained and pressure dressings applied for prescribed periods of time to control bleeding. Puncture sites should be examined for signs and symptoms of infection. Analgesic agents should be given as prescribed and needed for pain.</p>
