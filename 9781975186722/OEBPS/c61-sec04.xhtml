<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m13">Preoperative Management</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2947">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative diagnostic procedures may include a CT scan to demonstrate the lesion and show the degree of surrounding brain edema, the ventricular size, and the displacement. An MRI scan provides information similar to that of a CT scan with improved tissue contrast, resolution, and anatomic definition. Cerebral angiography may be used to study a tumor&#x2019;s blood supply or obtain information about vascular lesions. Transcranial Doppler flow studies are used to evaluate the blood flow within intracranial blood vessels.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may be prescribed an anticonvulsant medication such as phenytoin, levetiracetam, or a phenytoin metabolite (fosphenytoin sodium) before surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;seizures:&lt;/b&gt; paroxysmal transient disturbance of the brain resulting from a discharge of abnormal electrical activity">seizures</button></strong> (paroxysmal transient disturbance of the brain resulting from a discharge of abnormal electrical activity) (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Recent research suggests that anticonvulsant medications should not be used routinely, but only when the patient experiences seizures (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4327">Mirian, Pedersen, Sabers, et al., 2019</a>). Before surgery, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone may be given to reduce cerebral edema if the patient has a brain tumor. Fluids may be restricted. A hyperosmotic agent (mannitol) and a diuretic agent such as furosemide may be administered IV immediately before and sometimes during surgery if the patient tends to retain fluid, as do many who have intracranial dysfunction. Antibiotic agents may be given if there is a chance of cerebral contamination; diazepam or lorazepam may be prescribed before surgery to allay anxiety.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2948">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The preoperative assessment serves as a baseline against which postoperative status and recovery are compared. This assessment includes evaluating the LOC and responsiveness to stimuli and identifying any neurologic deficits, such as paralysis, visual dysfunction, alterations in personality or speech, and bladder and bowel disorders. Baseline distal and proximal motor strength in both upper and lower extremities is tested and recorded. See <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a> for a discussion of the testing of motor function.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s understanding of and reactions to the anticipated surgical procedure and its possible sequelae are assessed, as is the availability of support systems for the patient and family. Adequate preparation for surgery, with attention to the patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional status, can reduce the risk of anxiety, fear, and postoperative complications. The patient is assessed for neurologic deficits and their potential impact after surgery. For motor deficits or weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs, trochanter rolls are applied to the extremities, and the feet are positioned against a footboard or the ankles are supported in a neutral position with orthotic boots. A patient who can ambulate is encouraged to do so. If the patient is aphasic, writing materials or picture and word cards showing the bedpan, glass of water, blanket, and other frequently used items may help improve communication.</p>
<p class="indent">Preparation of the patient and family includes providing education about what to expect during and after surgery. The patient should plan to shower and wash their hair prior to surgery using the preferred cleansing solution. Hair is removed with the use of clippers and the surgical site prepared immediately before surgery (usually in the operating room), and IV antibiotics are given 1 hour prior to the incision to decrease the chance of infection (American Association of Neuroscience Nurses [AANN], 2016b). An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted in the operating room to drain the bladder during the administration of diuretic agents and to permit monitoring of urinary output. The patient may have an arterial line placed for monitoring of pressures after surgery. The large head dressing applied after surgery may impair hearing temporarily. Vision may be limited if the eyes are swollen shut. If a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube remains in place, the patient will be unable to speak until the tube is removed, so an alternative method of communication must be established.</p>
<p class="indent">An altered cognitive state may make the patient unaware of the impending surgery. Even so, encouragement and attention to the patient&#x2019;s needs are necessary. Whatever the state of awareness of the patient, the family needs reassurance and support, because they usually recognize the seriousness of brain surgery.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m14">Postoperative Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperatively, an arterial line may be in place to monitor and manage blood pressure. The patient may be intubated and may receive supplemental oxygen therapy. Ongoing postoperative management is aimed at detecting and reducing cerebral edema, relieving pain and preventing seizures, and monitoring ICP and neurologic status.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2011</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2012" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2012">p. 2012</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2949">Reducing Cerebral Edema</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medications to reduce cerebral edema include mannitol, which increases serum osmolality and draws free water from areas of the brain (with an intact blood&#x2013;brain barrier). The fluid is then excreted by osmotic diuresis. Dexamethasone may be administered IV every 6 hours for 24 to 72 hours; the route is changed to oral as soon as possible, and the dosage is typically tapered over 5 to 7 days; some patients may require an extended taper (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2950">Relieving Pain and Preventing Seizures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acetaminophen is usually prescribed for temperatures exceeding 37.5&#x00B0;C (99.6&#x00B0;F) (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rincon, 2018</a>) and for mild pain. The patient usually has a headache after a craniotomy as a result of stretching and irritation of nerves in the scalp during surgery. Codeine, administered IV or orally, is often sufficient to relieve headache. Morphine sulfate may also be used in the management of postoperative pain in patients who have undergone a craniotomy with the goal of a patient reporting acceptable pain level (AANN, 2016b).</p>
<p class="indent">Anticonvulsant medication (phenytoin, levetiracetam) is often prescribed prophylactically for patients who have undergone supratentorial craniotomy because of the high risk of seizures after these procedures (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Serum levels are monitored to check that the medication levels are within the therapeutic range.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2951">Monitoring Intracranial Pressure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A patient undergoing intracranial surgery may have an ICP or cerebral oxygenation monitor inserted during surgery. Strict adherence to written protocols for managing these systems is essential, as discussed earlier, for preventing infection and managing ICP. The system is removed after the ICP or cerebral oxygenation is normal and stable. The neurosurgeon must be notified immediately if the system is not functioning.</p>

<p class="processppara">After surgery, the frequency of postoperative monitoring is based on the patient&#x2019;s clinical status. Assessing respiratory function is essential, because even a small degree of hypoxia can increase cerebral ischemia. The respiratory rate and pattern are monitored, and arterial blood gas values are assessed frequently. Fluctuations in vital signs are carefully monitored and documented, because they may indicate increased ICP. The patient&#x2019;s temperature is measured to assess for hyperthermia secondary to infection or damage to the hypothalamus. Neurologic checks are made frequently to detect increased ICP resulting from cerebral edema or bleeding. A change in LOC or response to stimuli may be the first sign of increasing ICP.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The surgical dressing is inspected for evidence of bleeding and CSF drainage. The incision is monitored for redness, tenderness, bulging, separation, or foul odor. Sodium retention may occur in the immediate postoperative period. Serum and urine electrolytes, BUN, blood glucose, weight, and clinical status are monitored. Intake and output are measured in view of losses associated with fever, respiration, and CSF drainage. The nurse must be alert to the development of complications; all assessments are carried out with these problems in mind. Seizures are a potential complication, and any seizure activity is carefully recorded and reported. Restlessness may occur as the patient becomes more responsive, or restlessness may be caused by pain, confusion, hypoxia, or other stimuli.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<span class="small">URSING</span> D<span class="small">IAGNOSES</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for ineffective tissue perfusion associated with cerebral edema</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for impaired thermoregulation associated with damage to the hypothalamus, dehydration, and infection</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired gas exchange associated with hypoventilation, aspiration, and immobility</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Difficulty coping associated with sensory perception changes due to periorbital edema, head dressing, endotracheal tube, and effects of ICP</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disturbed body image associated with change in appearance or physical disabilities</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Other nursing diagnoses may include impaired communication (aphasia) associated with insult to brain tissue and high risk for impaired skin integrity associated with immobility, pressure, and incontinence; impaired mobility associated with a neurologic deficit secondary to the neurosurgical procedure or to the underlying disorder may also occur.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<span class="small">OLLABORATIVE</span> P<span class="small">ROBLEMS</span>/P<span class="small">OTENTIAL</span> C<span class="small">OMPLICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Increased ICP</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Bleeding and hypovolemic shock</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Seizures</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include maintaining or restoring neurologic homeostasis to improve cerebral tissue perfusion, adequate thermoregulation, normal ventilation and gas exchange, ability to cope with sensory deprivation, adaptation to changes in body image, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">AINTAINING</span> C<span class="small">EREBRAL</span> T<span class="small">ISSUE</span> P<span class="small">ERFUSION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Attention to the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status is essential, because even slight decreases in the oxygen level (hypoxia) or slight increases in the carbon dioxide level (hypercarbia) can affect cerebral perfusion, the clinical course, and the patient&#x2019;s outcome. The endotracheal tube is left in place until the patient shows signs of awakening and has adequate spontaneous ventilation, as evaluated clinically and by arterial blood gas analysis. Secondary brain damage can result from impaired cerebral oxygenation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Some degree of cerebral edema occurs after brain surgery; it tends to peak 24 to 36 hours after surgery, potentially producing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2013" title="2013"></span>decreased responsiveness on the second postoperative day. The control of cerebral edema was discussed earlier. Nursing strategies used to control factors that may raise ICP were presented in the previous Nursing Process section on increased ICP. Intraventricular drainage is carefully monitored, using strict asepsis when any part of the system is handled.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Vital signs and neurologic status (LOC and responsiveness, pupillary and motor responses) are assessed every 15 to 60 minutes. Extreme head rotation is avoided, because this raises ICP. After supratentorial surgery, the patient is placed on their back or side (on the unoperated side if a large lesion was removed) with one pillow under the head. The head of the bed may be elevated 30 degrees, depending on the level of the ICP and the neurosurgeon&#x2019;s preference. After posterior fossa (infratentorial) surgery, the patient is kept flat on one side (off the back) with the head on a small, firm pillow. The patient may be turned on either side, keeping the neck in a neutral position. When the patient is being turned, the body should be turned as a unit to prevent placing strain on the incision and possibly tearing the sutures. The head of the bed may be elevated slowly as tolerated by the patient.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s position is changed every 2 hours, and skin care is given frequently. During position changes, care is taken to prevent disruption of the ICP monitoring system. A turning sheet or lift sling placed under the patient&#x2019;s head to midthigh makes it easier to move and turn the patient safely.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EGULATING</span> T<span class="small">EMPERATURE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Moderate temperature elevation can be expected after intracranial surgery because of the reaction to blood at the operative site or in the subarachnoid space. Injury to the hypothalamic centers that regulate body temperature can occur during surgery. Fever is treated vigorously to combat the effect of an elevated temperature on brain metabolism and function.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing interventions include monitoring the patient&#x2019;s temperature and using the following measures to reduce body temperature: removing blankets, placing ice packs, and administering prescribed antipyretics to reduce fever (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rincon, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Conversely, hypothermia may be seen after lengthy neurosurgical procedures. Therefore, frequent measurements of rectal temperatures are necessary. Rewarming should occur slowly to prevent shivering, which increases cellular oxygen demands.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> G<span class="small">AS</span> E<span class="small">XCHANGE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient undergoing neurosurgery is at risk for impaired gas exchange and pulmonary infections due to immobility, immunosuppression, decreased LOC, and fluid restriction. Immobility compromises the respiratory system by causing pooling and stasis of secretions in dependent areas and the development of atelectasis. The patient whose fluid intake is restricted may be more vulnerable to atelectasis as a result of inability to expectorate thickened secretions. Pneumonia can develop due to aspiration and restricted mobility.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Repositioning the patient every 2 hours helps to mobilize pulmonary secretions and prevent stasis. After the patient regains consciousness, additional measures to expand collapsed alveoli can be instituted, such as yawning, sighing, deep breathing, incentive spirometry, and coughing (unless contraindicated). If necessary, the oropharynx and trachea are suctioned to remove secretions that cannot be raised by coughing; however, coughing and suctioning increase ICP. Therefore, suctioning should be used cautiously. Increasing the humidity in the oxygen delivery system may help to loosen secretions. The nurse and the respiratory therapist work together to monitor the effects of chest physiotherapy.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<span class="small">OPING WITH</span> S<span class="small">ENSORY</span> D<span class="small">EPRIVATION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Periorbital edema is a common consequence of intracranial surgery, because fluid drains into the dependent periorbital areas when the patient has been positioned in a prone position during surgery. A hematoma may form under the scalp and spread down to the orbit, producing an area of ecchymosis (black eye).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Before surgery, the patient and family should be informed that one or both eyes may be edematous temporarily after surgery. After surgery, elevating the head of the bed (if not contraindicated) and applying cold compresses over the eyes will help reduce the edema. The surgeon is notified if periorbital edema increases significantly, because this may indicate that a postoperative clot is developing or that there is increasing ICP and poor venous drainage. Health care personnel should announce their presence when entering the room to avoid startling the patient whose vision is impaired due to periorbital edema or neurologic deficits.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Additional factors that can affect sensation include a bulky head dressing, the presence of an endotracheal tube, and effects of increased ICP. The first postoperative dressing change is usually performed by the neurosurgeon. In the absence of bleeding or a CSF leak, every effort is made to minimize the size of the head dressing. If the patient requires an endotracheal tube for mechanical ventilation, every effort is made to extubate the patient as soon as clinical signs indicate it is possible. The patient is monitored closely for the effects of elevated ICP.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<span class="small">NHANCING</span> S<span class="small">ELF</span>-I<span class="small">MAGE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is encouraged to verbalize feelings and frustrations about any change in appearance. Nursing support is based on the patient&#x2019;s reactions and feelings. Factual information may need to be provided if the patient has misconceptions about puffiness about the face, periorbital bruising, and hair loss. Attention to grooming, the use of the patient&#x2019;s own clothing, and covering the head with a turban (and later a wig until hair growth occurs) are encouraged. Social interaction with close friends, family, and hospital personnel may increase the patient&#x2019;s sense of self-worth.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The family and social support system can be of assistance while the patient recovers from surgery.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ONITORING AND</span> M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> P<span class="small">OTENTIAL</span> C<span class="small">OMPLICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse must be vigilant for complications that may develop within hours of surgery and require close collaboration with the neurosurgeon. These include increased ICP, bleeding and hypovolemic shock, altered fluid and electrolyte balance (e.g., water intoxication, diabetes insipidus), infection, identification of a CSF leak, and seizures.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Monitoring for Increased Intracranial Pressure and Bleeding.</span> Increased ICP and bleeding are life-threatening to the patient who has undergone intracranial surgery. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2014" title="2014"></span>following points must be kept in mind when caring for any patient who has undergone such surgery:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An increase in blood pressure and decrease in pulse with respiratory failure may indicate increased ICP.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An accumulation of blood under the bone flap (extradural, subdural, or intracerebral hematoma) may pose a threat to life. A clot must be suspected in any patient who does not awaken as expected or whose condition deteriorates. An intracranial hematoma is suspected if the patient has any new postoperative neurologic deficits (especially a dilated pupil on the operative side). In these circumstances, the patient is returned to the operating room immediately for evacuation of the clot, if indicated.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cerebral edema, infarction, metabolic disturbances, and hydrocephalus are conditions that may mimic the clinical manifestations of a clot.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is monitored closely for indicators of complications, and early signs and trends in clinical status are reported to the surgeon. Treatments are initiated promptly, and the nurse assists in evaluating the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. The nurse also provides support to the patient and family.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>If signs and symptoms of increased ICP occur, efforts to decrease the ICP are initiated: alignment of the head in a neutral position without flexion to promote venous drainage, elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees (when prescribed), administration of mannitol (an osmotic diuretic), and possible administration of pharmacologic paralyzing agents.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Managing Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances.</span> Fluid and electrolyte imbalances may occur because of the patient&#x2019;s underlying condition and its management or as complications of surgery. These disturbances can contribute to the development of cerebral edema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The postoperative fluid regimen depends on the type of neurosurgical procedure and is determined on an individual basis. The volume and composition of fluids are adjusted based on daily serum electrolyte values, along with fluid intake and output. Fluids may have to be restricted in patients with cerebral edema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Oral fluids are usually resumed after the first 24 hours. The presence of gag and swallowing reflexes must be checked before initiation of oral fluids. Some patients with posterior fossa tumors have impaired swallowing, so fluids may need to be given by alternative routes. The patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of nausea and vomiting as the diet is progressed (AANN, 2016b).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients undergoing surgery for brain tumors often receive large doses of corticosteroids and are at risk for hyperglycemia. Serum glucose levels are measured every 4 to 6 hours, and sliding scale insulin is prescribed as needed. These patients are prone to stress ulcers, so histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub> blockers) or proton pump inhibitors are prescribed to suppress the secretion of gastric acid. Patients also are monitored for bleeding and assessed for gastric pain.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the surgical site is near to (or causes edema to) the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, the patient may develop symptoms of diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive urinary output, elevated serum osmolality, decreased urine osmolality, hypernatremia, and a low urine specific gravity. The urine specific gravity is measured hourly, and fluid intake and output are monitored. Fluid replacement must compensate for urine output, and serum potassium levels must be monitored.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">SIADH, which results in water retention with hyponatremia and serum hypo-osmolality, occurs in a wide variety of CNS disorders (e.g., brain tumor, head trauma) causing fluid disturbances. Nursing management includes careful intake and output measurements, specific gravity determinations of urine, and monitoring of serum and urine electrolyte levels while following directives for fluid restriction. SIADH is usually self-limited.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Preventing Infection.</span> The patient undergoing neurosurgery is at risk for infection associated with the neurosurgical procedure (brain exposure, bone exposure, wound hematomas) and the presence of IV and arterial lines for fluid administration and monitoring. Risk for infection is increased in patients who undergo lengthy intracranial operations and in those who have external ventricular drains in place.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The dressing is often stained with blood in the immediate postoperative period. Because blood is an excellent culture medium for bacteria, the dressing is reinforced with sterile pads so that contamination and infection are avoided. A heavily stained or displaced dressing should be reported immediately. A drain is sometimes placed in the craniotomy incision to facilitate drainage.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After suboccipital surgical procedures, CSF may leak through the incision. This complication is dangerous because of the possibility of meningitis. After a suboccipital craniotomy, the patient is instructed to avoid coughing, sneezing, or nose blowing, which can cause CSF leakage by creating increased pressure on the operative site.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Any sudden discharge of fluid from a cranial incision is reported at once, because a large leak often requires surgical repair. Attention should be paid to the patient who complains of a salty taste or &#x201C;postnasal drip,&#x201D; because this can be caused by CSF trickling down the throat.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Aseptic technique is used when handling dressings, drainage systems, and IV and arterial lines. The patient is monitored carefully for signs and symptoms of infection, and cultures are obtained if infection is suspected. Appropriate antibiotic agents are given as prescribed. Other causes of infection in the patient undergoing intracranial surgery, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, are similar to those in other patients postoperatively.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Monitoring for Seizure Activity.</span> Seizures may occur as complications after any intracranial neurosurgical procedure. Preventing seizures is essential to avoid further cerebral edema. Administering the prescribed anticonvulsant medication before and after surgery may prevent the development of seizures in subsequent months and years. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;status epilepticus:&lt;/b&gt; episode in which the patient experiences multiple seizures with no recovery time in between">Status epilepticus</button></strong> (prolonged seizures without recovery of consciousness in the intervals between seizures) may occur after craniotomy and also may be related to the development of complications (hematoma, ischemia). The management of status epilepticus is described later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2015" title="2015"></span><span class="yltxt">Monitoring and Managing Other Complications.</span> Other complications may occur during the first 2 weeks or later and may compromise the patient&#x2019;s recovery. The most important of these are VTE (DVT, PE), pulmonary and urinary tract infection, and pressure injuries. Most of these complications may be avoided with frequent changes of position, adequate suctioning of secretions, thrombosis prophylaxis, early removal of indwelling urinary catheter, early ambulation, and skin care.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The recovery at home of a patient who has had neurosurgery depends on the extent of the surgical procedure and its success. The patient&#x2019;s strengths as well as limitations are assessed and explained to the family, along with the family&#x2019;s part in promoting recovery. Because administration of postoperative medication is a priority, the patient and family are educated to use a check-off system, pill boxes, and alarms to ensure that the medication is taken as prescribed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient and family are educated about what to expect after intracranial surgery (see <a href="#ct61-3">Chart 61-3</a>). Dietary restrictions usually are not required unless another health problem necessitates a special diet. Although showering or tub bathing is permitted, the scalp should be kept dry until all sutures have been removed, unless the primary provider has specific wound care instructions. A clean scarf or cap may be worn until a wig or hairpiece is purchased. If skull bone has been removed, a protective helmet may be prescribed. The patient may require rehabilitation, depending on the postoperative level of function. The patient may require physical therapy for residual weakness and mobility issues. An occupational therapist is consulted to assist with self-care issues. If the patient has aphasia, speech therapy may be necessary.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The patient is discharged from the hospital as soon as possible. Patients with severe motor deficits require extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation. Those with postoperative cognitive and speech impairments require psychological evaluation, speech therapy, and rehabilitation. The nurse collaborates with the primary provider and other health care professionals during hospitalization and home or transitional care to achieve as complete a rehabilitation as possible and to assist the patient in living with residual disability.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If tumor, injury, or disease makes the prognosis poor, care is directed toward making the patient as comfortable as possible. With return of the tumor or cerebral compression, the patient becomes less alert and aware. Other possible consequences include paralysis, blindness, and seizures. The home health nurse, hospice nurse, and social worker collaborate with the family to plan for additional services or placement of the patient in an extended care facility (see the Cerebral Metastases section in <a href="c65.xhtml">Chapter 65</a>).
