<h4 class="h4" id="s2792">Age-Related Macular Degeneration</h4>
<p class="nonindent">AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and visual impairment in the world (Bright Focus Foundation, 2020a). AMD is characterized by drusen beneath the retina (see <a href="#ff58-12">Fig. 58-12</a>). Most people older than 60 years have at least a few small drusen, which are clusters of debris or waste material. When drusen are located in the macular area, they can affect vision. Patients with AMD have a wide range of visual loss, but only a small portion experience total blindness. Central vision is generally the most affected, with most patients retaining peripheral vision (see <a href="#ff58-13">Fig. 58-13</a>). There are two types of AMD: the dry type and the wet type (Bright Focus Foundation, 2020a).</p>

<p class="indent">Between 85% and 90% of people with AMD have the dry (nonneovascular, nonexudative) type of the condition, in which the outer layers of the retina slowly break down. With this breakdown comes the appearance of drusen. When the drusen occur outside of the macular area, patients generally have no symptoms. When the drusen occur within the macula, however, there is a gradual blurring of vision that patients may notice when they try to read.</p>
<p class="indent">The second type of AMD, the wet (neovascular, exudative) type, may have an abrupt onset and is more damaging to the vision (Bright Focus Foundation, 2020a). Patients report that straight lines appear crooked and distorted or that letters in words appear broken. This effect results from proliferation of abnormal blood vessels growing under the retina, within the choroid layer of the eye, a condition known as choroidal neovascularization. The affected vessels can leak fluid and blood, elevating the retina. Some patients can be treated with laser therapy to stop leakage from these vessels.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Education for Patients About Preventing Eye Injuries</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient in the following measures to prevent eye injuries:</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>In and Around the House</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Make sure that all spray nozzles are directed away from yourself before pressing down on the handle.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Read instructions carefully before using cleaning fluids, detergents, ammonia, or harsh chemicals, and wash hands thoroughly after use.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use grease shields on frying pans to decrease spattering.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use opaque goggles to avoid burns from sunlamps.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wear special goggles to shield the eyes from fumes and splashes when using powerful chemicals.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>In the Workshop</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Protect the eyes from flying fragments, fumes, dust particles, sparks, and splashed chemicals by wearing safety glasses.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Read instructions thoroughly before using tools and chemicals, and follow precautions for their use.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Around Children</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Educate children about the correct way to handle potentially dangerous items, such as scissors and pencils.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Pay attention to age and maturity level of a child when selecting toys and games, and avoid projectile toys, such as darts and pellet guns.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Supervise children when they are playing with toys or games that can be dangerous.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>In the Garden</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid letting anyone stand at the side of or in front of a moving lawn mower.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2793">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is no known effective treatment or cure for dry advanced macular degeneration (Bright Focus Foundation, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">An important component of treatment of wet (neovascular, exudative) AMD targets development and progression of angiogenesis (abnormal blood vessel formation). Vasoproliferation in wet AMD is believed to be caused by an underlying angiogenic stimulus known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Bright Focus Foundation, 2020a). Examples of VEGF inhibitors given by intravitreal injection include ranibizumab and brolucizumab (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4174">Bright Focus Foundation, 2020a; Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2794">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Amsler grids are given to patients to use in their homes to monitor for a sudden onset or distortion of vision. These may provide the earliest sign that macular degeneration is getting worse. Patients should be encouraged to look at these grids, one eye at a time, several times each week with glasses on if needed for corrected near vision. If there is a change in the way the grid appears to the patient (e.g., if the lines or squares appear distorted or faded), the patient should notify the ophthalmologist immediately and should arrange to be seen promptly. There are digital versions of these grids as well that pick up abnormal changes quicker.</p>
