<h4 class="h4" id="s107">Personalized Genomic Treatments</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Information about genes and their variations helps researchers identify genetic differences that predispose certain people to more aggressive diseases and affect their responses to treatment. Genetics and genomics have revolutionized the field of oncology because genetic mutations are the basis for the development and progression of all cancers. In the medical era, individuals with cancer faced treatment based on the stage of the cancer, lymph node involvement, and spread to distant organs. Treatments of a particular type of cancer, stage for stage, were similar. Now, in the genomic era of personalized medicine, cancer is treated on the basis of genetic makeup. For example, women with early stage breast cancer (i.e., tumor diameter less than 2 cm, estrogen receptor&#x2013;positive tumors, no lymph node involvement) have often received chemotherapy. In the past, deciding which of these women would benefit the most from chemotherapy was unclear. Currently, a gene tumor profile of these women&#x2019;s tumors can be used to predict which women are more likely to have an aggressive cancer. Genetic testing helps clinicians to provide personalized care and the most effective treatment based on the genetic signature of the tumor treatment, called <em>targeted therapy,</em> which tries to match the treatment to the specific malfunctioning genes expressed in the tumor, or to selectively inhibit genetic factors that promote cancer growth (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Dodson, 2017</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib389">National Cancer Institute, 2019</a>). Progressive personalized genomic treatment has expanded into genome editing, known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), which shows promise for single gene disorders and cancer by repairing, replacing, or deleting genes that are altered or damaged (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Foss, Hochstrasser, &#x0026; Wilson, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s108">Pharmacogenomics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The difference between genetics and genomics, described earlier in this chapter, corresponds to the terms <em>pharmacogenetics</em> and <em>pharmacogenomics,</em> which combine pharmacology and genetics or genomics. Pharmacogenetics refers to the study of the effect of variations in a single gene on drug response and toxicity. The field of pharmacogenetics has evolved so that it has become a broader genomic-based approach that recognizes the interaction of multiple genes and the environment on drug response. Pharmacogenomics refers to the study of the combined effect of variations in many genes on drug response and toxicity and involves methods that rapidly identify which genetic variations influence a drug&#x2019;s effect. The aim of pharmacogenomics is to deliver safe, effective medication and dosages that are specifically tailored to a person&#x2019;s genetic makeup (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Dodson, 2017</a>). The clinical application of pharmacogenetics has provided a better understanding of drug pathways, leading to the development of new drugs that do not have toxic side effects and that have the potential to change current standards of treatment (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Conyers, Devaraja, &#x0026; Elliott, 2018</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Mannino, Andreozzi, &#x0026; Sesti, 2019</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Pickard, 2017</a>). Drug pathways target specific gene biomarkers to elicit a specific and therapeutic response (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">It has long been known that patients differ in their response to medications. The genetic and genomic variations in drug metabolism account largely for the differences in drug response and drug-related toxicities. Drug metabolism <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" title="131"></span>involves genetically controlled protein/enzyme activity for absorption, distribution, drug&#x2013;cell interaction, inactivation, and excretion&#x2014;metabolic processes that are known as pharmacokinetics. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes play a key role in the pharmacokinetic process of drug metabolism (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib366">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium [CPIC], 2019</a>). Once a drug reaches its target cell, other genes such as those regulating cell receptors and cell signaling control the drug&#x2019;s effect. This process is known as pharmacodynamics. Single genes may affect drug response. More commonly, drug response involves the interaction of multiple genes, the host, and the effects of other drugs. <a href="#ff6-12">Figure&#x00A0;6-12</a> is a schematic display of the genetic and genomic influences on drug metabolism and treatment effect.</p>
<p class="indent">SNPs, described earlier, are common genetic variations that occur most frequently throughout the human genome and often contribute to variations in enzymatic activity that affect drug metabolism. The CYPs, a family of enzymes, play a key role in the pharmacokinetic process of drug metabolism. Numerous variations (SNPs) of genes that control CYP activation and deactivation have been identified. Researchers have created a catalog of CYP variations because of their role in drug metabolism (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib366">CPIC, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Four classes of CYP metabolic activity levels have been identified based on a person&#x2019;s CYP genotype and the corresponding drug response: (1) poor metabolizers, (2) intermediate metabolizers, (3) extensive metabolizers, and (4) ultrarapid metabolizers. Poor metabolizers have a specific SNP variation in a CYP gene that causes little or no function, resulting in very little or no drug metabolism and higher blood levels of active drug because the drug cannot be absorbed or excreted. Conversely, ultrarapid metabolizers have SNP variations that cause increased enzyme activity, resulting in rapid absorption, distribution, and excretion of a drug. Ultrarapid metabolizers have lower drug blood levels, usually with inadequate therapeutic response or longer treatment time to achieve therapeutic results. Both poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers are predisposed to adverse drug reactions. Poor metabolizers may have adverse effects or toxicities from high blood levels of drugs and need a lower dose, whereas ultrarapid metabolizers have inadequate treatment response because of lower drug blood levels and may need a higher dose or more frequent dosing. Intermediate metabolizers have reduced enzyme activity levels and metabolize drugs at a slower than normal rate. Because intermediate metabolizers have some enzyme activity, they may have differences in treatment response. Extensive metabolizers have normal enzyme activity levels and normal drug metabolism. Differences in metabolism of other medications occur with other genetic variations.</p>

<p class="indent">Nurses have traditionally monitored and reported drug response and drug adverse effects. Pharmacogenomic (drug&#x2013;gene) testing is currently available for more than 16 drugs (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib386">Mayo Clinic, 2019</a>). This type of testing offers patients and health care providers more information about a specific drug and whether the medication is the best option for the patient based on genetic interactions that may influence the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of the drug, and the likelihood of an adverse effect from the medication. Nurses are in a position not only to provide education about a particular patient&#x2019;s genomic profile for drug metabolism, but also to explain the rationale for the recommended dosage and discuss associated symptoms related to potential adverse effects. Nurses will continue to incorporate information about gender differences, food interactions, and drug adherence into patient education (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>).</p>
