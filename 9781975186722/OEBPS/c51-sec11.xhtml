<h4 class="h4a" id="s2361"><strong>Fistulas of the Vagina</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fistula:&lt;/b&gt; anatomically abnormal tract that arises between two internal organs or between an internal organ and the body surface">fistula</button></strong> is an abnormal opening between two internal hollow organs or between an internal hollow organ and the exterior of the body. The name of the fistula indicates the two areas that are connected abnormally&#x2014;for example, a vesicovaginal fistula is an opening between the bladder and the vagina, and a rectovaginal fistula is an opening between the rectum and the vagina (see <a href="#ff51-2">Fig.&#x00A0;51-2</a>). Fistulas may be congenital in origin but are most common in developing countries due to obstructed labor complications. In developed countries, they occur most often as a result of injury during pelvic surgery, vaginal delivery, radiation therapy, complications from surgical insertion of vaginal mesh, or disease processes such as carcinoma (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">El-Azab, Abolella, &#x0026; Farouk, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2362">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms depend on the specific defect. For example, in a patient with a vesicovaginal fistula, urine escapes continuously into the vagina. With a rectovaginal fistula, there is fecal incontinence, and flatus is discharged through the vagina. The combination of fecal discharge with leukorrhea results in malodor that is difficult to control.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2363">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A history of the symptoms experienced by the patient is important to identify the structural alterations and to assess the impact of the symptoms on the patient&#x2019;s quality of life. Although there is no reported specificity for its use, methylene blue dye is commonly used to help delineate the course of the fistula (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">El-Azab et al., 2019</a>). In a vesicovaginal fistula, the dye is instilled into the bladder along with placement of vaginal packing known as the &#x201C;tampon test&#x201D;; stained vaginal packing can be indicative of a fistula (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">El-Azab et al., 2019</a>). Cystourethroscopy is useful in identifying fistula while cystoscopy or IV pyelography may then be used to determine the exact location.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2364">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal is to eliminate the fistula and to treat infection and excoriation. A fistula may heal without surgical intervention, but surgery is often required. If the primary provider determines that a fistula will heal without surgical intervention, care is planned to relieve discomfort, prevent infection, and improve the patient&#x2019;s self-concept and self-care abilities. Measures to promote healing include proper nutrition, cleansing douches and enemas, rest, and administration of prescribed intestinal antibiotic agents. A rectovaginal fistula heals faster when the patient eats a low-residue diet and when the affected tissue drains properly. Warm perineal irrigations promote healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, a fistula does not heal and cannot be surgically repaired. In this situation, care must be planned and implemented on an individual basis. Cleanliness, frequent sitz baths, and deodorizing douches are required, as are perineal pads and protective undergarments. Meticulous skin care is necessary to prevent excoriation. Applying bland creams or lightly dusting with cornstarch may be soothing. In addition, attending to the patient&#x2019;s social and psychological needs is an essential aspect of care.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is to have a fistula repaired surgically, preoperative treatment of any existing vaginitis is important to ensure success. Usually, the vaginal approach is used to repair vesicovaginal and urethrovaginal fistulas; the abdominal approach is used to repair fistulas that are large or complex. Fistulas that are difficult to repair or very large may require surgical repair with a urinary or fecal diversion. Tissue transfer techniques (skin or tissue grafting) may be used (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">El-Azab et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because fistulas usually are related to obstetric, surgical, or radiation trauma, occurrence in a patient without previous vaginal delivery or a history of surgery must be evaluated carefully. Crohn&#x2019;s disease and lymphogranuloma venereum are other possible causes.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the best surgical intervention, fistulas may recur. After surgery, medical follow-up continues for at least 2 years to monitor for a possible recurrence.</p>
