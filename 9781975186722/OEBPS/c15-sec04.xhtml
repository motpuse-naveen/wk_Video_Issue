<h4 class="h4" id="s500">The Surgical Experience</h4>
<p class="nonindent">During the surgical procedure, the patient will need sedation, anesthesia, or some combination of these. There are many low-risk anesthesia agents to choose from.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s501">Types of Anesthesia and Sedation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Research estimates anesthesia-related death rates in the United States to be less than 1 per 10,000 surgeries (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Barash et al., 2017</a>). For the patient, the anesthesia experience consists of having an IV line inserted, if it was not inserted earlier; receiving a sedating agent prior to induction with an anesthetic agent; losing consciousness; being intubated, if indicated; and then receiving a combination of anesthetic agents. Typically, the experience is a smooth one, and the patient has no recall of the events. The main types of anesthesia are general anesthesia (inhalation, IV), regional anesthesia (epidural, spinal, and local conduction blocks), moderate sedation (monitored anesthesia care [MAC]), and local anesthesia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">General Anesthesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anesthesia:&lt;/b&gt; a state of narcosis or severe central nervous system depression produced by pharmacologic agents">Anesthesia</button></strong> is a state of narcosis (severe central nervous system depression produced by pharmacologic agents), analgesia, relaxation, and reflex loss. Patients under general anesthesia are not arousable, not even to painful stimuli. They lose the ability to maintain ventilatory function and require assistance in maintaining a patent airway. Cardiovascular function may be impaired as well.</p>
<p class="indent">General anesthesia consists of four stages, each associated with specific clinical manifestations (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Understanding of these stages is necessary for nurses because of the emotional support that the patient might need as anesthesia progresses. These stages occur in reverse as the patient wakes up at the end of surgery, so the nurse must be aware of the need for appropriate patient support.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Stage I: beginning anesthesia.</em> Dizziness and a feeling of detachment may be experienced during induction. The patient may have a ringing, roaring, or buzzing in the ears and, although still conscious, may sense an inability to move the extremities easily. These sensations can result in agitation. During this stage, noises are exaggerated; even low voices or minor sounds seem loud and unreal. For these reasons, unnecessary noises and motions are avoided when anesthesia begins.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Stage II: excitement.</em> The excitement stage, characterized variously by struggling, shouting, talking, singing, laughing, or crying, is often avoided if IV anesthetic agents are given smoothly and quickly. The pupils dilate, but they constrict if exposed to light; the pulse rate is rapid; and respirations may be irregular. Because of the possibility of uncontrolled movements of the patient during this stage, the anesthesiologist or CRNA must always be assisted by someone ready to help restrain the patient or to apply cricoid pressure in the case of vomiting to prevent aspiration. Manipulation increases circulation to the operative site and thereby increases the potential for bleeding.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Stage III: surgical anesthesia.</em> Surgical anesthesia is reached by administration of anesthetic vapor or gas and supported by IV agents as necessary. The patient is unconscious and lies quietly on the table. The pupils are small but constrict when exposed to light. Respirations are regular, the pulse rate and volume are normal, and the skin is pink or slightly flushed. With proper administration of the anesthetic agent, this stage may be maintained for hours in one of several planes, ranging from light (1) to deep (4), depending on the depth of anesthesia needed.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Stage IV: medullary depression.</em> This stage is reached if too much anesthesia has been given. Respirations become shallow, the pulse is weak and thready, and the pupils become widely dilated and no longer constrict when exposed to light. Cyanosis develops and, without prompt intervention, death rapidly follows. If this stage develops, the anesthetic agent is discontinued immediately and respiratory and circulatory support is initiated to prevent death. Stimulants, although rarely used, may be given; narcotic antagonists can be used if the overdose is due to opioids. It is not a planned stage of surgical anesthesia.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">When opioid agents (narcotics) and neuromuscular blockers (relaxants) are given, several of the stages are absent. During smooth administration of an anesthetic agent, there is no sharp division between stages. The patient passes gradually from one stage to another, and it is through close observation of the signs exhibited by the patient that an anesthesiologist or CRNA controls the situation. The responses of the pupils, the blood pressure, and the respiratory and cardiac rates are among the most reliable guides to the patient&#x2019;s condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Anesthetic medications produce anesthesia because they are delivered to the brain at a high partial pressure that enables them to cross the blood&#x2013;brain barrier. Relatively large amounts of anesthetic medication must be given during induction and the early maintenance phases because the anesthetic agent is recirculated and deposited in body tissues. As these sites become saturated, smaller amounts of the anesthetic agent are required to maintain anesthesia because equilibrium or near-equilibrium has been achieved between brain, blood, and other tissues. When possible, the anesthesia induction (initiation) begins with IV anesthesia and is then maintained at the desired stage by inhalation methods, achieving a smooth transition and eliminating the obvious stages of anesthesia (see <a href="#tt15-1">Table&#x00A0;15-1</a>). All are given in combination with oxygen and usually nitrous oxide as well.</p>

<p class="indent">Any condition that diminishes peripheral blood flow, such as vasoconstriction or shock, may reduce the amount of anesthetic medication required. Conversely, when peripheral blood flow is unusually high, as in a muscularly active or apprehensive patient, induction is slower, and greater quantities of anesthetic agents are required because the brain receives a smaller quantity of anesthetic agent.</p>
<p class="h7">Inhalation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Inhaled anesthetic agents include volatile liquid agents and gases. Volatile liquid anesthetic agents produce anesthesia when their vapors are inhaled. Some commonly used inhalation agents are included in <a href="#tt15-1">Table&#x00A0;15-1</a>. All are given in combination with oxygen and usually nitrous oxide as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Gas anesthetic agents are given by inhalation and are always combined with oxygen. Nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, and desflurane are the most commonly used gas anesthetic agents. When inhaled, the anesthetic agents enter the blood through the pulmonary capillaries and act on cerebral centers to produce loss of consciousness and sensation. When anesthetic administration is discontinued, the vapor or gas is eliminated through the lungs.</p>
<p class="indent">The vapor from inhalation anesthetic agents can be given to the patient by several methods. The inhalation anesthetic agent may be given through an LMA&#x2014;a flexible tube with an inflatable silicone ring and cuff that can be inserted into the larynx (see <a href="#ff15-4">Fig.&#x00A0;15-4</a>A). The endotracheal technique for administering anesthetic medications consists of introducing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page426" title="426"></span>a soft rubber or plastic ET into the trachea, usually by means of a laryngoscope. The ET may be inserted through either the nose (see <a href="#ff15-4">Fig.&#x00A0;15-4</a>B) or mouth (see <a href="#ff15-4">Fig.&#x00A0;15-4</a>C). When in place, the tube seals off the lungs from the esophagus so that if the patient vomits, stomach contents do not enter the lungs.</p>

<p class="h7">Intravenous Administration</p>
<p class="nonindent">General anesthesia can also be produced by the IV administration of various anesthetic and analgesic agents, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, dissociative agents, and opioid agents. <a href="#tt15-2">Table&#x00A0;15-2</a> lists commonly used IV anesthetic and analgesic agents, including IV medications used as muscle relaxants in the intraoperative period. These medications may be given to induce or maintain anesthesia. Although they are often used in combination with inhalation anesthetic agents, they may be used alone. They may also be used to produce moderate sedation, as discussed later in this chapter.</p>

<p class="indent">An advantage of IV anesthesia is that the onset of anesthesia is pleasant; there is none of the buzzing, roaring, or dizziness known to follow administration of an inhalation anesthetic agent. The duration of action is brief, and the patient awakens with little nausea or vomiting.</p>
<p class="indent">The IV anesthetic agents are nonexplosive, require little equipment, and are easy to administer. The low incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) makes the method useful in eye surgery, because in this setting vomiting would increase intraocular pressure and endanger vision in the operated eye. IV anesthesia is useful for short procedures but is used less often for the longer procedures of abdominal surgery. It is not indicated for those who require intubation because of their susceptibility to respiratory obstruction. The combination of IV and inhaled anesthetic agents produces an effective and smooth experience for the patient, with a controlled emergence following surgery.</p>

<p class="indent">IV neuromuscular blockers (muscle relaxants) block the transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles. Muscle relaxants are used to relax muscles in abdominal and thoracic surgery, relax eye muscles in certain types of eye surgery, facilitate endotracheal intubation, treat laryngospasm, and assist in mechanical ventilation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Multimodal Anesthesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Multimodal analgesia</strong> regimens in surgical patients often use a combination of scheduled, nonopioid analgesic agents and regional anesthesia techniques (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Wolfe, 2018</a>). Multimodal analgesia aims to reduce opioid requirements and associated risks such as sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and potential of overuse of opioids. Multimodal anesthesia is a growing trend in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways, as it decreases the risks of general anesthesia and aids in opioid reduction strategies. Analysis of opioid-naive surgical patients and opioid-naive nonsurgical patients found that those undergoing surgery had an increased risk of chronic opioid use during the first year after surgery (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1288">Sun, Darnall, Baker, et al., 2016</a>). ERAS pathways are evidence based and facility specific; the patient follows these pathways from pre-, intra-, postoperative, and home phases of care. ERAS pathways are developed by multidisciplinary teams to optimize the recovery from surgery by reducing the patient&#x2019;s stress response. Instead of general anesthesia, regional/local anesthesia (LA) (discussed below) is administered. Nonopioid medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ketamine, and gabapentinoids are preferred pain control methods in ERAS pathways (American Association of Nurse Anesthetists [AANA], 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regional Anesthesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In regional anesthesia, an anesthetic agent is injected around nerves so that the region supplied by these nerves is anesthetized. The effect depends on the type of nerve involved. Motor fibers are the largest fibers and have the thickest myelin sheath. Sympathetic fibers are the smallest and have a minimal covering. Sensory fibers are intermediate. A local anesthetic agent blocks motor nerves least readily and sympathetic nerves most readily. An anesthetic agent is not considered metabolized until all three systems (motor, sensory, and autonomic) are no longer affected.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient receiving regional anesthesia is awake and aware of their surroundings unless medications are given to produce mild sedation or to relieve anxiety. The health care team must avoid careless conversation, unnecessary noise, and unpleasant odors; these may be noticed by the patient in the OR and may contribute to a negative response to the surgical experience. A quiet environment is therapeutic. The diagnosis must not be stated aloud if the patient is not to know it at this time.</p>
<p class="h7">Epidural Anesthesia</p>
<p class="nonindent">Epidural anesthesia is achieved by injecting a local anesthetic agent into the epidural space that surrounds the dura mater of the spinal cord (see <a href="#ff15-5">Fig.&#x00A0;15-5</a>). The given medication diffuses across the layers of the spinal cord to provide anesthesia and pain relief (AORN, 2019; ASPAN, 2019). In contrast, spinal anesthesia involves injection through the dura mater into the subarachnoid space surrounding the spinal cord. Epidural anesthesia blocks sensory, motor, and autonomic functions; it differs from spinal anesthesia by the site of the injection and the amount of anesthetic agent used. Epidural doses are much higher because the epidural anesthetic agent does not make direct contact with the spinal cord or nerve roots (AORN, 2019a; ASPAN, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">An advantage of epidural anesthesia is the absence of headache that can result from spinal anesthesia. A disadvantage is the greater technical challenge of introducing the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page429" title="429"></span>anesthetic agent into the epidural space rather than the subarachnoid space. If inadvertent puncture of the dura occurs during epidural anesthesia and the anesthetic agent travels toward the head, high spinal anesthesia can result; this can produce severe hypotension and respiratory depression and arrest. Treatment of these complications includes airway support, IV fluids, and the use of vasopressors.</p>

<p class="h7">Spinal Anesthesia</p>
<p class="nonindent">Spinal anesthesia is an extensive conduction nerve block that is produced when a local anesthetic agent is introduced into the subarachnoid space at the lumbar level, usually between L4 and L5 (see <a href="#ff15-5">Fig.&#x00A0;15-5</a>). It produces anesthesia of the lower extremities, perineum, and lower abdomen. For the lumbar puncture procedure, the patient usually lies on the side in a knee&#x2013;chest position. Sterile technique is used as a spinal puncture is made and the medication is injected through the needle. As soon as the injection has been made, the patient is positioned on their back. If a relatively high level of block is sought, the head and shoulders are lowered.</p>
<p class="indent">The spread of the anesthetic agent and the level of anesthesia depend on the amount of agent injected, the speed with which it is injected, the positioning of the patient after the injection, and the specific gravity of the agent. If the specific gravity is greater than that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the agent moves to the dependent position of the subarachnoid space. If the specific gravity is less than that of CSF, the anesthetic agent moves away from the dependent position. The anesthesiologist or CRNA controls the administration of the agent. <a href="#tt15-3">Table&#x00A0;15-3</a> presents select regional anesthesia agents.</p>
<p class="indent">A few minutes after induction of a spinal anesthetic agent, anesthesia and paralysis affect the toes and perineum and then gradually the legs and abdomen.</p>
<p class="indent">Headache may be an aftereffect of spinal anesthesia. Several factors are related to the incidence of headache: the size of the spinal needle used, the leakage of fluid from the subarachnoid space through the puncture site, and the patient&#x2019;s hydration status. Measures that increase cerebrospinal pressure are helpful in relieving headache. These include maintaining a quiet environment, keeping the patient lying flat, and keeping the patient well hydrated.</p>
<p class="indent">In continuous spinal anesthesia, the tip of a plastic catheter remains in the subarachnoid space during the surgical procedure so that more anesthetic medication may be injected as needed. This technique allows greater control of the dosage; however, there is greater potential for postanesthetic headache because of the large-gauge needle used.</p>
<p class="h7">Peripheral Nerve Blocks</p>
<p class="nonindent">Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are used in conjunction with general or MAC anesthesia, or as a stand-alone method. Instead of a single nerve being targeted, a bundle of nerves is located via ultrasound and injected with an anesthetic, opioid, or steroid. Traditionally, anesthesia would place the block in the OR setting. However, current research and best practices indicate that placing regional blocks in the preoperative department has greater efficacy. Patients emerge from anesthesia with less pain, decreasing the need for opioids. Research also suggests that patients spend less time in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and inpatients are discharged earlier (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1281">Gutierrez, Biehn, Eluna, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Examples of common local conduction blocks include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Brachial plexus block, which produces anesthesia of the arm</span></li>
<li><span>Paravertebral anesthesia, which produces anesthesia of the nerves supplying the chest, abdominal wall, and extremities</span></li>
<li><span>Transsacral (caudal) block, which produces anesthesia of the perineum and, occasionally, the lower abdomen</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Moderate Sedation</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;moderate sedation:&lt;/b&gt; previously referred to as conscious sedation, involves the use of sedation to depress the level of consciousness without altering the patient&#x2019;s ability to maintain a patent airway and to respond to physical stimuli and verbal commands">Moderate sedation</button></strong>, previously referred to as conscious sedation, is a form of anesthesia that involves the IV administration of sedatives or analgesic medications to reduce patient anxiety and control pain during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. It is commonly used for many short-term surgical procedures in hospitals and ambulatory care centers (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). The goal is to depress a patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness to a moderate level to enable surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures to be performed while ensuring the patient&#x2019;s comfort during and cooperation with the procedures. With moderate sedation, the patient is able to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page430" title="430"></span>maintain a patent airway, retain protective airway reflexes, and respond to verbal and physical stimuli.</p>
<p class="indent">Moderate sedation can be given by an anesthesiologist, CRNA, or other specially trained and credentialed physician or nurse. The practitioner who administers the sedation must be trained in resuscitative efforts as these patients are at risk for slipping into a deeper level of sedation (AORN, 2017). The continual assessment of the patient&#x2019;s vital signs, level of consciousness, and cardiac and respiratory function is an essential component of moderate sedation. Pulse oximetry, a continuous ECG monitor, and frequent measurement of vital signs are used to monitor the patient. Regulations for the use and administration of moderate sedation differ from state to state, and its administration is governed by standards issued by The Joint Commission and by institutional policies and nursing specialty organizations (AORN, 2017; ASPAN, 2018).</p>
<p class="h7">Monitored Anesthesia Care</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Monitored anesthesia care (MAC)</strong>, also referred to as monitored sedation, is moderate sedation given by an anesthesiologist or CRNA who must be prepared and qualified to convert to general anesthesia if necessary. The skills of an anesthesiologist or CRNA may be necessary to manage the effects of a level of deeper sedation to return the patient to the appropriate level of sedation (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Barash et al., 2017</a>). MAC may be used for healthy patients undergoing relatively minor surgical procedures and for some critically ill patients who may be unable to tolerate anesthesia without extensive invasive monitoring and pharmacologic support (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Local Anesthesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">LA is the injection of a solution containing the anesthetic agent into the tissues at the planned incision site. Often it is combined with a local regional block by injecting around the nerves immediately supplying the area. A monitoring nurse (in addition to a circulating nurse) must be present during these cases. The monitoring nurse is responsible for documenting the patient&#x2019;s condition, pain level, level of consciousness, and vital signs throughout the procedure (AORN, 2019a). Advantages of LA are as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>It is simple, economical, and nonexplosive.</span></li>
<li><span>Equipment needed is minimal.</span></li>
<li><span>Postoperative recovery is brief.</span></li>
<li><span>Undesirable effects of general anesthesia are avoided.</span></li>
<li><span>It is ideal for short and minor surgical procedures.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">LA is often given in combination with epinephrine. Epinephrine constricts blood vessels, which prevents rapid absorption of the anesthetic agent and thus prolongs its local action and prevents seizures. Select local anesthetic agents are listed in <a href="#tt15-3">Table&#x00A0;15-3</a>; some of the same agents used in regional anesthesia are used as local anesthetic agents.</p>
<p class="indent">The skin is prepared as for any surgical procedure, and a small-gauge needle is used to inject a modest amount of the anesthetic medication into the skin layers. This produces blanching or a wheal. Additional anesthetic medication is then injected into the skin until an area surrounding the proposed incision is anesthetized. A larger, longer needle then is used to infiltrate deeper tissues with the anesthetic agent. The action of the agent is almost immediate, so surgery may begin shortly after the injection is complete. The anesthetic may be mixed with a fast-acting analgesic of short duration to circumvent the burning felt when the longer-acting anesthetics are injected.</p>
<p class="h7">Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity</p>
<p class="nonindent">Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) is a potentially life-threatening event. LAST occurs when a bolus of LA is inadvertently injected into peripheral tissue or venous or arterial circulation during a PNB or spinal nerve block procedure and is rapidly absorbed into systemic circulation, resulting in cardiovascular or neurologic collapse (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1278">Ferguson, Coogle, Leppert, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms of LAST are:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Metallic taste</span></li>
<li><span>Oral numbness</span></li>
<li><span>Auditory changes</span></li>
<li><span>Slurred speech</span></li>
<li><span>Arrhythmias</span></li>
<li><span>Seizure</span></li>
<li><span>Respiratory arrest</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">LAST is a rare event that occurs in approximately 1 of every 1000 patients (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Wadlund, 2017</a>). Early detection and treatment may prevent symptom progression and can lead to a better outcome for the patient. Initial treatment of LAST should focus on airway management. Hypoxemia and acidosis intensify the effects of LAST. The nurse calls for help and maintains the patient&#x2019;s airway while administering 100% oxygen and confirming IV access. Additional resources include members of the anesthesia team and critical-care nurses in the event that CPR or airway interventions take place. An IV infusion of lipid emulsions (an emulsion of soybean oil, egg phospholipids, and glycerin) can reverse the effects of LAST on the heart and central nervous system (AORN, 2019a; Wadlund, 2017).</p>
