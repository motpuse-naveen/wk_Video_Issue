<p class="nonindent">Between 60 and 70 million people in the United States are diagnosed with some type of disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These diseases account for more than 48.3 million office visits to health care facilities and clinics and approximately 21.7 million hospital admissions annually. GI diseases cost the American public more than $141.8 billion and account for approximately 246,000 deaths each year (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2014b). The types of diseases and disorders that affect the lower GI tract are many and varied; examples include constipation, diarrhea, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p>
<p class="indent">In all age groups, a fast-paced lifestyle, high levels of stress, irregular eating habits, insufficient intake of fiber and water, and lack of daily exercise contribute to GI disorders. There is a growing understanding of the biopsychosocial implications of GI disease. The mind and emotions can have a profound impact on the GI system. Nurses can influence these GI disorders by identifying behavior patterns that put patients at risk, by educating the public about prevention and management, and by helping those affected to improve their condition and prevent complications.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec12"><strong>ABNORMALITIES OF FECAL ELIMINATION</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Changes in patterns of fecal elimination are symptoms of functional disorders or diseases of the GI tract. The most common changes seen are constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence.</p>
