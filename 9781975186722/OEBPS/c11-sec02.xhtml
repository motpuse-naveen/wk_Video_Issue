<h4 class="h4" id="s324">Stages of Shock</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Shock progresses along a continuum and can be identified as early or late, depending on the signs and symptoms and the overall severity of organ dysfunction. A convenient way to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page276" title="276"></span>understand the physiologic responses and subsequent clinical signs and symptoms of shock is to divide the continuum into separate stages: compensatory (stage 1), progressive (stage 2), and irreversible (stage 3). The earlier that interventions are initiated along this continuum, the greater the patient&#x2019;s chance of survival. Current research and evidence-based practice focuses on assessing patients at greatest risk for shock and implementing early and aggressive interventions to reverse tissue hypoxia (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib915">Zhang, Hong, Smischney, et al., 2017</a>). Current evidence suggests that the window of opportunity that increases the likelihood of patient survival occurs when aggressive therapy begins within 3 hours of identifying a shock state, especially septic shock (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib899">Rhodes, Evans, Alhazzani, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer, Deutschman, Seymour, et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s325">Compensatory Stage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the compensatory stage of shock, the BP remains within normal limits. Vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased contractility of the heart contribute to maintaining adequate cardiac output. This results from stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and subsequent release of catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine). Patients display the often-described &#x201C;fight-or-flight&#x201D; response. The body shunts blood from organs such as the skin, kidneys, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the brain, heart, and lungs to ensure adequate blood supply to these vital organs. As a result, the skin may be cool and pale, bowel sounds are hypoactive, and urine output decreases in response to the release of aldosterone and ADH.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s326">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Despite a normal BP, the patient shows numerous clinical signs indicating inadequate organ perfusion (<a href="#tt11-1">Table&#x00A0;11-1</a>). The result of inadequate perfusion is anaerobic metabolism and a buildup of lactic acid, producing metabolic acidosis. The respiratory rate increases in response to the need to increase oxygen to the cells and in compensation for metabolic acidosis. This rapid respiratory rate facilitates removal of excess CO<sub>2</sub> but raises the blood pH and often causes a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. The patient may experience a change in effect, feel anxious, or be confused. If treatment begins in this stage of shock, the prognosis for the patient is better than in later stages.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s327"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical treatment is directed toward identifying the cause of the shock, correcting the underlying disorder so that shock does not progress, and supporting those physiologic processes that thus far have responded successfully to the threat. Because compensation cannot be maintained indefinitely, measures such as fluid replacement, supplemental oxygen, and medication therapy must be initiated to maintain an adequate BP and reestablish and maintain adequate tissue perfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Makic &#x0026; Bridges, 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s328"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Early intervention along the continuum of shock is the key to improving the patient&#x2019;s prognosis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Makic &#x0026; Bridges, 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>). The nurse must systematically assess the patient at risk for shock, recognizing subtle clinical signs of the compensatory stage before the patient&#x2019;s BP drops. Early interventions include identifying the cause of shock, administering intravenous (IV) fluids and oxygen, and obtaining necessary laboratory tests to rule out and treat metabolic imbalances or infection. Special considerations related to recognizing early signs of shock in the older adult patient are discussed in <a href="#ct11-1">Chart&#x00A0;11-1</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Tissue Perfusion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In assessing tissue perfusion, the nurse observes for subtle changes in level of consciousness, vital signs (including pulse pressure), urinary output, skin (including assessment of capillary refill and signs of mottling), respiratory rate, and laboratory values (e.g., base deficit, lactic acid levels). In the compensatory stage of shock, serum sodium and blood glucose levels are elevated in response to the release of aldosterone and catecholamines. If infection is suspected, blood cultures should be obtained prior to administration of prescribed antibiotics; both of these interventions should be given priority in the care of the patient (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bridges, 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Levy, Evans, &#x0026; Rhodes, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should monitor the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic status and promptly report deviations to the primary provider, assist in identifying and treating the underlying disorder by continuous in-depth assessment of the patient, administer prescribed fluids and medications, and promote patient safety. Vital signs are key indicators of hemodynamic status, and BP is an indirect measure of tissue hypoxia. The nurse should report a systolic BP of 100 mm Hg or lower, or a drop in systolic BP of 40 mm Hg from baseline, or a MAP of 65 mm Hg or less (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Hallisey &#x0026; Greenwood, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>). If the patient is concurrently diagnosed with an infection or if an infection is suspected, the nurse should promptly notify the primary provider if the patient exhibits any two of the three following signs (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>) (see later discussion of Septic Shock):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Respiratory rate greater than or equal to 22 breaths/min</span></li>
<li><span>Altered mentation</span></li>
<li><span>Systolic BP less than or equal to 100 mm Hg</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Pulse pressure correlates well with stroke volume. Pulse pressure is calculated by subtracting the diastolic measurement from the systolic measurement; the difference is the pulse pressure. Normally, the pulse pressure is 30 to 40 mm Hg. Narrowing or decreased pulse pressure is an earlier indicator of shock than a drop in systolic BP (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Simmons &#x0026; Ventetuolo, 2017</a>). Decreased or narrowing pulse pressure, an early indication of decreased stroke volume, is illustrated in the following example:</p>

<div class="box7">
<p class="Box7pTitle"><strong>Recognizing Shock in Older Adults</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The physiologic changes associated with aging, coupled with pathologic and chronic disease states, place older adults at increased risk for developing a state of shock and possibly multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Older adults can recover from shock if it is detected and treated early with aggressive and supportive therapies. Nurses play an essential role in assessing and interpreting subtle changes in older adults&#x2019; responses to illness.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Medications such as beta-blocking agents (e.g., metoprolol) used to treat hypertension may mask tachycardia, a primary compensatory mechanism to increase cardiac output, during hypovolemic states.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The aging immune system may not mount a truly febrile response (temperature greater than 38.3&#x00B0;C [101&#x00B0;F]); however, a lack of a febrile response (temperature less than 37&#x00B0;C [98.6&#x00B0;F]) or an increasing trend in body temperature should be addressed. The patient may also report increased fatigue and malaise in the absence of a febrile response.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The heart does not function well in hypoxemic states, and the aging heart may respond to decreased myocardial oxygenation with arrhythmias that may be misinterpreted as a normal part of the aging process.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>There is a progressive decline in respiratory muscle strength, maximal ventilation, and response to hypoxia. Older adults have a decreased respiratory reserve and decompensate more quickly.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Changes in mentation may be inappropriately misinterpreted as dementia. Older adults with a sudden change in mentation should be aggressively assessed for acute delirium (hypo- and hyperdelirium states) and treated for the presence of infection and organ hypoperfusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Continuous central venous oximetry (Sc<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub>) monitoring may be used to evaluate mixed venous blood oxygen saturation and severity of tissue hypoperfusion states. A central catheter is introduced into the superior vena cava (SVC), and a sensor on the catheter measures the oxygen saturation of the blood in the SVC as blood returns to the heart and pulmonary system for reoxygenation. A normal Sc<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub> value is 70% (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Zhang et al., 2017</a>). Body tissues use approximately 25% of the oxygen delivered to them during normal metabolism. During stressful events, such as shock, more oxygen is consumed and the Sc<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub> saturation is lower, indicating that the tissues are consuming more oxygen.</p>
<p class="indent">Interventions focus on decreasing tissue oxygen requirements and increasing perfusion to deliver more oxygen to the tissues. For instance, sedating agents may be given to lower metabolic demands, or the patient&#x2019;s pain may be treated with opioid, nonopioid, or sedating agents (e.g., propofol, dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen) to decrease metabolic demands for oxygen. Supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation may be required to increase the delivery of oxygen in the blood. Administration of IV fluids and medications supports BP and cardiac output, and the transfusion of packed red blood cells enhances oxygen transport. Monitoring tissue oxygen consumption with Sc<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub> is an invasive measure to more accurately assess tissue oxygenation in the compensatory stage of shock before changes in vital signs detect altered tissue perfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Zhang et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In the patient who has an arterial line present, arterial pulse waveform analysis or pulse contour may be used to determine the patient&#x2019;s stroke volume and responsiveness to IV fluid replacement to meet tissue perfusion needs (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Simmons &#x0026; Ventetuolo, 2017</a>). More commonly, passive leg raising (PLR) is used to determine which patients will or will not respond to IV fluid bolus challenges. PLR involves raising the patient&#x2019;s legs to a 30- to 45-degree angle to increase venous return and thus cardiac output (<a href="#ff11-3">Fig.&#x00A0;11-3</a>). If the blood pressure improves with PLR, the patient will respond to additional fluids. If the blood pressure does not improve, giving more IV fluids will not improve the patient&#x2019;s condition and can precipitate fluid overload (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib882">Laher, Watermeyer, Buchanan, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib896">Pickett, Bridges, Kritek, et al., 2018</a>). If the patient is mechanically ventilated, functional hemodynamic monitoring will be used to assess fluid volume needs and the patient&#x2019;s response to IV fluid administration (i.e., preload, cardiac output, and blood pressure). An improvement in preload, cardiac output, and blood pressure indicates a favorable response. Functional hemodynamic monitoring has replaced static measures obtained from central venous pressure (CVP) or pulmonary artery (PA) monitoring. Functional hemodynamic monitoring assesses real-time dynamic changes between the patient&#x2019;s breathing patterns and circulating blood volume. Assessing functional hemodynamic parameters requires the patient to be mechanically ventilated and have an invasive arterial catheter placed and connected to monitoring devices that measure fluid volume (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bridges, 2013</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Hallisey &#x0026; Greenwood, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Simmons &#x0026; Ventetuolo, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Although treatments are prescribed and initiated by the primary provider, the nurse usually implements them, operates and troubleshoots equipment used in treatment, monitors the patient&#x2019;s status during treatment, and evaluates the immediate effects of treatment. In addition, the nurse assesses the response of the family to the crisis and its treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Anxiety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients and their families often become anxious and apprehensive when they face a major threat to health and well-being and are the focus of attention of many health care providers. Providing brief explanations about the diagnostic and treatment procedures, supporting the patient during these procedures, and providing information about their outcomes are usually effective in reducing stress and anxiety and thus promoting the patient&#x2019;s physical and mental well-being. Speaking in a calm, reassuring voice and using gentle touch also help ease the patient&#x2019;s concerns. These actions may provide comfort for patients who are critically ill and frightened (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib897">Reaza-Alarc&#x00F3;n &#x0026; Rodr&#x00ED;guez-Mart&#x00ED;n, 2019</a>). Evidence suggests that family members have certain needs during a health-related crisis, which include that health care professionals provide honest, consistent, and thorough communication; are present with the patient to facilitate physical and emotional support; demonstrate caring behaviors, see the patient frequently, and know the daily, short-term, and long-term plan of care for the patient (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib897">Reaza-Alarc&#x00F3;n &#x0026; Rodr&#x00ED;guez-Mart&#x00ED;n, 2019</a>; Wong, Redley, Digby, et al., 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should advocate for family members to be present during procedures and routine patient care activities. The presence of family provides an important connection and support for the patient during a time of crisis. Clinical practice guidelines suggest that sharing decision making with the patient and the family enhances communication with the health care team, reduces patient anxiety, and improves overall satisfaction with care (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib861">Davidson, Aslakson, Long, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Clarifying Advance Directives</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because shock can progress rapidly and its course may be unpredictable, it is important for the nurse to ask patients on admission if they have advance directives, including durable power of attorney for health care or living wills, or if they have had conversations with anyone about their health care wishes. When appropriate, the patient and family (with patient permission) should be approached regarding preferences for resuscitation and Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>). The POLST helps ensure that the patient&#x2019;s wishes are honored if their condition deteriorates rapidly and they lose the ability to speak for themselves (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Turner &#x0026; Hylton, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Safety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse must be vigilant for potential threats to the patient&#x2019;s safety, because a high anxiety level and changes in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page279" title="279"></span>mental status may impair judgment. Patients who were previously cooperative and followed instructions may now disrupt IV lines and catheters, increasing the risk for potential complications. Close monitoring, frequent reorientation, hourly rounding, and implementing interventions to prevent falls (e.g., bed alarms) are essential.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s329">Progressive Stage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the second stage of shock, the mechanisms that regulate BP can no longer compensate, and the MAP falls below normal limits. Patients are clinically hypotensive; this is defined as a systolic BP of 100 mm Hg or lower, or a decrease in systolic BP of 40 mm Hg from baseline. The patient shows signs of declining mental status (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib905">Singer et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s330">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although all organ systems suffer from hypoperfusion at this stage, several events perpetuate the shock syndrome. First, the overworked heart becomes dysfunctional, the body&#x2019;s inability to meet increased oxygen requirements produces ischemia, and biochemical mediators cause myocardial depression (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Massaro, 2018</a>). This leads to failure of the heart, even if the underlying cause of the shock is not of cardiac origin. Second, the autoregulatory function of the microcirculation fails in response to the numerous biochemical mediators released by the cells, resulting in increased capillary permeability, with areas of arteriolar and venous constriction further compromising cellular perfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Massaro, 2018</a>). At this stage, the prognosis worsens. The relaxation of precapillary sphincters causes fluid to leak from the capillaries, creating interstitial edema and decreased return to the heart. In addition, the inflammatory response is activated, and proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators are released, which activate the coagulation system in an effort to reestablish homeostasis (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>). The body mobilizes energy stores and increases oxygen consumption to meet the increased metabolic needs of the underperfused tissues and cells. Anaerobic metabolism ensues, resulting in a buildup of lactic acid and disruption of normal cell function.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if the underlying cause of the shock is reversed, the sequence of compensatory responses to the decrease in tissue perfusion perpetuates the shock state, and a vicious cycle ensues. The cellular reactions that occur during the progressive stage of shock are an active area of clinical research. It is believed that the body&#x2019;s response to shock or lack of response in this stage of shock may be the primary factor determining the patient&#x2019;s survival. Early recognition of shock signs and symptoms is essential to improving morbidity and mortality.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s331">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chances of survival depend on the patient&#x2019;s general health before the shock state as well as the amount of time it takes to restore tissue perfusion. As shock progresses, organ systems decompensate (see <a href="#tt11-1">Table&#x00A0;11-1</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Respiratory Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The lungs, which become compromised early in shock, are affected at this stage. Subsequent decompensation of the lungs increases the likelihood that mechanical ventilation will be needed. Respirations are rapid and shallow. Crackles are heard over the lung fields. Decreased pulmonary blood flow causes arterial oxygen levels to decrease and CO<sub>2</sub> levels to increase. Hypoxemia and biochemical mediators cause an intense inflammatory response and pulmonary vasoconstriction, perpetuating pulmonary capillary hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. The hypoperfused alveoli stop producing surfactant and subsequently collapse. Pulmonary capillaries begin to leak, causing pulmonary edema, diffusion abnormalities (shunting), and additional alveolar collapse. This condition is called <em>acute lung injury</em> (ALI); as ALI continues, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are common consequences, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Mitchell &#x0026; Seckel, 2018</a>). Further explanation of ALI and ARDS, as well as their nursing management, can be found in <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiovascular Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A lack of adequate blood supply leads to arrhythmias and ischemia. The heart rate is rapid, sometimes exceeding 150 bpm. The patient may complain of chest pain and even suffer a myocardial infarction (MI). Levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., cardiac troponin I [cTn-I]) increase. In addition, myocardial depression and ventricular dilation may further impair the heart&#x2019;s ability to pump enough blood to the tissues to meet increasing oxygen requirements.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neurologic Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As blood flow to the brain becomes impaired, mental status deteriorates. Changes in mental status occur with decreased cerebral perfusion and hypoxia. Initially, the patient may exhibit subtle changes in behavior, become agitated, confused, or demonstrate signs of delirium. (See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for more information about delirium.) Subsequently, lethargy increases, and the patient begins to lose consciousness.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Renal Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the MAP falls below 65 mm Hg (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Hallisey &#x0026; Greenwood, 2019</a>), the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys cannot be maintained, and significant changes in renal function occur. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels, fluid and electrolyte shifts, acid&#x2013;base imbalances, and a loss of the renal&#x2013;hormonal regulation of BP. Urinary output usually decreases to less than 0.5 mL/kg/h (or less than 30 mL/h) but may vary depending on the phase of AKI. (See <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a> for further information about AKI.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hepatic Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Decreased blood flow to the liver impairs the ability of liver cells to perform metabolic and phagocytic functions. Consequently, the patient is less able to metabolize medications and metabolic waste products, such as ammonia and lactic acid. Metabolic activities of the liver, including gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, are impaired. The patient becomes more susceptible to infection as the liver fails to filter bacteria from the blood. Liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase) and bilirubin levels are elevated, and the patient develops jaundice.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">GI ischemia can cause stress ulcers in the stomach, putting the patient at risk for GI bleeding. In the small intestine, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page280" title="280"></span>mucosa can become necrotic and slough off, causing bloody diarrhea. Beyond the local effects of impaired perfusion, GI ischemia leads to bacterial translocation and organ dysfunction, in which bacterial toxins enter the bloodstream through the lymphatic system. In addition to causing infection, bacterial toxins can cause cardiac depression, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and an intense inflammatory response with activation of additional biochemical mediators. The net result is interference with healthy cellular functioning and the ability to metabolize nutrients (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hematologic Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The combination of hypotension, sluggish blood flow, metabolic acidosis, coagulation system imbalance, and generalized hypoxemia can interfere with normal hemostatic mechanisms. In shock states, the inflammatory cytokines activate the clotting cascade, causing deposition of microthrombi in multiple areas of the body and consumption of clotting factors. The alterations of the hematologic system, including imbalance of the clotting cascade, are linked to the overactivation of the inflammatory response (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Massaro, 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Seymour &#x0026; Angus, 2018</a>). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may occur either as a cause or as a complication of shock. In this condition, widespread clotting and bleeding occur simultaneously. Ecchymoses (bruises) and petechiae (bleeding) may appear in the skin. Coagulation times (e.g., prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) are prolonged. Clotting factors and platelets are consumed and require replacement therapy to achieve hemostasis. (Further discussion of DIC appears in <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s332"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Specific medical management in the progressive stage of shock depends on the type of shock, its underlying cause, and the degree of decompensation in the organ systems. Medical management specific to each type of shock is discussed later in this chapter. Although medical management in the progressive stage differs by type of shock, some medical interventions are common to all types. These include the use of appropriate IV fluids and medications to restore tissue perfusion by the following methods:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Supporting the respiratory system</span></li>
<li><span>Optimizing intravascular volume</span></li>
<li><span>Supporting the pumping action of the heart</span></li>
<li><span>Improving the competence of the vascular system</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Other aspects of management may include early enteral nutritional support, targeted hyperglycemic control with IV insulin and use of antacids, histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) blockers, or antipeptic medications to reduce the risk of GI ulceration and bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Tight glycemic control (i.e., maintaining serum glucose close to the normal parameters of 80 to 100 mg/dL) is not recommended in patients who are critically ill because this therapy has been found to result in adverse patient outcomes (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib867">Griesdale, DeSouza, VanDam, et al., 2009</a>). Current evidence suggests that maintaining serum glucose less than 180 mg/dL with insulin therapy and close monitoring is indicated in the management of the patient who is critically ill (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib849">American Diabetes Association, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Rhodes et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s333"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of patients in the progressive stage of shock requires expertise in assessing and understanding shock and the significance of changes in assessment data. Early interventions are essential to the survival of patients; therefore, suspecting that a patient may be in shock and reporting subtle changes in assessment are imperative. Patients in the progressive stage of shock are cared for in the intensive care setting to facilitate close monitoring (hemodynamic monitoring, electrocardiographic [ECG] monitoring, arterial blood gases, serum electrolyte levels, physical and mental status changes); rapid and frequent administration of various prescribed medications and fluids; and possibly interventions with supportive technologies, such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis (e.g., continuous renal replacement therapy), and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).</p>
<p class="indent">Working closely with other members of the health care team, the nurse carefully documents treatments, medications, and fluids that are given; the time, dosage or volume, and patient responses are recorded. In addition, the nurse coordinates care, including the scheduling of diagnostic procedures that may occur at the bedside, and communication among health care personnel, family members, and the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse monitors the patient for early signs of complications to help reduce potential risks to the patient. Monitoring includes evaluating blood levels of medications, observing invasive vascular lines and catheters for signs of infection, and checking neurovascular status if arterial lines are inserted, especially in the lower extremities. Simultaneously, the nurse promotes the patient&#x2019;s safety and comfort by ensuring that all procedures, including invasive procedures and arterial and venous punctures, are carried out using correct aseptic techniques and that venous and arterial puncture and infusion sites are maintained with the goal of preventing infection. Nursing interventions that reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) must also be implemented. These include frequent oral care with a toothbrush, aseptic suction technique, turning, elevating the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent aspiration, and implementing daily interruption of sedation as prescribed to evaluate patient readiness for extubation (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib892">Mitchell, Russo, Cheng, et al., 2019</a>). See <a href="c19-sec04.xhtml#ct19-6">Chart&#x00A0;19-6</a> for an overview of the evidence-based (&#x201C;bundled&#x201D;) interventions aimed at preventing VAP. Positioning and repositioning of the patient to promote comfort and maintain skin integrity are essential.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must also be vigilant in assessing for acute delirium, characterized by an acute change in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Delirium is potentially preventable (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib863">Devlin, Skrobik, Gelians, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Makic, 2018</a>). Patients who are critically ill and have delirium have longer mechanical ventilation support <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page281" title="281"></span>needs, experience higher functional decline, and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than those without delirium. Furthermore, they are at a higher risk of developing postintensive care syndrome (PICS), which manifests as new or worsening impairments in the patient&#x2019;s physical, cognitive, or mental status after a critical illness has resolved and that persists beyond the acute hospitalization (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Devlin et al., 2018</a>). Delirium should be assessed at a minimum each shift using a standardized delirium assessment tool, such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)-ICU (Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship (CIBS) Center, 2020). The CAM-ICU is a modified version of the CAM, specifically designed for use in patients who are critically ill (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="c08-sec03.xhtml#ct8-7">Chart&#x00A0;8-7</a> for discussion of the CAM). Nursing interventions that can prevent delirium include engaging the patient in frequent reorientation activities (e.g., to date, time, place), assessing and treating pain, promoting sleep, providing early mobilization activities, and limiting sedation, especially sedation with benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Devlin et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Makic, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Rest and Comfort</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Efforts are made to minimize the cardiac workload by reducing the patient&#x2019;s physical activity and treating pain and anxiety. Because promoting patient rest and comfort is a priority, the nurse performs essential nursing activities in blocks of time, allowing the patient to have periods of uninterrupted sleep, which may prevent acute delirium, as noted previously (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Devlin et al., 2018</a>). To conserve the patient&#x2019;s energy, the nurse should protect the patient from temperature extremes (e.g., excessive warmth or cold, shivering), which can increase the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption and thus the cardiac workload.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Supporting Family Members</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because patients in shock receive intense attention by the health care team, families may be overwhelmed and frightened. Family members may be reluctant to ask questions or seek information for fear that they will be in the way or will interfere with the attention given to the patient. The nurse should make sure that the family is comfortably situated and kept informed about the patient&#x2019;s status. Often, families need encouragement from the health care team to get some rest; family members are more likely to take this advice if they feel that the patient is being well cared for and that they will be notified of any significant changes in the patient&#x2019;s status. A visit from the hospital chaplain may be comforting and provides some attention to the family while the nurse concentrates on the patient. Ensuring patient- and family-centered care is central to the delivery of high-quality care. This helps meet the emotional well-being as well as the physiologic needs of the patient and the family (Wong et al., 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s334">Irreversible Stage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The irreversible (or refractory) stage of shock represents the point along the shock continuum at which organ damage is so severe that the patient does not respond to treatment and cannot survive. Despite treatment, BP remains low. Renal and liver dysfunction, compounded by the release of biochemical mediators, creates an acute metabolic acidosis. Anaerobic metabolism contributes to a worsening lactic acidosis. Reserves of ATP are almost totally depleted, and mechanisms for storing new supplies of energy have been destroyed. Respiratory system dysfunction prevents adequate oxygenation and ventilation despite mechanical ventilatory support, and the cardiovascular system is ineffective in maintaining an adequate MAP for tissue perfusion. Multiple organ dysfunction progressing to complete organ failure has occurred, and death is imminent. Multiple organ dysfunction can occur as a progression along the shock continuum or as a syndrome unto itself and is described in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s335"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management during the irreversible stage of shock is similar to interventions and treatments used in the progressive stage. Although the patient may have progressed to the irreversible stage, the judgment that the shock is irreversible can only be made after the patient has failed to respond to treatment. Strategies that may be experimental (e.g., investigational medications, such as immunomodulation therapy) may be tried to reduce or reverse the severity of shock.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s336"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As in the progressive stage of shock, the nurse focuses on carrying out prescribed treatments, monitoring the patient, preventing complications, protecting the patient from injury, and providing comfort. Offering brief explanations to the patient about what is happening is essential even if there is no certainty that the patient hears or understands what is being said. Simple comfort measures, including reassuring touches, should continue to be provided despite the patient&#x2019;s nonresponsiveness to verbal stimuli (Wong et al., 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">As it becomes obvious that the patient is unlikely to survive, the family needs to be informed about the prognosis and likely outcome. Opportunities should be provided throughout the patient&#x2019;s care for the family to see, touch, and talk to the patient. Close friends or spiritual or religious advisors may be of comfort to the family members in dealing with the inevitable death of their loved one.</p>
<p class="indent">During this stage of shock, the family may misinterpret the actions of the health care team. They have been told that nothing has been effective in reversing the shock and that the patient&#x2019;s survival is very unlikely, yet they find primary providers and nurses continuing to work feverishly on the patient. Distraught, grieving families may interpret this as a chance for recovery when none exists, and family members may become angry when the patient dies. Conferences with all members of the health care team and the family promote better understanding by the family of the patient&#x2019;s prognosis and the purpose for management interventions. Engaging palliative care specialists can be beneficial in developing a plan of care that maximizes comfort and effective symptom management as well as assisting the family with difficult decisions (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Ivany &#x0026; Aitken, 2019</a>). During these conferences, it is essential to explain that the equipment and treatments being provided are intended for patient comfort and do not suggest that the patient will recover. Family members should be encouraged to express their views of life-support measures. In some cases, ethics committees may be consulted to assist families and health care teams make complex end-of-life decisions (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Ivany &#x0026; Aitken, 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Turner &#x0026; Hylton, 2019</a>).</p>
