<h4 class="h4" id="s2919">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in patients with altered neurologic function. The nurse should educate the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. Women who are premenopausal are advised to practice effective contraception before and for several days after any diagnostic procedure using contrast, and the woman who is breast-feeding is instructed to stop for the time period recommended by the nuclear medicine department (<a href="#bib4301">Pagana &#x0026; Pagana, 2018</a>). The nurse should note trends in results, because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2920">Computed Tomography Scanning</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Computed tomography (CT) scanning uses a narrow x-ray beam to scan body parts in successive layers. The images provide cross-sectional views of the brain, distinguishing differences in tissue densities of the skull, cortex, subcortical structures, and ventricles. An intravenous (IV) contrast agent may be used to highlight differences further. The brightness of each slice of the brain in the final image is proportional to the degree to which it absorbs x-rays. The image is displayed on an oscilloscope or television monitor and is photographed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1986" title="1986"></span>and stored digitally (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). CT scanning is usually performed first without contrast material and then with IV contrast, if needed. The patient lies on an adjustable table with the head in a headrest while the scanning system rotates around the head and produces cross-sectional images. The patient must lie with the head held perfectly still without talking or moving the face, because head motion distorts the image. CT scanning is quick and painless and uses a small amount of radiation to produce images; it has a high degree of sensitivity for detecting lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">Brain lesions have a different tissue density from the surrounding normal brain tissue. Abnormalities detected on brain CT include tumor or other masses, infarction, hemorrhage, displacement of the ventricles, and cortical atrophy (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). CT angiography allows visualization of blood vessels; in some situations, this eliminates the need for formal angiography. Whole-body CT scanners allow cross-sections of the spinal cord to be visualized. The injection of a water-soluble iodinated contrast agent into the subarachnoid space through lumbar puncture improves the visualization of the spinal and intracranial contents on these images. The CT scan, along with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has largely replaced myelography as a diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of herniated lumbar discs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Essential nursing interventions include preparation for the procedure and patient monitoring. Preparation includes educating the patient about the need to lie quietly throughout the procedure. A review of relaxation techniques may be helpful for patients with claustrophobia. Sedation can be used if agitation, restlessness, or confusion interferes with a successful study. Ongoing patient monitoring during sedation is necessary. If a contrast agent is used, the patient must be assessed before the CT scan for an iodine/shellfish allergy, because the contrast agent used may be iodine based. Kidney function must also be evaluated because the contrast material is cleared through the kidneys. A suitable IV line for contrast injection and a period of fasting (usually 4 hours) are required prior to the study. Patients who receive an IV contrast agent are monitored during and after the procedure for allergic reactions and changes in kidney function (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Fluid intake is also encouraged after IV contrast to facilitate contrast clearance through the kidney.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2921">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">MRI uses a powerful magnetic field to obtain images of different areas of the body. The magnetic field causes the hydrogen nuclei (protons) within the body to align like small magnets in a magnetic field. In combination with radiofrequency pulses, the protons emit signals, which are converted to images. An MRI scan can be performed with or without a contrast agent and can identify a cerebral abnormality earlier and more clearly than other diagnostic tests (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). It can provide information about the chemical changes within cells, allowing the clinician to monitor a tumor&#x2019;s response to treatment. It is particularly useful in the diagnosis of brain tumor, stroke, and multiple sclerosis and does not involve ionizing radiation. An MRI scan may take an hour or longer to complete, so its use in emergency situations is limited.</p>
<p class="indent">Several MRI applications allow imaging of brain blood flow and metabolism via special imaging techniques added to the MRI. Such techniques include diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) allows separate visualization of the cerebral vasculature without the administration of an arterial contrast agent. Both MRI and CT images are used as tools to plan and direct surgical intervention.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient preparation includes providing education and obtaining an adequate history. Ferromagnetic substances in the body may become dislodged by the magnet, so history of working with metal fragments must be reviewed. Patients with any type of cardiac implantable electronic device need to be screened to see if it is safe for the patient to undergo any type of MRI (<a href="#bib4290">Indik, Gimbel, Abe, et al., 2017</a>). The patient is assessed for implants containing metal (e.g., aneurysm clips, orthopedic hardware, artificial heart valves, intrauterine devices). These objects could malfunction, be dislodged, or heat up as they absorb energy. Cochlear implants will be inactivated by MRI; therefore, other imaging procedures are considered. A complete list of metal compatibility may be found on MRI manufacturer Web sites.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the patient enters the room where the MRI is to be performed, all metal objects and credit cards (the magnetic field can erase them) must be removed. This includes medication patches that have a metal backing and metallic lead wires; these can cause burns if not removed (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). No metal objects may be brought into the room where the MRI is located; this includes oxygen tanks, IV poles, ventilators, or even stethoscopes. The magnetic field generated by the unit is so strong that any metal-containing items will be strongly attracted and literally can be pulled away with such force that they fly like projectiles toward the magnet. There is a risk of severe injury and death. Further, damage to expensive equipment may occur.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>For patient safety, the nurse prevents any patient care equipment containing metal or metal parts (e.g., portable oxygen tanks, wheelchairs) from entering the room where the MRI is located. The nurse also assesses for and removes any medication patches with foil backing (such as nicotine patches) that may cause a burn while an MRI scan is being performed.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">For the MRI, the patient lies with the head in a frame on a flat platform that is moved into a tube housing the magnet (see <a href="#ff60-14">Fig. 60-14</a>). The tube is narrow; people with a wide girth may not fit into the scanner. Patients who are unable to lie flat will not be able to tolerate an MRI. The scanning process is painless, but the patient hears loud thumping of the magnetic coils as the magnetic field is being pulsed. Patients may experience claustrophobia while inside the narrow tube; sedation may be prescribed in these circumstances. &#x201C;Open&#x201D; MRI machines are less claustrophobic than the other devices and are available in many locations. However, the images <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1987" title="1987"></span>produced on these machines are sometimes not so detailed, and traditional devices are preferred for accurate diagnosis. The patient may be educated about the use of relaxation techniques while in the scanner. The patient is informed that it will be possible to talk to the staff during the scan through a microphone inside the scanner (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2922">Positron Emission Tomography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">PET is a computer-based nuclear imaging technique that produces images of actual organ functioning. The patient either inhales a radioactive gas or is injected with a radioactive substance that emits positively charged particles. When these positrons combine with negatively charged electrons (normally found in the body&#x2019;s cells), the resultant gamma rays can be detected by a scanning device that produces a series of two-dimensional views at various levels of the brain. This information is integrated by a computer and gives a composite picture of the brain at work.</p>
<p class="indent">PET permits the measurement of blood flow, tissue composition, and brain metabolism and thus indirectly evaluates brain function. The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs, consuming 80% of the glucose the body uses (<a href="#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). PET measures this activity in specific areas of the brain and can detect changes in glucose use.</p>
<p class="indent">PET is useful in showing metabolic changes in the brain (Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease), locating lesions (brain tumor, epileptogenic lesions), identifying blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with strokes, distinguishing tumor from areas of necrosis, and revealing biochemical abnormalities associated with mental illness. The isotopes used have a very short half-life and are expensive to produce, requiring specialized equipment for production. Improvement in the scanning procedure and production of isotopes, as well as the advent of reimbursement by third-party payers, has increased the clinical applications of PET studies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Key nursing interventions include patient preparation, which involves explaining the test and educating the patient about inhalation techniques and the sensations (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, headache) that may occur. The IV injection of the radioactive substance produces similar side effects. Relaxation exercises may reduce anxiety during the test.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2923">Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SPECT is a three-dimensional imaging technique that uses radionuclides and instruments to detect single photons. It is a perfusion study that captures a moment of cerebral blood flow at the time of injection of a radionuclide. Gamma photons are emitted from a radiopharmaceutical agent given to the patient and are detected by a rotating gamma camera or cameras; the image is sent to a minicomputer. This approach allows areas behind overlying structures or background to be viewed, greatly increasing the contrast between normal and abnormal tissue. It is relatively inexpensive, and the duration is similar to that of a CT scan.</p>
<p class="indent">SPECT is useful in detecting the extent and location of abnormally perfused areas of the brain, thus allowing detection, localization, and sizing of stroke (before it is visible by CT scan); localization of seizure foci in epilepsy; detection of tumor progression (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>); and evaluation of perfusion before and after neurosurgical procedures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nursing interventions for SPECT primarily include patient preparation and patient monitoring. Providing education about what to expect before the test can allay anxiety and ensure patient cooperation during the test. Pregnancy and breast-feeding are contraindications to SPECT.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse may need to accompany and monitor the patient during transport to the nuclear medicine department for the scan. Patients are monitored during and after the procedure for allergic reactions to the radiopharmaceutical agent.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2924">Cerebral Angiography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cerebral angiography is an x-ray study of the cerebral circulation with a contrast agent injected into a selected artery. A valuable tool in investigating vascular disease or anomalies, it is used to determine vessel patency, identify presence of collateral circulation, and provide detail on vascular anomalies that can be used in planning interventions. With the advent of additional imaging techniques, formal cerebral angiography is less frequently performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Cerebral angiograms are performed by threading a catheter through the femoral artery in the groin or the radial artery of the wrist and up to the desired vessel. Alternatively, direct puncture of the carotid artery may be performed. X-ray images are obtained as the contrast agent flows through the vessels; the carotid and vertebral arterial systems are visualized, as well as venous drainage. Arterial access may also be used for interventional procedures, such as placing coils in an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to the angiography, the patient&#x2019;s blood urea nitrogen and creatinine should be checked to ensure the kidneys will be able to excrete the contrast agent. The patient should be well hydrated, and clear liquids are usually permitted up to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1988" title="1988"></span>the time of the test. The patient is instructed to void immediately before the test, and locations of the appropriate peripheral pulses are marked with a felt-tip pen. The patient is instructed to remain immobile during the angiogram process and is told to expect a brief feeling of warmth in the face, behind the eyes, or in the jaw, teeth, tongue, and lips, and a metallic taste when the contrast agent is injected.</p>
<p class="indent">When the femoral artery is selected for access, the hair in the groin is clipped and prepared and a local anesthetic agent is given to minimize pain at the insertion site and to reduce arterial spasm. A catheter is introduced into the femoral artery, flushed with heparinized saline, and filled with contrast agent. When the radial artery is selected for access, the wrist will be prepared and accessed using medications to relax and dilate the vessel to allow the catheter to pass (<a href="#bib4292">Mason, Shah, Tamis-Holland, et al., 2018</a>). Fluoroscopy is used to guide the catheter to the appropriate vessels. Neurologic assessment is conducted during and immediately following cerebral angiography to observe for embolism or arterial dissection that may occur during the test. Signs of these complications include new onset of alterations in the level of consciousness, weakness on one side of the body, motor or sensory deficits, and speech disturbances.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care after cerebral angiography includes observation of the injection site for bleeding or hematoma formation (a localized collection of blood). Because a hematoma at the puncture site or embolization to a distal artery affects peripheral pulses, the peripheral pulses that were marked prior to the test are monitored frequently. The color and temperature of the involved extremity are assessed to detect possible embolism (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib4301">Mason et al., 2018</a>). Fluids are encouraged to facilitate clearance of the contrast through the kidney. The nurse also monitors for an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, as well as hypotension if vasodilatory medications were used to facilitate a radial approach (<a href="#bib4301">Mason et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2925">Myelography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A myelogram is an x-ray of the spinal subarachnoid space taken after the injection of a contrast agent into the spinal subarachnoid space through a lumbar puncture. The water-based contrast agent disperses upward through the CSF to outline the spinal subarachnoid space and shows any distortion of the spinal cord or spinal dural sac caused by tumors, cysts, herniated vertebral discs, or other lesions. Myelography is often followed by CT scanning (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is educated about what to expect during the procedure and made aware that changes in position may be made during the procedure. After myelography, the patient lies in bed with the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees. The patient is advised to remain in bed in the recommended position for 4 to 24 hours after testing. Drinking liberal amounts of fluid for rehydration and replacement of CSF may decrease the incidence of post&#x2013;lumbar puncture headache. The blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature are monitored, as well as the patient&#x2019;s ability to void. Complications that may occur include nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, stiff neck, seizures, paralysis of one side of the body, and changes in level of consciousness (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2926">Noninvasive Carotid Flow Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Noninvasive carotid flow studies use ultrasound imagery and Doppler measurements of arterial blood flow to evaluate carotid and deep orbital circulation. The graph produced indicates blood velocity. Increased blood velocity can indicate stenosis or partial obstruction. These tests are often obtained before more invasive tests such as arteriography or are used as screening tools. Carotid Doppler, carotid ultrasonography, oculoplethysmography, and ophthalmodynamometry are four common noninvasive vascular techniques that permit evaluation of arterial blood flow and detection of arterial stenosis, occlusion, and plaques. These vascular studies allow noninvasive imaging of extra- and intracranial circulation (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2927">Transcranial Doppler</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Transcranial Doppler uses the same noninvasive techniques as carotid flow studies but records the blood flow velocities of the intracranial vessels. Arterial flow velocities can be measured through thin areas of the temporal and occipital bones of the skull. A handheld Doppler probe emits a pulsed beam; the signal is reflected by the moving red blood cells within the blood vessels. Transcranial Doppler is a noninvasive technique that is helpful in assessing vasospasm (a complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage), altered cerebral blood flow found in occlusive vascular disease, other cerebral pathologies, and brain death.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When a carotid flow study or transcranial Doppler is scheduled, the procedure is described to the patient. The patient is informed that this is a noninvasive test, that a handheld transducer will be placed over the neck and the orbits of the eyes, and that a water-soluble gel or lubricant is used on the transducer (<a href="#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Either of these two low-risk tests can be performed at the patient&#x2019;s bedside.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2928">Electroencephalography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An electroencephalogram (EEG) represents a record of the electrical activity generated in the brain (<a href="#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). It is obtained through electrodes applied on the scalp or through microelectrodes placed within the brain tissue. It provides an assessment of cerebral electrical activity. It is useful for diagnosing and evaluating seizure disorders, coma, or organic brain syndrome. Tumors, brain abscesses, blood clots, and infection may cause abnormal patterns in electrical activity. The EEG is also used in making a determination of brain death.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrodes are applied to the scalp to record the electrical activity in various regions of the brain. The amplified activity of the neurons between any two of these electrodes is recorded on continuously moving paper; this record is called the <em>encephalogram.</em></p>
<p class="indent">For a baseline recording, the patient lies quietly with both eyes closed. The patient may be asked to hyperventilate for 3 to 4 minutes or to look at a bright, flashing light for photic stimulation. These activation procedures are performed to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1989" title="1989"></span>evoke abnormal electrical discharges, such as seizure potentials. A sleep EEG may be recorded after sedation because some abnormal brain waves are seen only when the patient is asleep. If the epileptogenic area is inaccessible to conventional scalp electrodes, nasopharyngeal electrodes may be used.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Electroencephalographic Patterns During Nursing Interventions in Neurointensive Care</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Elf, K., Carlsson, T., Santeliz Rivas, L., et al. (2019). Electroencephalographic patterns during common nursing interventions in neurointensive care: A descriptive pilot study. <em>Journal of Neuroscience Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>51</em>(1), 10&#x2013;15.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to identify changes on electroencephalography (EEG) during standard neurointensive nursing care.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study was a descriptive pilot study using a convenience sample of patients admitted to the neurointensive care unit with impaired consciousness due to a neurosurgical condition. The sample included 12 participants, with a mean age of 65 years with diagnoses of subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma, meningitis, ischemic infarction, or traumatic brain injury. All participants were mechanically ventilated, with continuous sedations and intracranial monitoring. The study design included the monitoring of simultaneous continuous EEG and video recording. The nursing interventions monitored included airway suctioning, repositioning, and when professionally touched for assessment of hygienic interventions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Four participants had seizure activity during four nursing interventions (0.4% of nursing interventions); one participant had stimulus-induced rhythmic discharges during an intervention. All 12 participants showed muscle artifacts during 353 nursing interventions (36.3%), which may be a sign of stress. Muscle artifacts happened during all types of nursing interventions but occurred most often when more than one intervention was performed.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients with neuroscience disorders in intensive care undergo many stressors, and the results of this study indicate that nursing interventions may cause stress in patients. Oral care, repositioning, suctioning, and hygienic care may cause stress. Nurses should be mindful of the comfort of the patient with a neuroscience disorder when delivering care at the bedside and consider shorter and fewer interventions in patients who are sensitive.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Depth recording of EEG is performed by introducing electrodes stereotactically (radiologically placed using instrumentation) into a target area of the brain, as indicated by the patient&#x2019;s seizure pattern and scalp EEG. It is used to identify patients who may benefit from surgical excision of epileptogenic foci. Special transsphenoidal, mandibular, and nasopharyngeal electrodes can be used, and video recording combined with EEG monitoring and telemetry is used in hospital settings to capture epileptiform abnormalities and their sequelae. Some epilepsy centers provide long-term ambulatory EEG monitoring with portable recording devices. Some evidence suggests that continuous EEG may be a useful tool for nurses planning interventions in patients who are critically ill (<a href="#bib4289">Elf, Carlsson, Santeliz Rivas, et al., 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct60-3">Chart 60-3</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To increase the chances of recording seizure activity, it is sometimes recommended that the patient be deprived of sleep the night before the EEG. Anticonvulsant agents, tranquilizers, stimulants, and depressants should be withheld 24 to 48 hours before an EEG, because these medications can alter the EEG wave patterns or mask the abnormal wave patterns of seizure disorders (<a href="#bib4301">Pagana &#x0026; Pagana, 2018</a>). Coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks are omitted from the meal before the test because of their stimulating effect. However, the meal itself is not omitted, because an altered blood glucose level can cause changes in brain wave patterns.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is informed that the standard EEG takes 45 to 60 minutes; a sleep EEG requires 12 hours. The patient is assured that the procedure does not cause an electric shock and that the EEG is a diagnostic test, not a form of treatment. An EEG requires the patient to lie quietly during the test. Sedation is not advisable, because it may lower the seizure threshold in patients with a seizure disorder and it alters brain wave activity in all patients. The nurse needs to check the prescription regarding the administration of anticonvulsant medication prior to testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Routine EEGs use a water-soluble lubricant for electrode contact, which can be wiped off and removed by shampooing later. Sleep EEGs involve the use of collodion glue for electrode contact, which requires acetone for removal.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2929">Electromyography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An electromyogram (EMG) is obtained by inserting needle electrodes into the skeletal muscles to measure changes in the electrical potential of the muscles (<a href="#bib4301">Pagana &#x0026; Pagana, 2018</a>). The electrical potentials are shown on an oscilloscope and amplified so that both the sound and appearance of the waves can be analyzed and compared simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">An EMG is useful in determining the presence of neuromuscular disorders and myopathies. It helps distinguish weakness due to neuropathy (functional or pathologic changes in the peripheral nervous system) from weakness resulting from other causes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The procedure is explained, and the patient is warned to expect a sensation similar to that of an intramuscular injection as the needle is inserted into the muscle. The muscles examined may ache for a short time after the procedure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2930">Nerve Conduction Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nerve conduction studies are performed by stimulating a peripheral nerve at several points along its course and recording the muscle action potential or the sensory action potential that results. Surface or needle electrodes are placed on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1990" title="1990"></span>the skin over the nerve to stimulate the nerve fibers. This test is useful in the study of peripheral neuropathies and is often included as part of the EMG.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2931">Evoked Potential Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Evoked potential studies involve application of an external stimulus to specific peripheral sensory receptors with subsequent measurement of the electrical potential generated. Electrical changes are detected with the aid of computerized devices that extract the signal, display it on an oscilloscope, and store the data on magnetic tape or disc. In neurologic diagnosis, they reflect nerve conduction times in the peripheral nervous system. In clinical practice, the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems are most often tested.</p>
<p class="indent">In visual evoked responses, the patient looks at a visual stimulus (flashing lights, a checkerboard pattern on a screen). The average of several hundred stimuli is recorded by EEG leads placed over the occipital lobe. The transit time from the retina to the occipital area is measured using computer-averaging methods.</p>
<p class="indent">Brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) are measured by applying an auditory stimulus (repetitive auditory click) and measuring the transit time via the brain stem into the cortex. Specific lesions in the auditory pathway modify or delay the response. BAERs may be used in the diagnosis of brain stem abnormalities and in determination of brain death.</p>
<p class="indent">In somatosensory evoked responses (SERs), the peripheral nerves are stimulated (electrical stimulation through skin electrodes) and the transit time along the spinal cord to the cortex is measured and recorded from scalp electrodes. SERs are used to detect deficits in spinal cord or peripheral nerve conduction and to monitor spinal cord function during surgical procedures. It is also useful in the diagnosis of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and polyneuropathies, where nerve conduction is slowed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse explains the procedure and reassures the patient and encourages him or her to relax. The patient is advised to remain perfectly still throughout the recording to prevent artifacts (signals not generated by the brain) that interfere with the recording and interpretation of the test.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2932">Lumbar Puncture and Examination of Cerebrospinal Fluid</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is carried out by inserting a needle into the lumbar subarachnoid space to withdraw CSF (<a href="#bib4301">Schreiber, 2019</a>). The test may be performed to obtain CSF for examination, to measure and reduce CSF pressure, to determine the presence or absence of blood in the CSF, and to administer medications intrathecally (into the spinal canal).</p>
<p class="indent">The needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space in the widest intervertebral spaces; between the second and third, the third and fourth, or fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae (<a href="#bib4301">Schreiber, 2019</a>). Because the spinal cord ends at the first lumbar vertebra, insertion of the needle below the level of the second lumbar vertebra prevents puncture of the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="indent">A lumbar puncture may be risky in the presence of an intracranial mass lesion because intraspinal pressure is decreased by removal of CSF, and the brain may herniate downward through the foramen magnum. A successful lumbar puncture requires that the patient be relaxed; a patient who is anxious is tense, and this may artificially alter the pressure reading. The nurse may be asked to assist with a lumbar puncture.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box1990"><img class="m" src="images/icon15le.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for assisting with a lumbar puncture, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The CSF should be clear and colorless. Pink, blood-tinged, or grossly bloody CSF may indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CSF may be bloody initially because of local trauma but becomes clearer as more fluid is drained (<a href="#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib4301">Schreiber, 2019</a>). Specimens are obtained for cell count, culture, glucose, protein, and other tests as indicated. The specimens should be sent to the inhibitor laboratory immediately because changes will take place and alter the result if the specimens are allowed to stand. See Table A-5 in Appendix A on <img class="m" src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/> for the normal values of CSF.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Post&#x2013;Lumbar Puncture Headache</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A post&#x2013;lumbar puncture headache, ranging from mild to severe, may occur a few hours to several days after the procedure. It is a throbbing bifrontal or occipital headache that is dull and deep in character. It is particularly severe on sitting or standing but lessens or disappears when the patient lies down.</p>
<p class="indent">The headache is caused by CSF leakage at the puncture site (<a href="#bib4301">Schreiber, 2019</a>). The fluid continues to escape into the tissues by way of the needle track from the spinal canal. As a result of a leak, the supply of CSF in the cranium is depleted to a point at which it is insufficient to maintain proper mechanical stabilization of the brain. When the patient assumes an upright position, tension and stretching of the venous sinuses and pain-sensitive structures occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Post&#x2013;lumbar puncture headache may be avoided if a small-gauge needle (22 gauge) is used (<a href="#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A post&#x2013;lumbar puncture headache is usually managed with analgesic agents, encouraging hydration, ingestion of caffeine, and lying supine (<a href="#bib4301">Schreiber, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Complications of Lumbar Puncture</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Herniation of the intracranial contents, spinal epidural abscess, spinal epidural hematoma, and meningitis are rare but serious complications of lumbar puncture. Other complications include temporary voiding problems, slight elevation of temperature, backache or spasms, and stiffness of the neck.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many diagnostic tests are carried out in short-procedure units or outpatient testing settings or units. As a result, family members often provide the postprocedure care. Therefore, the patient and family must receive adequate education about precautions to take after the procedure, complications <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1991" title="1991"></span>to watch for, and steps to take if complications occur. Because many patients undergoing neurologic diagnostic studies are older adults or have neurologic deficits, provisions must be made to ensure that transportation, postprocedure care, and appropriate monitoring are available.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuing and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Contacting the patient and family after diagnostic testing enables the nurse to determine whether they have any questions about the procedure or whether the patient had any untoward results. Education is reinforced and the patient and family are reminded to make and keep follow-up appointments. Patients, family members, and health care providers are focused on the immediate needs, issues, or deficits that necessitated the diagnostic testing.</p>
