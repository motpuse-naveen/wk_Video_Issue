<h4 class="h4" id="s2568">Assessment and Management of Patients Seeking Gender Reassignment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">People who are transgender may experience <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gender dysphoria:&lt;/b&gt; distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth">gender dysphoria</button></strong>, which is the distress caused by the dissonance between the person&#x2019;s gender identity and that person&#x2019;s sex assigned at birth. To assist people with this distress and find a gender role that is comfortable for them, treatment is available and may include medical and surgical interventions. Treatment is individualized, meaning that interventions that effectively <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1785" title="1785"></span>alleviate gender dysphoria in one patient may not work for a different patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Health care teams who provide psychological, medical, and surgical treatments to people who are transgender often follow the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH, 2012). Even though the latest version of the Standards of Care was released in 2012, at the time of this book print, it is still the leading resource for the care of people who are transgender. Other important resources include the Guidelines for the Primary and Gender-Affirming Care of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary People from the University of California, San Francisco (<a href="#bib3971">Deutsch, 2016</a>) and the Principles of Transgender Medicine and Surgery (<a href="#bib3971">Ettner, Monstrey, &#x0026; Coleman, 2016</a>) (see References and Resources sections at the end of the chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">Providing treatment to people who are seeking gender reassignment almost always starts with confirming a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Many health insurance companies require a gender dysphoria or related diagnosis before covering the costs of gender reassignment treatments. Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-5). <a href="#ct54-2">Chart&#x00A0;54-2</a> lists the criteria used to diagnose a person with gender dysphoria. In short, to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a person must exhibit specific thoughts and feelings about the incongruence of their gender identity and their secondary sex characteristics for a period of at least 6 months (<a href="#bib3903">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>). An experienced mental health care professional, such as a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, clinical social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist, can assess, diagnose, and provide psychological treatment for gender dysphoria. Before a health care provider prescribes medical or surgical treatments (e.g., hormones, gender reassignment surgery), they usually require that the person has consulted with a mental health care provider and received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.</p>

<p class="indent">When a person wants to address the distress or other negative emotions associated with having a gender that does not align with their sex assigned at birth (gender dysphoria), they will usually work with an interdisciplinary health care team. This team typically includes a mental health care professional, a health care provider experienced in endocrinology, and a surgeon. The mental health care professional will provide psychological support to the person during their gender identity journey; the endocrinology health care provider will prescribe hormones and monitor outcomes; the surgeon will handle gender reassignment surgeries. Depending on the treatment settings, nurses are involved in various capacities along the treatment continuum.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2569">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Hormone Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to alleviating gender dysphoria, the goal of hormone gender-affirming therapy is the acquisition of the secondary sex characteristics of the other gender, to the fullest extent possible (<a href="#bib3971">Gooren, 2016</a>). To achieve the secondary sex characteristics of the opposite gender, sex steroids/hormones are needed. There is no known difference in sensitivity to the action of sex hormones on the basis of genetics or gonadal/sex status (<a href="#bib3971">Gooren, 2016</a>), meaning that a person can develop secondary sex characteristics of the opposite gender by taking sex hormones. However, certain effects of sex hormones cannot be reversed. For example, in people who are transgender women (male to female), the previous effects of androgens on the skeleton (average greater height; size and shape of hands, feet, and jaw; and pelvic structure) cannot be reversed by hormones (<a href="#bib3971">Gooren, 2016</a>) (<a href="#tt54-2">Table&#x00A0;54-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are transgender women, estrogen is prescribed to produce the desired physical changes. The prescribed dose of estrogen is individualized and depends on many different factors, such as the patient&#x2019;s goals, risk/benefit ratio, presence of other medical conditions, presence or absence of gonads, and social and economic issues (WPATH, 2012). Estrogen treatment should produce changes in body hair, breast development, skin, body fat composition, muscle mass, testes, and prostate. In addition to estrogen, androgen-reducing medications to reduce testosterone levels are also often prescribed, which diminish masculine characteristics and minimize the dosage of estrogen needed to suppress testosterone. Common androgen-reducing medications include spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, GnRH agonists (e.g., goserelin, buserelin, triptorelin), and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) (WPATH, 2012). Progestogen does not add to the feminization process and is typically not recommended due to the higher incidence of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease (<a href="#bib3971">Gooren, 2016</a>). See Table&#x00A0;54-3 for commonly prescribed medications.</p>
<p class="indent">In people who are transgender men (female to male), testosterone is prescribed to produce the desired physical changes. Like estrogen, the prescribed dose of testosterone is individualized and depends on many different factors. Testosterone treatment should produce changes in scalp hair, skin oiliness, facial and body hair, voice, body fat composition, muscle mass, menses, clitoris, and vagina (see <a href="#tt54-2">Tables 54-2</a> and <a href="#tt54-3">54-3</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">As with any medical treatment, hormones carry risks to the person. The likelihood of a serious adverse event is dependent on numerous factors, such as dose, route of administration (e.g., oral vs. transdermal vs. intramuscular), and the patient&#x2019;s characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities, health behaviors). People who take estrogen are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), gallstones, elevated liver enzymes, weight gain, and hypertriglyceridemia. People <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1787" title="1787"></span>who take testosterone are at increased risk for polycythemia, weight gain, acne, androgenic alopecia (male-patterned balding), and sleep apnea. In addition, both estrogen and testosterone can increase the risk of the person developing type 2 diabetes when they have additional risk factors, such as older age (WPATH, 2012).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Hair Removal</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hormone treatment does not typically fully eliminate unwanted hair, and thus people who are transgender may seek additional gender-affirming medical procedures. Transgender women typically seek hair removal on the face, neck, and in the genital area as preoperative preparation for vaginoplasty. Transgender men typically seek hair removal on the forearm and thigh when needing graft sites for phalloplasty. Like hormone treatment, hair removal is associated with both decreased dysphoria and increased well-being among people who are transgender (<a href="#bib3971">Bradford, 2019</a>). Although numerous treatments exist to help manage unwanted hair, there are two primary medical procedures used for long-term treatment: laser hair removal and electrolysis (<a href="#bib3971">Reeves, Deutsch, &#x0026; Stark, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Laser hair removal is the leading therapy option for long-term results and works on the principle of selective photothermolysis, whereby photons destroy the hair follicle while sparing the surrounding tissue (<a href="#bib3971">Thomas &#x0026; Houreld, 2019</a>). The main risks of this procedure are overheating resulting in redness, blisters, and burns. Treatments should be avoided when photosensitizing medications are being used, such as acne medications (e.g., isotretinoin, minocycline, doxycycline), antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, sulfonamides, quinolones), and spironolactone. Nurses should review a patient&#x2019;s medication list and identify those that are photosensitive. Electrolysis involves the use of an electric current that destroys the root of individual hair follicles. This treatment is more time consuming and more painful than laser hair removal. The main risks of electrolysis are redness and pigment changes. To help manage the pain during laser hair removal and electrolysis, topical anesthetics (lidocaine-containing products) and acetaminophen are used (<a href="#bib3971">Reeves et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acne Treatment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In transgender men, testosterone is the mainstay of masculinizing hormonal therapy. Although the exact mechanism in the pathogenesis of acne is not yet fully understood, testosterone increases the production of sebum (oily secretion) in sebaceous glands, leading to acne. Facial acne in transgender men who use testosterone peaks within the first 4 months of treatment; over 80% of testosterone-treated transgender men experience facial acne in the first year (<a href="#bib3942">Motosko, Zakhem, Pomeranz, et al., 2018</a>). General guidelines for acne treatment can be followed for transgender men (<a href="#bib3953">Thiboutot, Dr&#x00E9;no, Abanmi, et al., 2018</a>); however, there are some specific considerations and risks. First, combining testosterone with some acne medications, especially minocycline, may lead to hepatotoxicity; thus, frequent monitoring of liver function tests is warranted. Second, some acne medications are teratogenic, such as minocycline, doxycycline, and isotretinoin. For transgender men who are still at risk of pregnancy (intact uterus and ovaries), careful sexual history and counseling should be performed before the initiation of any acne treatment. Third, some acne medications, especially isotretinoin, may delay wound healing and lead to keloid formation after surgery; thus, a discussion about surgical plans is needed before starting acne treatment (<a href="#bib3971">Motosko et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fertility and Reproductive Health</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many people who are transgender will want to have biological children, but because hormone treatment limits fertility, patients should be educated about their options before starting hormone treatment or undergoing surgery to remove or alter their reproductive organs. Although the long-term effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy using testosterone or estrogen on fertility are not known, limited research suggests that testosterone and estrogen can affect the reproductive abilities of ovaries and testes, respectively (<a href="#bib3922">Cheng, Pastuszak, Myers, et al., 2019</a>). There are cases of transgender women and men stopping hormone treatment and still having fertile oocytes or sperm; however, there are many cases to the contrary and thus patients who are transgender should be fully informed of the possible implications that hormones have on fertility and preservation options.</p>
<p class="indent">In the postpuberty age group, transgender men should be educated about oocyte cryopreservation, embryo cryopreservation, and uterus preservation. Transgender women should be educated about sperm cryopreservation. In the prepuberty age group, trials are ongoing to determine the effectiveness of ovarian tissue cryopreservation and testicular tissue cryopreservation in transgender men and transgender women, respectively (<a href="#bib3971">Cheng et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The synthesis and secretion of many endogenous hormones change and the expression of cell receptors in tissues changes in numbers and signaling capacity as the human body ages (<a href="#bib3971">Houlberg, 2019</a>). Although there is very little research on the effect of exogenous cross-sex hormones in older adults who are transgender, there are important considerations given the endocrine changes in aging bodies. The major consideration for nurses is the effects of sex steroids on the metabolism of medication. With aging, the metabolism and excretion of many drugs decrease (<a href="#bib3971">Ruscin &#x0026; Linnebar, 2018</a>). Sex hormones also influence the absorption, metabolism, pharmacodynamics, and adverse effects of medications (<a href="#bib3931">Gooren &#x0026; T&#x2019;Sjoen, 2018</a>). Nurses may need to take additional precautions to monitor for adverse effects and toxicity of certain medications when working with people who are transgender and taking exogenous sex hormones. The other two considerations are cardiovascular disease and bone health. In transgender women, estrogen increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Additional preventive screening is warranted in these patients and lowering the dose of estrogen in transgender women over the age of 55 should be considered. Lastly, cross-sex hormone treatment can decrease bone health in both transgender women and men (<a href="#bib3931">Gooren &#x0026; T&#x2019;Sjoen, 2018</a>). Findings from a pilot study suggest that despite having an increased risk for osteoporosis, transgender individuals&#x2019; knowledge of their risks for osteoporosis can be poor (<a href="#bib3946">Sedlak, Roller, van Dulmen, et al., 2017</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct54-3">Chart&#x00A0;54-3</a>). To help reduce the risk of reduced bone mineral density, nurses should educate about osteoporosis risks and promote physical exercise and intake of vitamin D and calcium to people who are transgender and taking sex hormones (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for further discussion of osteoporosis). Given these considerations, the risks of hormone treatment can be managed and rarely pose an absolute contraindication (<a href="#bib3971">Houlberg, 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Osteoporosis Prevention Among Transgender Persons</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Sedlak, C. A., Roller, C. G., van Dulmen, M., et al. (2017). Transgender individuals and osteoporosis prevention. <em>Orthopaedic Nursing</em>, <em>36</em>(4), 259&#x2013;268.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Many people who are transgender take sex hormones in order to achieve desirable characteristics of the gender that they feel is consonant with their personal identity. An adverse effect of these medications is that bone mineral density can become prematurely depleted, leading to early osteoporosis. The purpose of this mixed methods pilot study was to identify osteoporosis knowledge, beliefs, and prevention behaviors among transgender adults.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants were recruited by advertising flyers at LGBTQ community centers and by advertising via LGBTQ support groups on the Internet. In order to be included in the study, participants had to be at least 30 years of age, the age when bone mineral density is considered maximal. Eligible participants could identify with male or female gender, and had to be able to read and speak English. Thirty-one participants were recruited and consented to complete a survey, which included a series of scales such as the <em>Osteoporosis Knowledge Test,</em> the <em>Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale,</em> the <em>Osteoporosis Self-Efficacy Scale,</em> the <em>Dietary Calcium Rapid Assessment Tool,</em> and the <em>Yale Physical Activity Survey.</em> Fifteen of these participants were randomly selected to participate in online qualitative interviews that focused on their views of bone health and osteoporosis.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The majority of participants (90.3%) took sex hormones. Most participants had poor knowledge of their osteoporosis risks, with 81% receiving failing scores on the <em>Osteoporosis Knowledge Test.</em> Participants selected to partake in the interviews confirmed that their knowledge of osteoporosis and their knowledge of their osteoporosis risks were poor. Several expressed frustration that health care providers had not disclosed these risks to them previously. The mean daily dietary calcium intake for the sample was less than recommended standards as was the minutes of average daily exercise. Most participants were not taking vitamin D supplements. Of those participants who were taking vitamin D supplements, more than half were taking less than recommended dosages.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Sex hormones are commonly taken by persons who are transgender; yet, findings from this study suggest that few people who are transgender and take sex hormones have knowledge of their associated higher risk for osteoporosis. Nurses should educate people who are transgender regarding the risk for osteoporosis that is associated with sex hormones. In addition, nurses should encourage persons who are transgender and taking sex hormones to engage in strategies that can mitigate the effects of sex hormones on their bone mineral density, including increasing their dietary calcium and physical activities, and taking appropriate dosages of vitamin D supplements.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">People who are transgender have many different gender reassignment surgeries available to them as they <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;transition:&lt;/b&gt; process of aligning a person&#x2019;s gender expression with their self-identified gender identity, which can include social, medical, surgical, and legal changes">transition</button></strong> from their sex assigned at birth to their gender identity (<a href="#tt54-4">Table&#x00A0;54-4</a>). Just like hormone treatment, gender reassignment surgeries help reduce gender dysphoria and improve quality of life. The WPATH (2012) recommends that people who are seeking gender reassignment surgeries meet certain criteria. They recommend that the person seeking surgery have (a) persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria; (b) capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment; (c) age of majority in a given country; and (d) any significant medical or mental health concerns be well controlled. For certain surgeries, including hysterectomy, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty, WPATH (2012) also recommends that the person has had 12 continuous months of hormone therapy and has had 12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity. This is based on clinical consensus, not empirical evidence, that living 12 months in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity gives them ample opportunity to experience and socially adjust before undergoing irreversible surgery (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, Bonte, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Male-to-Female Gender Reassignment Surgeries</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are numerous different gender reassignment surgeries for transgender women (see <a href="#tt54-4">Table&#x00A0;54-4</a>). Over the years, researchers have identified common differences between male and female faces. Typically, the female face is oval and heart-shaped with smooth lines, pointed chin, less pronounced mandibular angles, less nasal prominence, and less angular nasal tip (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>). For people who desire a more feminine face, surgeries are available to modify most structures in the face. Chondrolaryngoplasty, reducing the prominent thyroid cartilage, commonly referred to as the Adam&#x2019;s apple, and feminizing the voice are commonly desired changes in people who are male-to-female transgender; both surgeries can be performed during the same procedure. Feminizing the voice involves shortening the vocal cord length or increasing the vocal cord tension (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">For most transgender women, breast augmentation greatly increases subjective feelings of femininity. Surgeons typically recommend the person take estrogen for at least 12 months prior to the surgery to maximize breast growth and obtain better aesthetic results. Mammogenesis in transgender women receiving estrogen follows a pattern like the Tanner stages of breast development (see Breast Assessment in <a href="c52.xhtml">Chapter 52</a> for discussion of Tanner stages). Although there are some sexual differences in chest wall and mammary anatomy, the implantation of breast prostheses is not very different from breast augmentation in a female natal patient. The incision is typically made axillary, inframammary, or periareolar. The implant is created behind the glandular tissue or behind the pectoralis muscle (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some transgender women choose to have genital reassignment surgery. The goal of genital reassignment surgery in transgender women is to create a perineogenital complex as feminine in appearance and function as possible and free of poorly healed areas, scars, and neuromas. To achieve this goal, two procedures are required, including an orchiectomy (removal of the testicles) and vaginoplasty. The major steps of a vaginoplasty (<a href="#ff54-3">Fig.&#x00A0;54-3</a>) include amputation of the penis, creation of the neovaginal cavity and the lining, reconstruction of a urethral meatus, and construction of the labia and clitoris (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>). Lining the neovaginal cavity requires either a skin flap or skin graft. The penile&#x2013;scrotal skin flap, or penile inversion vaginoplasty, is the technique of choice and involves inverting the penile and scrotal skin (<a href="#bib3971">Ferrando, 2018</a>). If the skin graft technique is used by the surgeon, skin tissue can be harvested from numerous different areas on the body, such as the penile or scrotal area, abdomen, intestines, or buccal mucosa.</p>
<p class="indent">The goals of postoperative care of the patient undergoing male-to-female genital reassignment surgery are to prevent complications and infection and to ensure patency of the neovaginal cavity. After surgery, the patient typically remains in bed for five days with a vaginal dilator in place while receiving subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (e.g., enoxaparin; see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion on anticoagulation medications). After the fifth day, the dilator is periodically removed and daily cleansing of the neovaginal cavity begins. The patient will typically remain in the hospital for 8 days. After discharge, the patient is educated on how to dilate and cleanse their vaginal cavity for 3 to 6 months. Once fully healed, the patient can begin having penetrative vaginal intercourse and stop using the vaginal dilator. If the patient does not engage in regular intercourse, they will need to continue using the vaginal dilator (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Female-to-Male Gender Reassignment Surgeries</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are also numerous different gender reassignment surgeries for transgender men (see <a href="#tt54-4">Table&#x00A0;54-4</a>). Male-sexed faces tend to have larger facial skeletons, be squarer with sharper angles and stronger jaws. Although facial masculinization procedures are far less common than facial feminization, surgeries are available to modify the forehead, angle of the mandible, chin, and cheekbones. Although the vocal cords can be surgically modified to reduce tension resulting in a more masculine voice, most people who are transgender male achieve their desired voice through testosterone treatment and behavioral therapies (<a href="#bib3971">Irwig, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib3971">Schneider &#x0026; Courey, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Testosterone treatment has little effect on reducing breast size, thus transgender men who desire a flat chest require a subcutaneous mastectomy (<a href="#ff54-4">Fig.&#x00A0;54-4</a>). From an anatomical standpoint, subcutaneous mastectomy in transgender males is nearly identical to mastectomies for breast disease. The main difference is the removal of breast tissue and excess skin and reduction and repositioning of the nipple and areola to create an aesthetically pleasing male chest (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, Weijers, et al., 2016</a>). The complication rate of subcutaneous mastectomy is very low and carries similar risk to mastectomies for breast disease (<a href="#bib3925">Cuccolo, Kang, Boskey, et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c52.xhtml">Chapter 52</a> for further discussion on mastectomy).</p>

<p class="indent">Some transgender men choose to have phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis. The goals of phalloplasty include (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, et al., 2016</a>):</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>having an aesthetic appearing penis,</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>achieving tactile and erogenous sensation,</span></li>
<li><span>having the ability to urinate while standing, and</span></li>
<li><span>having the ability to have an erection and engage in penetrative intercourse.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Phalloplasty is a complicated surgery that involves numerous subprocedures. Although the selection of subprocedures will depend on the patient&#x2019;s goals, they typically include phallic shaft creation, penile urethroplasty, urethral lengthening, perineoplasty (reconstructing the perineum), scrotoplasty, vaginectomy, hysterectomy and oophorectomy, glansplasty (constructing the head of penis), testicular implants, and erectile device implant (<a href="#bib3932">Heston, Esmonde, Dugi, et al., 2019</a>). To help retain erogenous sensation and the ability to achieve orgasm, surgeons try to maintain clitoral nerves. Patients can also elect to have clitoral transposition where the clitoris is placed in a superficial location just below the surface of the neophallus.</p>
<p class="indent">Constructing the penis requires a flap of skin to be excised from either the radial forearm or anterolateral thigh. The forearm skin flap is considered as the standard in penis construction (<a href="#ff54-5">Fig.&#x00A0;54-5</a>), but some patients may choose the thigh to avoid having a wide circumferential scar on the forearm. Due to the size of the skin flap excised from the forearm or thigh, postoperative monitoring and care is imperative to prevent infection and complications. After surgery, the patient typically remains in bed for 1 week with a suprapubic urinary diversion and transurethral catheter. The patient may be prescribed an LMWH agent, such as enoxaparin, during this time frame. However, pelvic or groin hematomas sometimes develop postphalloplasty, which must then be managed by either drains or surgical drainage, and thus the individual risks versus the benefits of prescribing an LMWH agent are carefully considered (<a href="#bib3971">Crane, 2016</a>). After the 1-week mark, the transurethral catheter is removed, and the suprapubic catheter is clamped so the patient can begin voiding. The patient will typically remain hospitalized for 2 to 3 weeks after a phalloplasty for close monitoring. To increase the aesthetic aspect of the phalloplasty, the patient may choose to tattoo the glans (head) of the penis after it has healed. Tattooing the glans allows for more natural coloring (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous challenges to achieving the last two goals of phalloplasty; namely, to urinate while standing and to achieve an erection. There have been many reported complications in patients who had urethral lengthening through construction of a neourethra, especially postoperative urethra fistulas and strictures/stenoses. Further, the long-term effects of urethral lengthening on bladder function is unknown. Lifelong follow-up with a urologist is usually required. Achieving rigidity (erection) after a phalloplasty remains a real challenge. There are numerous surgical approaches to creating rigidity, each with unique limitations and complications. One of the more common approaches is implanting an erectile device. Although infections can be a problem with penile implants, the latest erectile devices show promise in being durable and allowing the person to achieve an erection and sexual pleasure (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, et al., 2016</a>) (for further discussion of penile implants, see <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a>, <a href="c53-sec04.xhtml#tt53-2">Table&#x00A0;53-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative technique to phalloplasty is metoidioplasty, which uses the clitoris to construct a microphallus. In metoidioplasty, the clitoris is detached from the pubic bone, allowing it to extend out further. This approach usually requires at least 12 months of testosterone treatment, which results in a hormonally hypertrophied clitoris. Metoidioplasty is the only procedure that enables creation of male genitalia with completely preserved protective and erogenous sensitivity. This means that the sexual sensation of the clitoris is preserved and intact, which differs from a phalloplasty that often requires reconstruction or transposition of the clitoris. The scrotum is usually created from labia majora flaps allowing for testicular implants. Compared to phalloplasty, metoidioplasty has a shorter hospital stay and minimal donor site complications. However, metoidioplasty does not allow the person to void while standing nor engage in penetrative sex (<a href="#bib3971">Djinovic, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Preoperatively, the nurse should first gather details about the patient&#x2019;s gender identity, preferred name, preferred pronouns, and surgery. A person who is undergoing gender reassignment surgery will likely feel vulnerable and emotional. Gender reassignment surgery is a monumental moment for a person who is transgender. The nurse needs to ensure the patient and their family feel welcomed and safe. Using gender-neutral language (see <a href="c54-sec04.xhtml#tt54-1">Table&#x00A0;54-1</a>) and properly assessing for gender identity and pronouns (see <a href="c54-sec04.xhtml#ct54-1">Chart&#x00A0;54-1</a>) is imperative to creating a welcoming environment.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Preoperatively, the nurse ensures the patient has received education and counseling about their gender reassignment surgery, the possible risks and benefits, including complications, postsurgical outcomes, and need for possible long-term follow-up appointments. The nurse needs to assess the last time the patient took their hormone treatment (e.g., estrogen or testosterone) because certain procedures require the patient to stop hormones 2 to 3 weeks in advance of surgery. The nurse should ensure the patient completed their bowel preparation, especially in genital reassignment surgery. For patients undergoing phalloplasty, the nurse needs to assess smoking status because most surgeons require the patient to be free of tobacco products or inhaling nicotine and marijuana. This includes electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, et al., 2016</a>). Laboratory results, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine, should be assessed; however, the nurse should be aware that people who receive hormones may have alterations in their laboratory values (<a href="#bib3955">Tollinche, Walters, Radix, et al., 2018</a>). For patients who are transitioning, regardless of whether the transition is female to male or male to female, the upper limit for creatinine, hemoglobin and hematocrit, and alkaline phosphatase should be based on male values. For patients who are transitioning from female to male, the lower limit of hemoglobin and hematocrit should be based on male values. For patients who are transitioning from male to female, the lower limit of hemoglobin and hematocrit should be based on female values (WPATH, 2012).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Postoperatively, the nurse assesses the patient to ensure the goals for recovery are met and that the patient exhibits absence of complications secondary to the surgical procedure(s). Gender reassignment surgeries often require very specific assessments to ensure proper healing and prevent complications. It is imperative that the nurse follow the surgeon&#x2019;s prescribed postoperative care guidelines and educate the patient to prevent both complications and revisional surgeries (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include enhanced sense of dignity and respect, reduction of anxiety about the surgery and postoperative care, relief of pain, absence of infection, enhancement of hope related to life after surgery, effective peripheral tissue perfusion, and absence of postoperative complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>E<small>NSURING</small> H<small>UMAN</small> D<small>IGNITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse needs to promote a welcoming and safe environment for the patient undergoing gender reassignment surgery. In addition, the nurse needs to promote the use of gender-neutral language, preferred third-person pronouns, and utmost respect for the patient and their family (<a href="#bib3934">Johnson, Wakefield, &#x0026; Garthe, 2020</a>). The patient should be able to safely disclose their gender identity and sexual orientation. In addition, nurses and other health care providers should avoid having discussions about the patient that can be overheard by neighboring patients and staff who are not involved in care. While this principle should be applied to all patients, it is of the utmost importance to the care of people who are transgender because of concerns over discriminatory health care treatment (<a href="#bib3971">Tollinche et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">People who are transgender should be roomed in accordance with their gender identity. Careful communication between the nurse and individuals responsible for room assignments (e.g., charge nurse) is necessary. If a private room is available, it should be offered as an option because it will provide increased privacy and comfort to the patient. However, the patient should not be forced into a private room because it may make the patient feel isolated (<a href="#bib3971">Tollinche et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse provides the patient preparing for gender reassignment surgery anticipatory guidance as to what to expect during the surgery and postoperatively. The patient&#x2019;s preferred family should be included when possible to help reduce anxiety. Additionally, some surgery centers promote the use of relaxation techniques, such as aromatherapy, nature sounds, and relaxation exercises; the nurse should use these if available (<a href="#bib3928">Ertug, Olusoylu, Bal, et al., 2017</a>). People who are transgender are often connected to larger networks, but the nurse can promote local and online support groups. Often, online support groups can become the main support resource after gender reassignment surgery (<a href="#bib3971">Cipolletta, Votadoro, &#x0026; Faccio, 2017</a>) (see Resources section).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Additionally, to help ease the patient&#x2019;s anxiety about postoperative care, the nurse can assist in coordinating services. People who are transgender have higher rates of anxiety and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1792" title="1792"></span>depression than cisgender people. These issues may be exacerbated during a prolonged hospital stay. Thus, the nurse should advocate for the involvement of mental health, social work, and spiritual care as needed to address all of the patient&#x2019;s needs (<a href="#bib3971">Tollinche et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Evidence shows that patients experiencing postoperative pain should be offered multimodal analgesia, which is the pharmacologic method of combining various groups of medications for pain relief (<a href="#bib3936">Manworren, Gordon, &#x0026; Montgomery, 2018</a>) (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion). After surgery, patients are usually prescribed opioid (morphine, hydromorphone) and nonopioid (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) agents. The nurse can administer these agents as prescribed to relieve pain and discomfort. Inadequately controlled postoperative pain can impede functional recovery and reduce quality of life (<a href="#bib3936">Manworren et al., 2018</a>), thus nurses need to be vigilant about controlling the patient&#x2019;s pain. Patients undergoing genital reassignment surgery typically need to stay in bed for numerous days; thus, the nurse should help the patient reposition themselves to promote comfort.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING AND</small> M<small>ONITORING FOR</small> I<small>NFECTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Unless the patient undergoing gender reassignment surgery has risk factors (e.g., older adult, weak immune system, smoker, poor nutrition, overweight), they are not at greater risk for developing a postsurgical infection. The nurse should follow usual procedures to prevent and monitor for infection. Preventing infection after surgery requires proper and frequent hand hygiene, maintenance of the surgical site, and administration of prescribed prophylactic antibiotics. Early signs of infection should be reported to the surgeon immediately, including increased skin redness, pain, or swelling, cloudy or discolored discharge from the surgical site, and fever.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OPE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">People who are transgender often experience greater levels of depression and decreased quality of life as compared with cisgender people. However, people who undergo gender reassignment surgery often experience improved quality of life (<a href="#bib3918">Cai, Hughto, Reisner, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3971">Passos, Teixeira, &#x0026; Almeida-Santos, 2019</a>). The nurse should promote open communication about the patient&#x2019;s feelings, hopes, and goals after their gender reassignment surgery and show a positive regard and sense of hope for the patient. Additionally, the nurse may want to explore unresolved emotions or anxieties.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After surgery, the nurse assesses the patient for complications from the procedure, such as hemorrhage, VTE, and tissue necrosis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Hemorrhage.</span> Postoperative hemorrhage is a possible complication after gender reassignment surgery, especially following vaginectomy, which is one of the procedures during a phalloplasty (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, et al., 2016</a>). Signs and symptoms of possible hemorrhage include increased pain, frank red blood from the surgical site or rectum, increase in bloody output from any drain that might be in place (e.g., for mastectomy), and typical clinical manifestations (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness, syncope).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Venous Thromboembolism.</span> People who undergo gender reassignment surgery, especially those undergoing genital surgery and those who are transgender women, are at risk of VTE, including both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (<a href="#bib3971">Shatzel, Connelly, &#x0026; DeLoughery, 2017</a>). People who undergo genital reassignment surgery often need to stay in bed for up to 7 days, putting them especially at risk. Additionally, the estrogen hormone treatment among transgender women increases the risk. The patient is typically prescribed mechanical compression (e.g., intermittent pneumatic compression devices) and prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous LMWH agents (e.g., enoxaparin) during hospitalization. Even with these prophylactic measures, some patients still develop DVT and PE, and thus the nurse should monitor for clinical signs (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib3971">Shatzel et al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion on VTE).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Tissue Necrosis.</span> Tissue necrosis from vascular compromise is a complication with certain gender reassignment surgeries, including subcutaneous mastectomy and phalloplasty. After the subcutaneous mastectomy, vascular compromise may occur around the reconstructed nipple and areola (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, Verhaeghe, et al., 2016</a>). After the phalloplasty, vascular compromise may occur in the reconstructed shaft, penis glans, or scrotum (<a href="#bib3904">Colebunders, D&#x2019;Arpa, et al., 2016</a>). Signs of tissue necrosis from vascular compromise include skin/tissue discoloration (blue or black), feeling cool to the touch, increased pain or decreased sensation, and poor wound healing. Tissue necrosis is a medical emergency that needs to be addressed immediately.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> People who undergo gender reassignment surgery are typically discharged to home from the hospital within seven days after surgery. General postoperative discharge education includes promptly notifying the surgeon for a temperature greater than 38&#x00B0;C (100.4&#x00B0;F) or for the presence of unusual or bloody drainage from the wound(s). The patient is encouraged to advance the diet as tolerated at home to promote wound healing and to abstain from all tobacco products at least until the surgical wound(s) has healed. Additional education provided is dependent upon the nature of the surgery. For instance, the patient who has had a vaginoplasty or phalloplasty will receive very specific education (<a href="#ct54-4">Charts 54-4</a> and <a href="#ct54-5">54-5</a>). If the patient has had a mastectomy and has a drain in place, then the patient needs to be educated on managing the drain at home (see <a href="c52.xhtml">Chapter 52</a>, <a href="c52-sec13.xhtml#ct52-7">Chart&#x00A0;52-7</a>: Home Care Checklist: Patient with a Drainage Device Following Breast Surgery).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is discharged with specific instructions about follow-up appointments, including visits with their surgical, medical, and psychosocial providers to address their complex needs. Nurses should advocate that these follow-up appointments be made prior to hospital discharge. Additionally, the discharge process should assist the patient in coordinating any type of necessary equipment pickup, transportation to follow-up appointments, and filling medication prescriptions, as needed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Gender reassignment surgery is very complex, involves numerous different procedures, and can be different from surgeon to surgeon. For these reasons, it is impossible to describe every postsurgical self-care activity. The nurse needs to carefully review the discharge instructions provided by the surgical team. Genital reassignment surgery often has very specific self-care requirements of the patient. The nurse&#x2019;s role is to ensure the patient fully understands the self-care instructions and knows how to monitor for complications.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The patient will usually continue to see their surgeon for follow-up appointments for many months. Some procedures, such as a phalloplasty, may require follow-up appointments for up to a year after surgery. The patient will typically need lifelong hormonal treatment and should continue to follow-up with their endocrinology health care provider.
