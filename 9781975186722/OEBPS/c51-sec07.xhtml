<h4 class="h4" id="s2345">Herpes Virus Type 2 Infection (Herpes Genitalis, Herpes Simplex Virus)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is a recurrent, lifelong viral infection that causes herpetic lesions (blisters) on the external genitalia and occasionally the vagina and cervix. It is an STI but possibly may also be transmitted asexually from wet surfaces or by self-transmission (i.e., touching a cold sore and then touching the genital area). The initial infection is usually very painful, and blisters may take 2 to 4 weeks to heal, but it can also be asymptomatic. Over 87% of infected individuals are unaware of their infection; most HSV transmission occurs from asymptomatic viral shedding (CDC, 2017b). Recurrences are less painful, self-limited, and usually produce less severe symptoms. Some patients have few or no recurrences, whereas others have frequent bouts (CDC, 2017b). Recurrences can be associated with stress, sunburn, dental work, or inadequate rest or poor nutrition, or any situations that tax the immune system.</p>
<p class="indent">There are more than 400 million people affected by HSV-2 worldwide (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Cohen, 2017</a>). The prevalence of other STIs has decreased slightly, possibly because of increased condom use, but herpes can be transmitted by contact with skin that is not covered by a condom. Transmission is possible even when a carrier does not have symptoms (subclinical shedding). Lesions increase vulnerability to HIV infection and other STIs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2346">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that is differentiated into two types of HSV infection (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). These include herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), usually associated with cold sores of the lips (herpes labialis) and gingivostomatitis as well as herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2), usually associated with genital herpes.</p>
<p class="indent">Close human contact by the mouth, oropharynx, mucosal surface, vagina, or cervix appears necessary to acquire the infection. Other susceptible sites are skin lacerations and conjunctivae. Usually, the virus is killed at room temperature by drying. When viral replication diminishes, the virus ascends the peripheral sensory nerves and remains inactive in the nerve ganglia. Another outbreak may occur when the host is subjected to stress. In women who are pregnant and have active herpes, infants delivered vaginally may become infected with the virus. There is a risk of fetal morbidity and mortality if this occurs; therefore, a cesarean delivery may be performed if the virus recurs near the time of delivery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2347">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Itching and pain occur as the infected area becomes red and edematous. Infection may begin with macules and papules and progress to vesicles and ulcers. The vesicular state often appears as a blister, which later coalesces, ulcerates, and encrusts. In women, the labia are the usual primary site, although the cervix, vagina, and perianal skin may be affected. In men, the glans penis, foreskin, or penile shaft is typically affected. Influenzalike symptoms may occur 3 or 4 days after the lesions appear. Inguinal lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes in the groin), minor temperature elevation, malaise, headache, myalgia (aching muscles), and dysuria (pain on urination) are often noted. Pain is evident during the first week and then decreases. The lesions last 2 to 12 days before crusting over (CDC, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent">Rarely, complications may arise from extragenital spread, such as to the buttocks, upper thighs, or even the eyes, as a result of touching lesions and then touching other areas. Patients should be advised to wash their hands after contact with lesions. Other potential problems are aseptic meningitis, neonatal transmission, and severe emotional stress related to the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2348">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Currently, there is no cure for genital herpes infection, but treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. Management goals include preventing the spread of infection, making patients comfortable, decreasing potential health risks, and initiating a counseling and education program. Three oral antiviral agents&#x2014;acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir&#x2014;can suppress symptoms and shorten the course of the infection (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">King, 2017</a>). These agents are effective at reducing the duration of lesions and preventing recurrences. Antispasmodic agents and a saline compress can provide additional relief of symptoms. Resistance and long-term side effects do not appear to be major problems. Recurrent episodes are often milder than the initial episode. Prophylactic vaccine and topical gel development for genital herpes continues to be investigated in clinical trials (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">King, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The health history and a physical and pelvic examination are important in establishing the nature of the infectious condition. In addition, patients are assessed for risk of STIs. The perineum is inspected for painful lesions. Inguinal nodes are assessed and are often enlarged and tender during an occurrence of genital herpes.</p>

<div class="box15-a">
<p class="Box15pTitle_R">Strategies for the Patient with Genital Herpes</p>
<p class="p-txt15">Herpes is transmitted mainly by direct contact. Sexual activity during a herpes outbreak not only increases the risk of transmission but also increases the likelihood of contracting HIV and other STIs. The patient therefore takes the following measures:</p>
<p class="Box15BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Abstains from sexual activity during treatment for active disease (other options such as hand-holding and kissing are acceptable).</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoids exposure to the sun, which can cause recurrences (and skin cancer).</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoids self-infection by not touching lesions during an outbreak.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Uses barrier methods when engaging in sexual activity to provide protection against viral transmission.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Informs sexual partners of herpes diagnosis as transmission is possible even in the absence of active lesions.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Informs obstetric care provider about the history of genital herpes. In cases of recurrence at time of delivery, cesarean section may be considered.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Utilizes available support services (see Resources section).</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keeps follow-up appointments with health care provider, and reports repeated recurrences (may not be as severe as the initial episode).</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Takes medication prescribed for outbreaks and avoids occlusive ointments, strong perfumed soaps, or bubble bath.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Takes aspirin and other analgesic agents to control pain during outbreaks.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Uses the appropriate hygiene practices including hand hygiene, perineal cleanliness, gentle washing of lesions with mild soap and running water and lightly drying lesions (i.e., lesions can become infected from germs on the hand, and the virus from the lesion can be transmitted from the hand to another area of the body or another person).</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wears loose, comfortable clothing; eats a balanced diet; ingests adequate fluids gets adequate rest during outbreaks.</p>
<p class="b-foot">HIV, human immune deficiency virus; STIs, sexually transmitted infections.</p>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is encouraged to increase fluid intake, to be alert for possible bladder distention, and to contact her primary provider immediately if she cannot void because of discomfort. Painful voiding may occur if urine comes in contact with the herpes lesions. Discomfort with urination can be reduced by pouring warm water over the vulva during voiding. When oral antiviral agents are prescribed, the patient is instructed about when to take the medication and what side effects to note, such as rash and headache.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> I<small>NFECTION AND</small> I<small>TS</small> S<small>PREAD</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The risk of reinfection and spread of infection to others or to other structures of the body can be reduced by proper hand hygiene, the use of barrier methods with sexual contact, and adherence to prescribed medication regimens. Avoidance of contact when obvious lesions are present does not eliminate the risk because the virus can be shed in the absence of symptoms, and lesions may not be visible.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Concern about the presence of herpes infection, future occurrences of lesions, and the impact of the infection on future relationships and childbearing may cause considerable patient anxiety. Nurses serve as important sources of support by listening to patients&#x2019; concerns and providing information and education. The patient may be angry with her partner if the partner is the probable source of the infection. The patient may need assistance in discussing the infection and its implications with her current sexual partners and in future sexual relationships. The nurse can provide the patient with contact details for support services to assist in coping with the diagnosis (see the Resources section).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>NCREASING</small> K<small>NOWLEDGE</small> A<small>BOUT THE</small> D<small>ISEASE AND</small> I<small>TS</small> T<small>REATMENT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patient education is an essential part of nursing care of the patient with a genital herpes infection. This includes an adequate explanation about the infection and how it is transmitted, management and treatment strategies, strategies to minimize spread of infection, the importance of adherence to the treatment regimen, and self-care strategies. Because of the increased risk of HIV and other STIs in the presence of skin lesions, an important part of education involves informing the patient of strategies to protect herself from exposure to HIV and other STIs.</p>
