<h4 class="h4" id="s3133">Home-Based Care of the Patient with an Infectious Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse who cares for the patient with an infectious disease in the home should provide information about infection risk prevention to the patient, the family, and the caregiver (see <a href="#ct66-4">Chart&#x00A0;66-4</a>). Recognizing that a health history may not identify all active or latent infections, the caregiver should carefully follow standard precautions in the home. The nurse should establish a work environment that facilitates hand hygiene and aseptic technique.</p>
<p class="indent">Family caregivers should receive an annual influenza vaccine. This is especially true if the caregiver or the patient is older than 50 years, has underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, or has underlying immunosuppression.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients requiring home care are often people with immunosuppression from underlying conditions, such as HIV infection or cancer, or those who have treatment-induced immunosuppression, as occurs with many antineoplastic agents. Careful assessment for signs of infection is important.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3134">Reducing Risk to the Patient</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Equipment Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">All caregivers must pay careful attention to disinfection and aseptic technique while providing care and using medical equipment. Catheter-related sepsis should be suspected in a patient who has unexplained fever, redness, swelling, and drainage around a vascular catheter insertion site. Indwelling urinary catheters should be discontinued whenever possible, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2158" title="2158"></span>because each day of use increases the risk of infection. The nurse should promptly report signs of urinary tract infection or generalized sepsis to the patient&#x2019;s primary provider.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Patient Education</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When assessing the risk of infection in the home environment of the patient who is immunosuppressed, it is important to realize that intrinsic colonizing bacteria and latent viral infections present a greater risk than do extrinsic environmental contaminants. The nurse should reassure the patient and family that their home needs to be clean but not sterile. Family members seldom need to use masks, gowns, or other elements of PPE. Commonsense approaches to cleanliness and risk reduction are helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with neutropenia or T-cell dysfunction (e.g., patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), it is wise to restrict visits of people with potentially contagious illnesses. The patient who is immunosuppressed is vulnerable to acquiring bacterial infection with enteric pathogens from food; therefore, family members should be reminded about the need to follow recommendations for hygiene, storage, and safe cooking times and temperatures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3135">Reducing Risk to Household Members</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Establishing reasonable barriers to infection transmission in the household is an important part of home care. The route of transmission of the organism in question must first be determined. The nurse can then educate household members about strategies to reduce their risk of becoming infected. If the patient has active pulmonary TB, the public health department should be contacted to provide screening and treatment for family members. If the patient has herpes zoster, family members who have had varicella vaccine or who have previously had chickenpox are considered immune and need no precautions. However, if a family member is immunosuppressed or otherwise susceptible to varicella, maintaining physical separation is an important strategy during the time when the patient has draining lesions. When the patient is infected with enteric organisms, the family should be reassured that common household disinfectants are effective in controlling environmental contamination.</p>
<p class="indent">Family members who assist in the care of a patient with a bloodborne infection such as HIV or hepatitis C can prevent transmission by carefully handling any sharp objects that are contaminated with blood. Family education may include discussion about the need for caution when shaving the patient, performing dressing changes, or administering any IV or injected medication. To collect and dispose of used needles, syringes, and vascular access equipment, the family should use containers designed for sharps disposal. With the exception of TB, the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS do not usually pose a risk to the healthy family member. Family members should be reassured that dishes are safe to use after being washed with hot water and that linens and clothing are safe to use after being washed in a hot water cycle.</p>

</div>
<div class="box3">
<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Assessing for Infectious Disease</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse should ask the patient the following questions:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have a history of previous or recurrent infections?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have you had fever? How high has your temperature been? Is your temperature constant, or does it rise and fall? Has fever been associated with chills? Have you taken any medication to relieve fever?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have a cough? Is the cough chronic or acute? Is it associated with shortness of breath? Does the cough produce sputum? Is the sputum bloody? Have you had a tuberculin skin test recently or blood test to detect tuberculosis (TB)? If so, what were the results? Have you been given isoniazid prophylaxis for TB infection? Have you been treated for TB in the past?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have pain? Where is the pain? What is the nature of the pain? Do you have a sore throat, headache, myalgias, or arthralgias? Is there pain on urination or other activity?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have any swelling? Is there drainage associated with the swelling? Is the swollen area warm to the touch?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have a draining lesion? Is the drainage associated with trauma or a previous procedure? Is the drainage pus or clear? Does the drainage have an odor?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you have a rash? What is the nature of the rash&#x2014;is it flat, raised, red, crusted, weeping, or lacelike? Have you taken medications that could have induced the rash? Have you been exposed to another person with an identified infectious disease or rash?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What is your vaccination history? Are your immunizations up-to-date?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have you had an insect or animal bite? Have you had an animal scratch or other exposure to pets, farm animals, or experimental animals?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What medications do you use? Have you taken antibiotic agents recently or long term? Are you being treated with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, or chemotherapy?</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3136">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of infectious diseases vary significantly for different diseases and different people. For some infections, visible symptoms such as rash, redness, or swelling provide early warnings of infection. In other infections, such as TB and HIV, asymptomatic latency is prolonged, and infection must be determined through diagnostic procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">A careful history along with a review of the patient&#x2019;s medical record will determine current symptoms and underlying conditions. <a href="#ct66-5">Chart&#x00A0;66-5</a> outlines questions the nurse should ask when obtaining a health history.</p>
<p class="indent">Physical examination may reveal signs of infection. Generalized signs of chronic infection may include significant weight loss or pallor associated with anemia of chronic diseases. Acute infection may manifest with fever, chills, lymphadenopathy, or rash. Localized signs vary by source of infection. Purulent drainage, pain, edema, and redness are strongly associated with localized infection. Cough and shortness of breath may be caused by influenza, pneumonia, or TB, as well as many noninfectious causes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="h7a">Preventing Infection Transmission</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preventing the spread of infection requires an understanding of the usual routes of transmission of the organism. The patient in a health care facility may pose a contagious risk to others if the disease is easily spread (such as <em>C. difficile</em>) or is spread through an airborne route (such as TB). In these situations, strict adherence to isolation measures is important to reduce the opportunity for spread. Preventing transmission of organisms from patient to patient requires participation of all members of the health care team. Recent research also highlights the importance of the inpatient environment for potential reservoirs for organisms that cause HAIs (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4589">Cohen, Spirito, Liu, et al., 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct66-6">Chart&#x00A0;66-6</a>.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>It is imperative that nurses disinfect their hands before and after contact with patients in any setting and after performing a potentially hand-contaminating activity. Hands must be disinfected each time gloves are removed.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating About the Infectious Process</p>
<p class="nonindent">The first step in preventing the spread of infections is diagnosis. The nurse can educate the patient to understand the diagnosis and to adhere to the treatment regimen. Infectious diseases often seem mysterious and are frequently socially stigmatizing. Patient education requires empathy and sensitivity. Some infections must be reported to public health officials for contact tracing and complete follow-up. Nurses are key to educating patients about guidelines for preventing transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in the community (see later discussion in this chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must stress the importance of immunization to parents of young children and to others for whom vaccines are recommended, such as older adults or those who are immunosuppressed or have chronic illness or disability. Nurses should recognize their personal responsibility to receive the hepatitis B vaccine and an annual influenza vaccine to reduce potential transmission to themselves and vulnerable patient groups. Most recently, the nurse has a professional responsibility to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2160" title="2160"></span>vaccinated for COVID-19 and to advocate for all professional and personal contacts to receive the vaccine at the first available opportunity.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Environmental Concerns for Possible Inpatient Transmission of Bacterial Pathogens</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Cohen, B., Spirito, C. M., Liu, J., et al. (2019). Concurrent detection of bacterial pathogens in hospital roommates. <em>Nursing Research, 68</em>(1), 80&#x2013;83.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The inpatient environment is a potential reservoir for organisms. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of concurrent detection of bacterial pathogens among hospital roommates.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study was a retrospective analysis using administrative and clinical data collected from four inpatient facilities in New York City between 2006 and 2012. A computerized algorithm identified the presence of concurrent organisms among roommates, defined as two patients sharing a room for at least 1 day and having a first positive culture for that organism within 3 days following cohabitation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A total of 741,271 patient admissions were included in the analysis. The algorithm identified 373 valid concurrent detection events among roommates. Among these events, 158 (42%) were pairs in which the patients&#x2019; first positive cultures were drawn after they were no longer sharing a room but within 3 days of cohabitation. In 144 pairs (39%), the first positive cultures were drawn while the patients were still sharing a room but on different days. In the remaining 71 pairs (19%), the patients&#x2019; positive cultures were drawn while they were sharing a room on the same day.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study illustrates the important role nurses play in planning and implementing interventions to reduce bioburden in the inpatient environment, particularly in patient rooms. Nurses need to pay attention to the methods used for environmental decontamination as part of a comprehensive approach to infection prevention in hospitals. In particular, nurses may be able to improve environmental decontamination by identifying frequently missed surfaces or equipment that require attention from environmental services teams.</p>
</div>
<p class="h7">Controlling Fever and Accompanying Discomforts</p>
<p class="nonindent">Fever must always be investigated to determine the source. Fever may potentiate beneficial functions in the syndrome of reactions known as <em>acute-phase reaction.</em> These reactions include changes in liver protein synthesis; alterations in serum metals, such as iron; and increased production of certain classes of white blood cells and other cells of the immune system (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Norris, 2019</a>). Most fevers are physiologically controlled so that the temperature remains below 41&#x00B0;C (105.8&#x00B0;F). However, severe fever may cause complications. Even mild fevers accompanied by fatigue, chills, and diaphoresis are often uncomfortable for the patient. Whether fever is treated or untreated, adequate fluid intake is important during febrile episodes. See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for management of fever in the patient with COVID-19.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Because fever is a key symptom, outpatients with fever should be instructed to obtain accurate temperature readings. Frequently, family caregivers know that a patient has warm skin but do not take a temperature reading. Body temperature information can be very helpful in adjusting therapy or in reevaluating a preliminary diagnosis.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a rapidly progressive infectious disease should have vital signs and level of consciousness closely monitored. Results from radiologic and laboratory diagnostics (microbiologic, parasitologic, immunologic, hematologic, cytologic, etc.) must be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings to assess the course of the infectious disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotic therapy is frequently complex, and modifications are necessary because of drug susceptibility test results and disease progression. To rapidly ensure therapeutic blood levels, antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as it is prescribed rather than waiting until routine medication scheduling times. <a href="c66-sec04.xhtml#ct66-7">Chart&#x00A0;66-7</a> describes nursing interventions for infection.</p>
