<h4 class="h4" id="s59">Physical Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Physical assessment, or the physical examination (collection of objective data about the patient&#x2019;s health status), is an integral part of nursing assessment. The basic techniques and tools used in performing a physical examination are described in general in this chapter. The examinations of specific systems, including special maneuvers, are described in the respective system assessment chapters throughout the book.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s60">Examination Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The physical examination is usually performed after the health history is obtained. It is carried out in a well-lighted, warm area. The patient is asked to (or helped to) undress and is draped appropriately so that only the area to be examined is exposed. The patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological comfort are considered at all times. It is necessary to describe procedures to the patient and explain what sensations to expect before each part of the examination. The examiner washes his or her hands before and immediately after the examination. Fingernails are kept short to avoid injuring the patient. If there is a possibility of coming into contact with blood or other body secretions during the physical examination, gloves should be worn.</p>
<p class="indent">An organized and systematic examination is the key to obtaining appropriate data in the shortest time. Such an approach encourages cooperation and trust on the part of the patient. The patient&#x2019;s health history provides the examiner with a health profile that guides all aspects of the physical examination.</p>
<p class="indent">A &#x201C;complete&#x201D; physical examination is not routine. Many of the body systems are selectively assessed on the basis of the presenting problem. For example, if a healthy 20-year-old college student requires an examination to study abroad and reports no history of neurologic abnormality, the neurologic assessment is brief. Conversely, a history of transient numbness and diplopia (double vision) usually necessitates a complete neurologic investigation. Similarly, a patient with chest pain receives a much more intensive examination of the chest and the heart than one with an earache. In general, the health history guides the examiner in obtaining additional data for a complete picture of the patient&#x2019;s health.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of learning to perform a physical examination requires repetition and reinforcement in a simulated or clinical setting. Only after basic physical assessment techniques are mastered can the examiner tailor the routine examination to include thorough assessments of particular systems, including special maneuvers (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s61">Components of the Physical Examination</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The components of a physical examination include general observations and then a more focused assessment of the pertinent body systems. The tools of the physical examination are the human senses of vision, hearing, touch, and smell. These may be augmented by special tools (e.g., stethoscope, ophthalmoscope, reflex hammer) that are extensions of the human senses; they are simple tools that anyone can learn to use well. Expertise comes with practice, and sophistication comes with the interpretation of what is seen and heard.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Initial Observations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">General inspection begins with the first contact with the patient. Introducing oneself and shaking hands provide opportunities for making initial observations: Is the person old or young? How old? How young? Does the person appear to be their stated age? Is the person thin or obese? Does the person appear anxious or depressed? Is the person&#x2019;s body structure normal or abnormal&#x2014;in what way and how different from normal? It is essential to pay attention to the details in observation. Vague, general statements are not a substitute for specific descriptions based on careful observation. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>&#x201C;The patient appears sick.&#x201D; In what way do they appear sick? Is the skin clammy, pale, jaundiced, or cyanotic? Is the patient grimacing in pain or having difficulty breathing? Do they have edema? What specific physical features or behavioral manifestations indicate that the patient is &#x201C;sick?&#x201D;</span></li>
<li><span>&#x201C;The patient appears chronically ill.&#x201D; In what way do they appear chronically ill? Does the patient appear to have lost weight? Patients who lose weight secondary to muscle-wasting diseases (e.g., AIDS, malignancy) have a different appearance than those who are merely thin, and weight loss may be accompanied by loss of muscle mass or atrophy. Does the skin have the appearance of chronic illness (i.e., is it pale, or does it give the appearance of dehydration or loss of subcutaneous tissue)?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">These important specific observations are documented in the patient&#x2019;s chart or health record. Among general observations that should be noted in the initial examination of the patient are posture, body movements, nutritional status, speech pattern, and vital signs.</p>
<p class="h7">Posture</p>
<p class="nonindent">The posture that a patient assumes often provides valuable information. Patients who have dyspnea (breathing difficulties) secondary to cardiac disease prefer to sit and may report feeling short of breath when lying flat for even a brief time. Patients with abdominal pain owing to peritonitis prefer to lie perfectly still; even slight jarring of the bed or examination table causes agonizing pain. In contrast, patients with abdominal pain owing to renal or biliary colic are often restless and may pace the room.</p>
<p class="h7">Body Movements</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are two kinds of abnormalities of body movement: generalized disruption of voluntary or involuntary movement and asymmetry of movement. The first category includes various tremors; some tremors may occur at rest (Parkinson&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" title="84"></span>disease), whereas others occur only on voluntary movement (cerebellar ataxia). Other tremors may exist during both rest and activity (alcohol withdrawal syndrome, thyrotoxicosis). Some voluntary or involuntary movements are fine and others are quite coarse. Extreme examples include the convulsive movements of generalized seizures and the choreiform (involuntary and irregular) movements of patients with rheumatic fever or Huntington disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Asymmetry of movement, in which only one side of the body is affected, may occur with disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), primarily in those patients who have had a stroke. Patients may have drooping of one side of the face, weakness or paralysis of the extremities on one side of the body, or a foot-dragging gait.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Nutritional Status</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nutritional status is important to note. Obesity may be generalized as a result of excessive intake of calories, or it may be specifically localized to the trunk in patients who have an endocrine disorder (Cushing&#x2019;s disease) or who have been taking corticosteroids for long periods. Loss of weight may be generalized as a result of inadequate caloric intake, or it may be seen in loss of muscle mass with disorders that affect protein synthesis. Nutritional assessment is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="h7">Speech Pattern</p>
<p class="nonindent">Speech may be slurred because of CNS disease or because of damage to cranial nerves. Recurrent damage to the laryngeal nerve results in hoarseness, as do disorders that produce edema or swelling of the vocal cords. Speech may be halting, slurred, or interrupted in flow in patients with some CNS disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke).</p>

<p class="nonindent">The recording of vital signs is a part of every physical examination (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>). Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature measurements are obtained and recorded. Acute changes and trends over time are documented, and unexpected changes and values that deviate significantly from a patient&#x2019;s normal values are brought to the attention of the patient&#x2019;s primary provider. Pain is also assessed and documented, if indicated (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Focused Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Following the general inspection, a more focused assessment is conducted. Although the sequence of physical examination depends on the circumstances and the patient&#x2019;s reason for seeking health care, the complete examination usually proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Skin</span></li>
<li><span>Head and neck</span></li>
<li><span>Thorax and lungs</span></li>
<li><span>Breasts</span></li>
<li><span>Cardiovascular system</span></li>
<li><span>Abdomen</span></li>
<li><span>Rectum</span></li>
<li><span>Genitalia</span></li>
<li><span>Neurologic system</span></li>
<li><span>Musculoskeletal system</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">In clinical practice, all relevant body systems are tested throughout the physical examination, not necessarily in the sequence described (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). For example, when the face is examined, it is appropriate to check for facial asymmetry and, thus, for the integrity of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves; the examiner does not need to repeat this as part of a neurologic examination. When systems are combined in this manner, the patient does not need to change positions repeatedly, which can be exhausting and time-consuming.</p>
<p class="indent">The traditional sequence in the focused portion of the examination is inspection, palpation, percussion, and then auscultation, except in the case of an abdominal examination (in which auscultation precedes palpation and percussion).</p>
<p class="h7">Inspection</p>
<p class="nonindent">The first fundamental technique is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;inspection:&lt;/b&gt; visual assessment of different aspects of the patient (e.g., visual assessment of the patient&#x2019;s body systems and body movements)">inspection</button></strong>, or observation of each relevant body system in more detail as indicated from the health history or the general inspection. Characteristics such as skin color, presence and size of lesions, edema, erythema, symmetry, and pulsations are noted. Specific body movements that are noted on inspection include spasticity, muscle spasms, and an abnormal gait (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;palpation:&lt;/b&gt; examination of different organs of the body using the sense of touch">Palpation</button></strong>, which utilizes the sense of touch, is a vital part of the physical examination. Many structures of the body, although not visible, may be assessed through the techniques of light and deep palpation (<a href="#ff4-3">Fig.&#x00A0;4-3</a>). Examples include the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page85" title="85"></span>superficial blood vessels, lymph nodes, thyroid gland, organs of the abdomen and the pelvis, and rectum. When the abdomen is examined, auscultation is performed before palpation and percussion to avoid altering bowel sounds (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff4-3">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff4-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff4-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;4-3 &#x2022;</span> <strong>A.</strong> Light palpation. <strong>B.</strong> Deep palpation.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Some sounds generated within the body, if within specified frequency ranges, may also be detected through touch. For example, turbulent flow in the heart or within blood vessels (thrills) may be detected. Thrills cause a sensation to the hand much like the purring of a cat. Voice sounds are transmitted along the bronchi to the periphery of the lung. These may be perceived by touch and may be altered by disorders affecting the lungs. The phenomenon is called <em>tactile fremitus</em> and is useful in assessing diseases of the chest. The significance of these findings is discussed in <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;17</a> and <a href="c21.xhtml">21</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Percussion</p>
<p class="nonindent">The technique of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;percussion:&lt;/b&gt; the use of sound to examine different organs of the body">percussion</button></strong> translates the application of physical force into sound. It is a skill requiring practice that yields much information about disease processes in the chest and the abdomen (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The principle is to set the chest wall or abdominal wall into vibration by striking it with a firm object. The sound produced reflects the density of the underlying structure. Certain densities produce sounds as percussion notes. These sounds, listed in a sequence that proceeds from the least to the densest, are tympany, hyperresonance, resonance, dullness, and flatness. Tympany is the drumlike sound produced by percussing the air-filled stomach. Hyperresonance is audible when one percusses over inflated lung tissue in a person with emphysema. Resonance is the sound elicited over air-filled lungs. Percussion of the liver produces a dull sound, whereas percussion of the thigh produces a flat sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Percussion allows the examiner to assess such normal anatomic details as the borders of the heart and the movement of the diaphragm during inspiration. It is also possible to determine the level of a pleural effusion (fluid in the pleural cavity) and the location of a consolidated area caused by pneumonia or atelectasis (collapse of alveoli). The use of percussion is described further with disorders of the thorax and the abdomen (see <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;17</a> and <a href="c38.xhtml">38</a>).</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">Whereas auscultation involves listening to sounds produced within the body by the movement of air, percussion involves applying physical force to the body in order to discern what sounds are made, thereby assessing internal organs. Hyperresonance is audible when one percusses over inflated lung tissue in a person with emphysema.</p>
</div>
<p class="h7">Auscultation</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;auscultation:&lt;/b&gt; listening to sounds produced within different body structures created by the movement of air or fluid">Auscultation</button></strong> is the skill of listening to sounds produced within the body created by the movement of air or fluid (<a href="#ff4-4">Fig.&#x00A0;4-4</a>). A stethoscope is typically used to enhance this technique. Examples include breath sounds, the spoken voice, bowel sounds, heart sounds, and cardiac murmurs. Physiologic sounds may be normal (e.g., first and second heart sounds) or pathologic (e.g., heart murmurs in diastole, crackles in the lung). Some normal sounds may be distorted by abnormalities of structures through which the sound must travel (e.g., changes in the character of breath sounds as they travel through the consolidated lung of a patient with lobar pneumonia).</p>

<p class="indent">Sound produced within the body, if of sufficient amplitude, may be detected with the stethoscope, which functions as an extension of the human ear and channels sound. The nurse must avoid touching the tubing or rubbing other surfaces (hair, clothing) during auscultation to minimize extraneous noises. Sounds detected by auscultation are classified according to their intensity (loud or soft), pitch (high or low), duration (length), and quality (musical, raspy, crackling) (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
