<h4 class="h4" id="s193">FLUID VOLUME DISTURBANCES</h4>
<h4 class="h4a" id="s194"><strong>Hypovolemia</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">FVD, or hypovolemia, occurs when loss of ECF volume exceeds the intake of fluid. It occurs when water and electrolytes are lost in the same proportion as they exist in normal body fluids; thus, the ratio of serum electrolytes to water remains the same. FVD should not be confused with dehydration, which refers to loss of water alone, with increased serum sodium levels. FVD may occur alone or in combination with other imbalances. Serum electrolyte concentrations can remain normal, increase, or increase in FVD (Sterns, 2017a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s195">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">FVD results from loss of body fluids and occurs more rapidly when coupled with decreased fluid intake. FVD can also develop with a prolonged period of inadequate intake. Causes of FVD include abnormal fluid losses, such as those resulting from vomiting, diarrhea, GI suctioning, and sweating; decreased intake, as in nausea or lack of access to fluids; and third-space fluid shifts, or the movement of fluid from the vascular system to other body spaces (e.g., with edema formation in burns, ascites with liver dysfunction). Additional causes include diabetes insipidus (a decreased ability to concentrate urine due to either a deficit of ADH or nephron resistance to ADH), adrenal insufficiency, osmotic diuresis, hemorrhage, and coma (Sterns, 2017a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s196">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">FVD can develop rapidly, and its severity depends on the degree of fluid loss. Clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings are presented in <a href="#tt10-4">Table&#x00A0;10-4</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s197">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Laboratory data used to evaluate fluid volume status include BUN and its relation to serum creatinine concentration. Normal BUN to serum creatinine concentration ratio is 10:1. A volume-depleted patient has a BUN elevated out of proportion to the serum creatinine (ratio greater than 20:1) because urea becomes concentrated in FVD (Sterns, 2017a).</p>
<p class="indent">The presence and cause of hypovolemia may be determined through the health history and physical examination. In addition, the hematocrit level is greater than normal because there is a decreased plasma volume, which concentrates the volume of RBCs.</p>
<p class="indent">Serum electrolyte changes may also exist. Potassium and sodium levels can be reduced (hypokalemia, hyponatremia) or elevated (hyperkalemia, hypernatremia).</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Hypokalemia can occur with GI and renal losses as these organs are major regulators of potassium.</span></li>
<li><span>Hyperkalemia can occur with adrenal insufficiency due to aldosterone deficiency which causes lack of potassium excretion.</span></li>
<li><span>Hyponatremia can occur with increased thirst and ADH release, which increases water content of the bloodstream.</span></li>
<li><span>Hypernatremia can result from increased insensible water losses and diabetes insipidus.</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">Oliguria, the excretion of less than 400 mL urine per day in the adult, may or may not be present in hypovolemia. Urine specific gravity will change in relation to the kidneys&#x2019; attempt to conserve water. If the kidney does not reabsorb water, urine contains more water, and urine specific gravity is low. If the kidney does reabsorb water, urine will be concentrated and specific gravity increases. Due to lack of ADH in diabetes insipidus, urine water content increases, which decreases urine specific gravity. Aldosterone is secreted when fluid volume is low, causing reabsorption of sodium and chloride and resulting in decreased urinary sodium and chloride. When the kidneys conserve water, urine osmolality can increase to greater than 450 mOsm/kg and urine specific gravity increases (Sterns, 2017a). Normal values for laboratory data are listed in Appendix A on <img src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s198"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Increased sensitivity to fluid and electrolyte changes in older patients requires careful physical assessment, measurement of I&#x0026;O of fluids from all sources, assessment of daily weight, careful monitoring of side effects and interactions of medications, and prompt reporting and management of disturbances. In most adult patients, it is useful to monitor skin turgor to detect subtle changes. However, assessment of skin turgor is not as valid in older adults because the skin has lost elasticity; therefore, other assessment measures (e.g., slowness in filling of veins of the hands and feet) become more useful in detecting FVD (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse also performs a functional assessment of the older patient&#x2019;s ability to determine fluid and food needs and to obtain adequate intake in addition to assessments discussed earlier in this chapter. For example, the nurse assesses whether or not the patient is cognitively intact, able to ambulate and to use both arms and hands to reach fluids and foods, and able to swallow with an intact gag reflex. Results of this functional assessment have a direct bearing on how the patient will be able to meet their own need for fluids and foods (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). During an older patient&#x2019;s hospital stay, the nurse provides fluids if the patient is unable to carry out self-care activities.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should also recognize that some older patients deliberately restrict their fluid intake to avoid episodes of urinary incontinence. In this situation, the nurse should identify interventions to deal with the incontinence, such as encouraging the patient to wear protective clothing or devices, to carry a urinal in the car, or to pace fluid intake to allow access to toilet facilities during the day. Older adults without cardiovascular or renal dysfunction should be reminded to drink adequate fluids, particularly in very warm or humid weather (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s199">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When planning the correction of fluid loss for the patient with FVD, the primary provider considers the patient&#x2019;s maintenance requirements and other factors (e.g., fever) that can influence fluid needs. If the deficit is not severe, the oral route is preferred, provided the patient can drink. However, if fluid losses are acute or severe, the IV route is required. Isotonic electrolyte crystalloid solutions (e.g., lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution or 0.9% sodium chloride) are frequently the first-line choice to treat the hypotensive patient with FVD because they expand plasma volume. As soon as the patient becomes normotensive, a hypotonic electrolyte solution (e.g., 0.45% sodium chloride) is often used to provide both electrolytes and water for renal excretion of metabolic wastes (Sterns, 2017a; Sterns, 2017b). These and additional fluids are listed in <a href="#tt10-5">Table&#x00A0;10-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Accurate and frequent assessments of I&#x0026;O, weight, vital signs, central venous pressure, level of consciousness, breath sounds, and skin color are monitored to determine when therapy should be slowed to avoid volume overload. The rate of fluid administration is based on the severity of loss and the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic response to volume replacement (Sterns, 2017a; Sterns, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient with severe FVD is not excreting enough urine and is therefore oliguric, the primary provider needs to determine whether the depressed renal function is caused by reduced renal blood flow secondary to FVD (prerenal azotemia) or, more seriously, by acute tubular necrosis (intrarenal azotemia) from prolonged FVD (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). The test used in this situation is referred to as a fluid challenge test. During a fluid challenge test, volumes of fluid are given at specific rates and intervals while the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic response to this treatment is monitored (i.e., vital signs, breath sounds, orientation status, central venous pressure, urine output) (Sterns, 2017b).</p>

<p class="indent">An example of a typical fluid challenge test involves administering 100 to 200 mL of normal saline solution over 15 minutes. The goal is to provide fluids rapidly enough to attain adequate tissue perfusion without compromising the cardiovascular system. The response by a patient with FVD but normal renal function is increased urine output and an increase in blood pressure and central venous pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Shock can occur when the volume of fluid lost exceeds 25% of the intravascular volume or when fluid loss is rapid (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Mandel &#x0026; Palevsky, 2019</a>). (Shock and its causes and treatment are discussed in detail in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s200">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">To assess for FVD, the nurse monitors and measures fluid I&#x0026;O at least every 8 hours, and sometimes hourly. Maintaining an accurate I&#x0026;O is a particular challenge with patients in critical-care settings. As FVD develops, body fluid losses exceed fluid intake through excessive urination (polyuria), diarrhea, vomiting, or other mechanisms. Once FVD has developed, the kidneys attempt to conserve body fluids, leading to a urine output of less than 1 mL/kg/h in an adult. Urine in this instance is concentrated and represents a healthy renal response.</p>
<p class="indent">Vital signs should be closely monitored in FVD.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse observes for a weak, rapid pulse and orthostatic hypotension (i.e., a decrease in systolic pressure exceeding 20 mm Hg when the patient moves from a lying to a sitting position).</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">A decrease in body temperature often accompanies FVD, unless there is a concurrent infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Skin and tongue turgor are monitored on a regular basis. In a healthy person, pinched skin immediately returns to its normal position when released (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). This elastic property, referred to as turgor, is partially dependent on interstitial fluid volume. In a person with FVD, the skin flattens more slowly after the pinch is released. In a person with severe FVD, the skin may remain elevated for many seconds. Tissue turgor is best measured by pinching the skin over the sternum, dorsal surface of the hand, inner aspects of the thighs, or forehead. It is important to recognize skin turgor is normally diminished in old age. Tongue turgor is not affected by age, and evaluating this may be more valid than evaluating skin turgor (Sterns, 2017a). In a normal person, the tongue has one longitudinal furrow. In the person with FVD, there are additional longitudinal furrows and the tongue is smaller because of fluid loss. The degree of oral mucous membrane moisture is also assessed; a dry mouth may indicate either FVD or mouth breathing.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>It is useful to monitor daily body weight when monitoring fluid volume; an acute loss of 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) represents a fluid loss of approximately 500 mL. One liter (1000 mL) of fluid weighs approximately 1 kg, or 2.2 lb. A weight loss or gain of 1&#x2013;2 lb/day is mainly due to water loss or gain.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Urine concentration is monitored by measuring the urine specific gravity. In a volume-depleted patient, the urine specific gravity should be greater than 1.020, indicating healthy renal conservation of fluid. Dark amber-colored urine is highly concentrated; whereas, clear yellow urine indicates a dilute urine.</p>
<p class="indent">Mental function is eventually affected, resulting in confusion, lack of cognition, and delirium in severe FVD as a result of decreasing cerebral perfusion. Behavioral changes are particularly evident in older adults with FVD. Decreased peripheral perfusion can result in cold extremities. In patients with relatively normal cardiopulmonary function, a low central venous pressure is indicative of hypovolemia (Sterns, 2017a). Patients with acute cardiopulmonary decompensation require more extensive hemodynamic monitoring of pressures in both sides of the heart to determine whether hypovolemia exists. Hemodynamic monitoring is particularly important in critically ill patients (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Mandel &#x0026; Palevsky, 2019</a>) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;11</a> and <a href="c21.xhtml">21</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Hypovolemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To prevent FVD, the nurse identifies patients at risk and takes measures to minimize fluid losses. For example, if the patient has diarrhea, measures should be implemented to control diarrhea and replacement fluids given. This includes administering antidiarrheal medications and small volumes of oral fluids at frequent intervals.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Correcting Hypovolemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When possible, oral fluids are given to help correct FVD, with consideration given to the patient&#x2019;s likes and dislikes. The type of fluid the patient has lost is also considered, and fluids most likely to replace the lost electrolytes are appropriate. If the patient is reluctant to drink because of oral discomfort, the nurse assists with frequent mouth care and provides nonirritating fluids. The patient may be offered small volumes of oral rehydration solutions (e.g., Rehydralyte, Elete, and Cytomax). These solutions provide fluid, glucose, and electrolytes in concentrations that are easily absorbed. If nausea is present, an antiemetic may be needed before oral fluid replacement can be tolerated (Sterns, 2017a; Sterns, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent">If the deficit cannot be corrected by oral fluids, therapy may need to be initiated by an alternative route (enteral or parenteral) until adequate circulating blood volume and renal perfusion are achieved. Isotonic fluids are prescribed to increase ECF volume (Sterns, 2017b).</p>
