<div class="objectives">
<p class="objectivespTOPICpPARA"><em>On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:</em></p>
<ol class="obj"><li><span>Describe the significance of the principles of internal constancy, homeostasis, stress, and adaptation in promoting and maintaining steady state in the body.</span></li>
<li><span>Describe the General Adaptation Syndrome and the sympathetic&#x2013;adrenal&#x2013;medullary and hypothalamic-pituitary responses to stress.</span></li>
<li><span>Identify ways in which maladaptive responses to stress can increase the risk of illness and cause disease.</span></li>
<li><span>Compare the adaptive processes of atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia within the body&#x2019;s inflammatory and reparative processes.</span></li>
<li><span>Assess the health patterns of individuals and families, identifying strategies that are useful in reducing stress.</span></li></ol>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH):</span> a hormone produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland that stimulates the secretion of cortisol and other hormones by the adrenal cortex</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">antidiuretic hormone (ADH):</span> a hormone secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland that constricts blood vessels, elevates blood pressure, and reduces the excretion of urine</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">catecholamines:</span> any of the group of amines (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine) that serve as neurotransmitters</p>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">corticosteroids:</span> the group of steroid hormones, such as cortisol, that are produced by the adrenal cortex; they are involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and have anti-inflammatory properties</p>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypoxia:</span> inadequate supply of oxygen to the cell</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">inflammation:</span> a localized reaction of tissue to injury, irritation, or infection that is manifested by five cardinal signs of redness, warmth, swelling, pain, and loss of function</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">metaplasia:</span> a cell transformation in which one type of mature cell is converted into another type of cell</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">negative feedback:</span> mechanisms that monitor the internal environment and restore homeostasis when conditions shift out of the normal range</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">positive feedback:</span> mechanisms that perpetuate a chain of events</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">steady state:</span> a stable condition that does not change over time, or when change in one direction is balanced by change in an opposite direction</p>

<p class="nonindent">When the body is threatened or suffers an injury, its response may involve functional and structural changes; these changes may be adaptive (having a positive effect) or maladaptive (having a negative effect). The defense mechanisms that the body uses determine the difference between adaptation and maladaptation&#x2014;health and disease. This chapter addresses individual homeostasis, stress, adaptation, health problems associated with maladaptation, and ways that nurses intervene with patients and families to reduce stress and its health-related effects.</p>
