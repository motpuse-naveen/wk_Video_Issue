<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pressure injury:&lt;/b&gt; localized area of skin breakdown and/or underlying soft tissue damage due to prolonged pressure and insufficient blood supply; formerly known as &lt;em&gt;pressure ulcer&lt;/em&gt;">Pressure injury</button></strong>, formerly called pressure ulcer, is a localized area of necrotic soft tissue that occurs when pressure applied to the skin is greater than the normal capillary closure pressure (approximately 32 mm Hg) over a period of time sufficient to cause tissue injury. Patients who are critically ill have a lower capillary closure pressure and a greater risk of pressure injuries, as are patients who are exposed to prolonged pressure due to immobility, have motor or sensory dysfunction, or have muscular atrophy that reduces padding between the overlying skin and the underlying bone.</p>
<p class="indent">A landmark 10-year pressure injury prevalence survey conducted among 918,621 inpatients in the United States from 2006 through 2015 showed an overall decrease in prevalence of pressure injury from 13.5% in 2006 to 9.3% in 2015 (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4092">VanGilder, Lachenbruch, Algrim-Boyle, et al., 2017</a>). Despite declining prevalence, pressure injuries nonetheless result in significant pain and suffering, increased morbidity and mortality, higher medical costs and resource use, and lower odds of discharge to the community (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">VanGilder et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The American Nurses Association tracks hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) quarterly as part of the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (NDNQI<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>). In the United States, an estimate of 2.5 million patients in acute care facilities develop HAPIs annually, with approximately 60,000 patient deaths associated with complications from HAPIs. The cost of treatment for a single, full-thickness pressure injury may be as high as $70,000 with an estimated annual total cost of $11 billion for pressure injury treatment in the United States (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4005">Agency for Healthcare Research &#x0026; Quality [AHRQ], 2014</a>). All possible efforts to prevent skin breakdown must be made because the treatment of pressure injuries is costly in terms of health care dollars and quality of life for patients at risk.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial sign of pressure is erythema (redness of the skin) caused by reactive hyperemia, which normally resolves in less than 1 hour. Unrelieved pressure results in tissue ischemia or anoxia. The cutaneous tissues become broken or destroyed, leading to progressive destruction and necrosis of underlying soft tissue, and the resulting pressure injury is painful and slow to heal.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Pressure injuries are associated with increased costs of treatment and length of hospital stay as well as diminished quality of life for patients. It is imperative that nurses perform a skin assessment on every patient admitted to a hospital, inpatient rehabilitation facility, or skilled nursing facility.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Immobility.</span> When a person is immobile and inactive, pressure is exerted on the skin and subcutaneous tissue by objects on which the person rests, such as a mattress, chair seat, or cast. The development of pressure injuries is directly related to the duration of immobility. If pressure continues long enough, small-vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis occur and a pressure injury is the result. Weight-bearing bony prominences are most susceptible to pressure injury development because they are covered only by skin and small amounts of subcutaneous tissue. Susceptible areas include the sacrum and coccygeal areas, ischial tuberosities (especially in people who sit for prolonged periods), greater trochanter, heel, knee, malleolus, medial condyle of the tibia, fibular head, scapula, and elbow, with the sacrum and heels the most common sites (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>) (<a href="#ff56-1">Fig. 56-1</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Impaired Sensory Perception or Cognition.</span> Patients with sensory loss, impaired level of consciousness, or paralysis may not be aware of the discomfort associated with prolonged pressure on the skin and therefore may not change their positions to relieve the pressure. This prolonged pressure impedes blood flow, reducing nourishment of the skin and underlying tissues. A pressure injury may develop in a short period of time, sometimes within minutes.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Decreased Tissue Perfusion.</span> Any condition that reduces the circulation and nourishment of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (altered peripheral tissue perfusion) increases the risk of pressure injury development. Patients with diabetes have compromised microcirculation. Similarly, patients with edema have impaired circulation and poor nourishment of the skin tissue. Patients with obesity have large amounts of poorly vascularized adipose tissue, which is susceptible to breakdown.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Nutritional Status.</span> Nutritional deficiencies, anemias, and metabolic disorders also contribute to the development of pressure injuries. Anemia, regardless of its cause, decreases the blood&#x2019;s oxygen-carrying ability and predisposes the patient to pressure injuries. Maintaining good nutrition and preventing malnutrition are essential to prevent pressure injuries and promote wound healing (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>). Serum albumin and prealbumin levels are sensitive indicators of protein deficiency. Serum albumin levels of less than 3 g/dL are associated with hypoalbuminemic tissue edema and increased risk of pressure injuries. Prealbumin levels are more sensitive indicators of protein status than the albumin levels, but they are costlier to assess. The nurse should assess the patient&#x2019;s prealbumin and albumin values and electrolyte panel (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Friction and Shear.</span> Mechanical forces also contribute to the development of pressure injuries. Friction is the force of rubbing two surfaces against each another and is often caused by pulling a patient over a bed sheet or from a poorly fitted prosthetic device. Shear is the result of exerting a parallel force on the patient&#x2019;s body, such as the resistance between the patient and the chair or bed when the patient slides down (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4035">Edsberg, Black, Goldberg, et al., 2016</a>). When shear occurs, tissue layers slide over one another, blood vessels stretch and twist, and the microcirculation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue is disrupted. Evidence of deep tissue damage may be slow to develop and may present through the development of a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sinus tract:&lt;/b&gt; course or path of tissue destruction occurring in any direction from the surface or edge of a wound (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: tunneling)">sinus tract</button></strong> (also called tunneling), which is an area of destroyed tissue that extends from the edge of a wound; this results in dead space that is susceptible to abscess formation. The sacrum and heels are most susceptible to the effects of shear. Pressure injuries from friction and shear occur when the patient slides down in bed (<a href="#ff56-2">Fig. 56-2</a>) or when the patient is positioned or moved improperly (e.g., dragged up in bed). Spastic muscles and paralysis increase the patient&#x2019;s vulnerability to pressure injuries related to friction and shear.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Increased Moisture.</span> Prolonged contact with moisture from perspiration, urine, feces, or drainage produces maceration (softening) of the skin. The skin reacts to caustic substances in the excreta or drainage and becomes irritated. Moist, irritated skin is more vulnerable to pressure breakdown. Once the skin breaks, the area is invaded by microorganisms (e.g., streptococci, staphylococci, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli</em>), and infection occurs. Foul-smelling infectious drainage is present. The lesion may enlarge and allow a continuous loss of serum, which may further deplete the body of essential protein needed for tissue repair and maintenance. The lesion may continue to enlarge and extend deep into the fascia, muscle, and bone, with multiple sinus tracts radiating from the pressure injury. With extensive pressure injuries, life-threatening infections and sepsis may develop, frequently from gram-negative organisms.</p>

The skin is drier as a result of diminished sebaceous and sweat gland activities. Cardiovascular changes result in decreased tissue perfusion. Muscles atrophy and bone structures become prominent. Diminished sensory perception and reduced ability to reposition oneself contribute to prolonged pressure on the skin. Therefore, older adults are more susceptible to pressure injuries, which cause pain, suffering, and reduced quality of life (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: Persistent Non-Blanchable Deep Red, Maroon or Purple Discoloration</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4). Do not use DTPI to describe vascular, traumatic, neuropathic, or dermatologic conditions.</p>

Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).</p>

<p class="processppara">The major goals may include relief of pressure, improved mobility, maintenance of skin integrity, improved sensory perception, improved tissue perfusion, improved nutritional status, minimized friction and shear forces, dry surfaces in contact with skin, and healing of pressure injury, if present.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">ELIEVING</span> P<span class="small">RESSURE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Frequent changes of position are needed to relieve and redistribute the pressure on the patient&#x2019;s skin and to promote blood flow to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This can be accomplished by instructing the patient to change position or by turning and repositioning the patient. The patient&#x2019;s family members should be educated about how to position and turn the patient at home to prevent pressure injuries. Shifting weight allows the blood to flow into the ischemic areas and helps tissues recover from the effects of pressure. Elevating the head of bed no more than 30 degrees will prevent the patient from sliding down in bed and avoid the effects of shearing (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For patients who spend long periods in a wheelchair, pressure can be relieved by:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Push-ups:</em> The patient pushes down on armrests and raises buttocks off the seat of the chair (<a href="#ff56-3">Fig. 56-3</a>).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>One half push-up:</em> The patient repeats the push-up on the right side and then the left, pushing up on one side by pushing down on the armrest.</p>

These push-ups should become an automatic routine (every 15 minutes) for the person with paraplegia. The person should stay up and out of contact with the seat for several seconds. The wheels are kept in the locked position during the exercise.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Moving side to side:</em> The patient moves from one side to the other while sitting in the chair.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Shifting:</em> The patient bends forward with the head down between the knees (if able) and constantly shifts in the chair.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">OSITIONING THE</span> P<span class="small">ATIENT</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The degree of ability to move independently&#x2014;the comfort, fatigue, loss of sensation, overall physical and mental status, and specific disorder&#x2014;influences plans for changing position. Patients should be positioned laterally, prone, and dorsally in sequence unless a position is not tolerated or is contraindicated. Generally, those who experience discomfort after 30 to 60 minutes of lying prone need to be repositioned. Patients able to shift their weight every 15 to 20 minutes and move independently may change total position every 2 to 4 hours. Indications for routine repositioning every 2 hours or more frequently include loss of sensation, paralysis, coma, and edema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to regular turning, small shifts of body weight, such as repositioning of an ankle, elbow, or shoulder, are necessary. The skin is inspected at each position change and assessed for temperature elevation. If redness or heat is noted or if the patient complains of discomfort, pressure on the area must be relieved.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Another way to relieve pressure over bony prominences is the bridging technique, accomplished through the correct positioning of pillows. Just as a bridge is supported on pillars to allow traffic to move underneath, the body can be supported by pillows to allow for space between bony prominences and the mattress. A pillow or commercial heel protector may be used to support the heels off the bed when the patient is supine. Placing pillows superior and inferior to the sacrum relieves sacral pressure. Supporting the patient in a 30-degree side-lying position avoids pressure on the trochanter; wedges can be used to accomplish this. In older adult patients, frequent small shifts of body weight may be effective. Placing a small rolled towel or sheepskin under a shoulder or hip allows a return of blood flow to the skin in the area on which the patient is sitting or lying. The towel or sheepskin is moved around the patient&#x2019;s pressure points in a clockwise fashion. A turning schedule can help the family keep track of the patient&#x2019;s turns.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>U<span class="small">SING</span> P<span class="small">RESSURE</span>-R<span class="small">ELIEVING</span> D<span class="small">EVICES</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">At times, specialty beds or alternative bed surfaces may be indicated to help relieve the pressure on the skin (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019). These are referred to as pressure redistribution surfaces because they aim to redistribute pressure. Ideally, they should also control moisture and temperature and minimize friction. These devices are designed to provide support for specific body areas or to distribute pressure evenly. Pressure redistribution surfaces may include specialty mattresses as well as mattress overlays. The use of pressure redistribution surfaces is particularly important for patients who cannot get out of bed and who are at high risk for pressure injury development.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A patient who sits in a wheelchair for prolonged periods should have wheelchair cushions fitted and adjusted on an individualized basis, using pressure measurement techniques as a guide to selection and fitting. The aim is to redistribute pressure away from areas at risk for injuries; however, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1827" title="1827"></span>no cushion can eliminate excessive pressure completely. The patient should be reminded to shift weight frequently and to rise for a few seconds every 15 minutes while sitting in a chair.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Static support devices (e.g., high-density foam, air, or liquid mattress overlays) distribute pressure evenly by bringing more of the patient&#x2019;s body surface into contact with the supporting surface. Gel-type flotation pads and air-fluidized beds reduce pressure. The weight of a body floating on a fluid system is evenly distributed over the entire supporting surface. Therefore, as the body sinks into the fluid, additional surface becomes available for weight bearing, body weight per unit area is decreased, and there is less pressure on the body parts.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Soft, moisture-absorbing padding is also useful because the softness and resilience of padding provide for more even distribution of pressure and the dissipation and absorption of moisture, along with freedom from wrinkles and friction. Bony prominences may be protected by gel pads, sheepskin padding, or soft foam rubber beneath the sacrum, the trochanters, heels, elbows, scapulae, and back of the head when there is pressure on these sites. Applying a gentle adhesive foam dressing to the sacral area is an effective pressure injury preventive measure (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Specialized beds are designed to prevent pressure on the skin. Air-fluidized beds allow the patient to float. Dynamic support surfaces, such as low&#x2013;air-loss pockets, alternatively inflate and deflate sections to change support pressure for patients at high risk for pressure injuries and who are critically ill and cannot be repositioned to relieve pressure. Oscillating or kinetic beds change pressure by means of rocking movements of the bed that redistribute the patient&#x2019;s weight and stimulate circulation. These beds may be used with patients who have injuries attributed to multiple trauma. The specific needs of each individual patient are considered when choosing an appropriate pressure redistribution surface (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> M<span class="small">OBILITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is encouraged to remain active and is ambulated whenever possible. When sitting, the patient is reminded to change positions frequently to redistribute weight. Active and passive exercises increase muscular, skin, and vascular tone. For patients at risk for pressure injuries, turning and exercise schedules are essential, and repositioning must occur around the clock.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> S<span class="small">ENSORY</span> P<span class="small">ERCEPTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse helps the patient recognize and compensate for altered sensory perception. Depending on the origin of the alteration (e.g., decreased level of consciousness, spinal cord lesion), specific interventions are selected. Strategies to improve cognition and sensory perception may include stimulating the patient to increase awareness of self in the environment, encouraging the patient to participate in self-care, or supporting the patient&#x2019;s efforts toward active compensation for loss of sensation (e.g., a patient with paraplegia lifting up from the sitting position every 15 minutes). A patient with tetraplegia should be weight shifted every 30 minutes while sitting in a wheelchair. When decreased sensory perception exists, the patient and caregivers are taught to inspect potential pressure areas visually every morning and evening, using a mirror if necessary, for evidence of pressure injury development.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> T<span class="small">ISSUE</span> P<span class="small">ERFUSION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Activity, exercise, and repositioning improve tissue perfusion. Massage of erythematous areas is avoided because damage to the capillaries and deep tissue may occur (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In patients who have evidence of compromised peripheral circulation (e.g., edema), positioning and elevation of the edematous body part to promote venous return and diminish congestion improve tissue perfusion. In addition, the nurse or family must be alert to environmental factors (e.g., wrinkles in sheets, pressure of tubes) that may contribute to pressure on the skin and diminished circulation and remove the source of pressure.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> N<span class="small">UTRITIONAL</span> S<span class="small">TATUS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient&#x2019;s nutritional status must be adequate, and a positive nitrogen balance must be maintained because pressure injuries develop more quickly and are more resistant to treatment in patients with nutritional disorders. The nurse should assess the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). To assess the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status in response to therapeutic strategies, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s hemoglobin, prealbumin level, and body weight weekly.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals are essential for wound healing (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>). Iron preparations may be necessary to raise the hemoglobin concentration so that tissue oxygen levels can be maintained within acceptable limits. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is necessary for tissue healing. Other nutrients associated with healthy skin include vitamins A, B, D, E, and K, copper, and zinc. With adequate nutrition and hydration, the skin can remain healthy, and damaged tissues can be repaired (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EDUCING</span> F<span class="small">RICTION AND</span> S<span class="small">HEAR</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Raising the head of the bed by even a few centimeters increases the shearing force over the sacral area; therefore, the semireclining position is avoided in patients at risk. Proper positioning with adequate support is also important when the patient is sitting in a chair.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">INIMIZING</span> I<span class="small">RRITATING</span> M<span class="small">OISTURE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Continuous moisture on the skin must be prevented by meticulous hygiene measures. It is important to pay special attention to skin folds, including areas under the breasts, arms, and groin, and between the toes. Perspiration, urine, stool, and drainage must be removed from the skin promptly. The soiled skin should be washed immediately with mild soap and water and blotted dry with a soft towel. The skin may be lubricated with a bland lotion to keep it soft and pliable. Drying agents and powders are avoided. Topical barrier ointments (e.g., petroleum jelly) may be helpful in protecting the skin of patients who are incontinent.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Absorbent pads that wick moisture away from the body should be used to absorb drainage. Patients who are incontinent need to be checked regularly and have their wet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1828" title="1828"></span>incontinence pads and linens changed promptly. Their skin needs to be cleansed and dried promptly.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> P<span class="small">RESSURE</span> I<span class="small">NJURY</span> H<span class="small">EALING</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Regardless of the stage of the pressure injury, the pressure on the area must be eliminated because the injured tissue will not heal until all pressure is removed. The patient must not lie or sit on the pressure injury, even for a few minutes. Individualized positioning and turning schedules must be written in the plan of nursing care and followed meticulously.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, inadequate nutritional status as well as fluid and electrolyte abnormalities must be corrected to promote healing. Wounds from which body fluids and protein drain place the patient in a catabolic state and predispose to hypoproteinemia and serious secondary infections. Protein deficiency must be corrected to promote the healing of the pressure injury. Carbohydrates are necessary to &#x201C;spare&#x201D; the protein and to provide an energy source. Vitamin C and trace elements, especially zinc, are necessary for collagen formation and wound healing. (Refer to <a href="#ct56-2">Chart 56-2</a> for descriptions of stages of pressure injuries.)</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Deep Tissue Pressure Injury.</span> These tissue injuries may evolve rapidly, and immediate pressure relief to the affected area is indicated. Therefore, the nurse must be vigilant in assessing for these types of injuries (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Stage 1 Pressure Injury.</span> To permit healing of stage 1 pressure injuries, the pressure is removed to allow increased tissue perfusion, nutritional and fluid and electrolyte balance is maintained, friction and shear are reduced, and moisture to the skin is avoided (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Stage 2 Pressure Injury.</span> In addition to measures listed for stage 1 pressure injuries, a moist environment, in which migration of epidermal cells over the injury surface occurs more rapidly, should be provided to aid wound healing in stage 2 pressure injury. The injured area is gently cleansed with sterile saline solution. The use of a heat lamp to dry the open wound is avoided, as is the use of antiseptic solutions that damage healthy tissues and delay wound healing. Semipermeable occlusive dressings, hydrocolloid wafers, or wet saline dressings are helpful in providing a moist environment for healing and in minimizing the loss of fluids and proteins from the body (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Stage 3 Pressure Injury.</span> Stage 3 pressure injuries are characterized by extensive tissue damage, including <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;slough:&lt;/b&gt; soft, moist avascular (devitalized) tissue; may be white, yellow, tan, gray, or green; may be loose or firmly adherent">slough</button></strong> (i.e., soft, moist avascular tissue, which may be white, yellow, tan, gray, or green and may be loose or firmly adherent), formation of a sinus tract, and undermining (commonly seen in sheer injuries), to name a few. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;undermining:&lt;/b&gt; area of destroyed tissue that extends extensively under intact skin along the periphery of a wound">Undermining</button></strong> results in extensive tunneling under the edges of the wound; it is distinguished from a sinus tract in that there is a significant portion of the wound edge involved, whereas sinus tract involves only a small portion of the wound edge. Given the extensive damage to tissue and necrosis that characterize stage 3 pressure injuries, they must be d&#x00E9;brided (cleaned) to create an area that will heal, in addition to the measures listed for stage 1 pressure injuries. Necrotic, devitalized tissue favors bacterial growth, delays granulation, and inhibits healing. Wound cleaning and dressing are uncomfortable; therefore, the nurse must prepare the patient for the procedure by explaining what will occur and administering prescribed analgesia (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Stage 4 Pressure Injury.</span> Surgical interventions are required for these extensive pressure injuries (EPUAP, NPIAP, &#x0026; PPPIA, 2019). (See the following Other Treatment Methods section.)</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>O<span class="small">THER</span> T<span class="small">REATMENT</span> M<span class="small">ETHODS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">D&#x00E9;bridement may be accomplished by wet-to-damp dressing changes, mechanical flushing of necrotic and infective exudate, application of prescribed enzyme preparations that dissolve necrotic tissue, or surgical dissection. If eschar (dry scab) covers the pressure injury, it is removed surgically to ensure the wound is clean and vitalized. Exudate may be absorbed by dressings or special hydrophilic powders, beads, or gels. Cultures of infected pressure injuries are obtained to guide the selection of antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After the pressure injury is clean, a topical treatment is prescribed to promote granulation. New granulation tissue must be protected from reinfection, drying, and damage, and care should be taken to prevent pressure and further trauma to the area. Dressings, solutions, and ointments should not disrupt the healing process. For chronic, noninfected injuries that are healing by secondary intention (healing of an open wound from the base upward by laying down new tissue), vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) or hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be used. VAC involves the use of a negative-pressure sponge dressing in the wound to increase blood flow, increasing formation of granulation tissue and nutrient uptake and decreasing bacterial load. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves either applying topical oxygen at increased pressure directly to the wound or placing the patient into a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Both methods of hyperbaric oxygen therapy promote wound healing by stimulating new vascular growth and aiding in the preservation of damaged tissue. In a randomized control study comparing standard wound care with standard wound care and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients with diabetic foot ulcerations, Chen, Wu, Hsu, and colleagues (2017) reported improved wound healing and decreased risk of amputation among study participants who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Multiple agents and protocols are used to treat pressure injuries; however, consistency is an important key to success. Objective evaluation of the pressure injury (e.g., measurement of the size and depth of the pressure injury, inspection for granulation tissue) for response to the treatment protocol must be made every 4 to 6 days. Taking photographs at weekly intervals is a reliable strategy for monitoring the healing process, which may take weeks to months.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Surgical intervention is necessary when the injury is extensive, when complications (e.g., fistula) exist, and when the pressure injury does not respond to treatment. Surgical procedures include d&#x00E9;bridement, incision and drainage, bone resection, and skin grafting. Osteomyelitis is a common complication of wounds of stage 4 depth. (See <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for more information on osteomyelitis.)</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> R<span class="small">ECURRENCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">It may take more than a year for healing tissue to regain the strength of preinjury skin; thus, care must be taken to prevent recurrence of pressure injuries. However, recurrence of pressure injuries should be anticipated; therefore, active, preventive intervention and frequent continuing assessments are essential. Patients with spinal cord injuries are particularly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1829" title="1829"></span>susceptible to pressure injuries and recurrence of pressure injuries; results from one meta-analysis suggest that globally, 23% of patients with spinal cord injuries will have a pressure injury during their lifetime (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4027">Chen, Cai, Du, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s tolerance for sitting or lying on the healed pressure area is increased gradually by increasing the time that pressure is allowed on the area in 5- to 15-minute increments. The patient is instructed to increase mobility and to follow a regimen of turning, weight shifting, and repositioning. The patient education plan includes strategies to reduce the risk for pressure injuries and methods to detect, inspect, and minimize pressure areas. Early recognition and intervention are keys to long-term management of potential impaired skin integrity.</p>
