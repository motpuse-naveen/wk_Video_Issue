<h4 class="h4" id="s3283">Preparedness and Response</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Preparedness and response planning are essential to identify risks of disasters and minimize the negative impact of potential disasters on individuals and communities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3284">Recognition and Awareness</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preparedness for disasters includes devising specific community contingency plans that prepare residents, particularly those who are vulnerable (e.g., older adults, people with disability) for access to necessary life-sustaining resources and for evacuation, as necessary. Preparedness also includes an awareness of the potential for covert use of <strong>weapons of mass destruction (WMD)</strong> (i.e., weapons used to cause widespread death and destruction), self-protection, and early detection, containment, or decontamination of substances and agents that may affect others by secondary exposure. The strength of many toxins, mobility of many members of society, and long incubation periods for some organisms and diseases can result in an epidemic that can quickly and silently spread across the entire country. For example, a formerly healthy person with a rapid onset of pneumonia and respiratory failure can have an ominous illness, such as COVID-19.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should have a heightened awareness of trends that may suggest deliberate dispersal of toxic or infectious agents or the onset of an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic that may include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>An unusual increase in the number of people seeking care for fever, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms</span></li>
<li><span>Clusters of patients who present with the same unusual illness from a single location. For example, clusters can be from a specific geographic location, such as a city, or from a single sporting or entertainment event or social gathering (e.g., wedding, funeral)</span></li>
<li><span>A large number of fatalities, especially when death occurs within 72 hours after hospital admission</span></li>
<li><span>Any increase in disease incidence in a normally healthy population. These cases should be reported to the state health department and to the CDC</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">If any of these trends are noted, a targeted patient history is taken in an attempt to identify the possible agent involved. This history includes an occupational, work, and environmental assessment, in addition to the regular admission history. An exposure history contains, at a minimum, information about current and past exposures to possible hazards and an assessment of the patient&#x2019;s typical day and any deviations in routines. The work history includes, at a minimum, a description of all previous jobs, including short-term, seasonal, and part-time employment and any military service. The environmental history includes an assessment of present and previous home locations, water supply, and any hobbies, to name a few factors. The admission history should include such information as recent travel, especially international travel, and contact with others who have been ill or have recently died of a fatal illness. This is just a brief review of the history that may need to be obtained to identify an exposure agent (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In all cases, unusual trends, suspicions, or findings are reported to the appropriate resources in the facility and to proper authorities in the community. Resources can include the infection control department, the state health department, the CDC, the local poison control center, various internet sites, and <strong>material safety data sheets (MSDS)</strong> (see the Resources section). The MSDS provides information to employees and health care providers regarding specific chemical agents; it includes the chemical name, physical data, chemical ingredients, fire and explosive hazard data, health and reactive data, spill or leak procedures, special protection information, and special precautions. Reporting furnishes data elements to those agencies responsible for epidemiology and response. Reporting also allows for sharing of information among facilities and jurisdictions and can help determine the source of infections or exposure and prevent further exposures and even deaths (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4726">Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], 2012</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patterns of illness can continue to evolve during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics that involve novel pathogens. For instance, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was thought that children could not become infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, as the virus continued to spread, it became clear that the number of children infected was, in fact, equivalent to the rate of infection in adults. The majority of children who were infected, however, experienced much milder symptoms. It was only after cases in New York City peaked and began to decline that pediatricians began to see a new pattern in which dozens of children exposed to COVID-19 were becoming extremely ill, yet presented with different symptoms than adults. The CDC (2020d) began to warn of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a condition which causes inflammatory changes to a variety of organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. The cause remains unknown, but many of the children with MIS-C had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or had been exposed to someone who had the virus. MIS-C can be serious and even deadly without prompt medical care (CDC, 2020d).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3285">Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Another component of preparedness and response involves the protection of the health care provider by additional PPE. Chemical or biologic agents and radiation are silent killers and are generally colorless and odorless. The purpose of PPE is to shield health care workers from the chemical, physical, biologic, and radiologic hazards that may exist when caring for patients who have been contaminated or who can spread contagion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2228" title="2228"></span>(EPA) has divided protective clothing and respiratory protection into the following four categories, levels A through D:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Level A</em> protection is worn when the highest level of respiratory, skin, eye, and mucous membrane protection is required. This includes a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and a fully encapsulating, vapor-tight, chemical-resistant suit with chemical-resistant gloves and boots.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Level B</em> protection requires the highest level of respiratory protection but a lesser level of skin and eye protection than with level A situations. This level of protection includes the SCBA and a chemical-resistant suit, but the suit is not vapor tight.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Level C</em> protection requires an air-purified respirator, which uses filters or sorbent materials to remove harmful substances from the air. A chemical-resistant coverall with splash hood, chemical-resistant gloves, and boots are included in level C protection.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Level D</em> protection is the typical work uniform and is used for nuisance contamination only; it does not provide adequate protection in cases in which respiratory or skin threats are present. Other PPE such as gloves or mask may be required based on the situation.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Levels C and D PPE are the levels most often used in hospital facilities. Protective equipment must be donned before contact with a patient who has been contaminated. The acute care facility&#x2019;s standard precaution PPE (level D) generally is not adequate for protection from a patient who has been chemically, biologically, or radiologically contaminated. Level C PPE is adequate for the average patient exposure. The health care provider must use equipment that is capable of providing protection against the agent involved. This may mean using a splash suit along with a full-face positive- or negative-pressure respirator (a filter-type gas mask) or even an SCBA for medical personnel in the field.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Whole-Process Training to Improve Use of Personal Protective Equipment</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Tan, W., Ye, Y., Yang, Y., et&#x00A0;al. (2020). Whole-process emergency training of personal protective equipment helps healthcare workers against COVID-19. <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em><em>,</em> <em>62</em>(6). 420&#x2013;423.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Health care workers are at increased risk of exposure to the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Without proper knowledge of the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), health care professionals are more susceptible to infection, illness, and possibly death. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a three-phase training program on the proper use of PPE for health care workers in China.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study was developed in a hospital system in Beijing, China, where health care workers were caring for patients who had a known or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. Qualified instructors and training assistants developed an educational program on appropriate use of PPE (e.g., hats, N95 respirators, goggles, face shields, shoe covers, and protective coveralls) across various areas of workflow (e.g., clean, possibly contaminated, contaminated). Teaching strategies included lecture and demonstration by faculty, followed by simulation, which allowed participants to practice what they had learned prior to being evaluated in phase three. Program developers established scoring criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of participants&#x2019; performance. Two researchers independently scored participants on a variety of predetermined outcomes (e.g., proficiency levels) before and after the training sessions. Paired <em>t</em> tests were used to analyze differences in scores before and after the educational session. Prior to conducting large-scale training and evaluation, researchers conducted an experimental or pilot study using a smaller number of participants.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Thirty-eight health care workers participated in the initial experimental training, including 31 nurses. Significant differences were found between pre- and posttest scores. Almost three quarters of the participants (73.68%) did not pass the pretest. However, 100% were successful following the educational program. Subsequently, 263 health care workers participated in the large-scale training, including 225 nurses; posttest scores were also significantly improved in this sample. Participants struggled the most with the use of N95 respirators and protective coveralls.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Multimodal educational programs, which include simulation have the potential to provide critical educational experiences for nurses that assist in keeping them safe and reducing the transmission of life-threatening viruses. Simulation enables experts to guide health care workers during an extremely stressful time and allows learners to practice the skills they need to protect themselves, their coworkers, and their patients. Such programs are essential in preparing an educated workforce to be ready to face the next pandemic or crisis.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">No single PPE is capable of protecting against all hazards. Under no circumstances should responders wear any PPE without proper training, practice, and fit testing of respirator masks as necessary (OSHA, 2017). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct68-4">Chart 68-4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">N95 respirator masks are used to reduce the nurse&#x2019;s exposure to particles, which include small-particle aerosols and large droplets (see <a href="#ff68-1">Fig. 68-1</a>). The mask filters out at least 95% <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2229" title="2229"></span>of airborne particles and, in ideal situations, should be discarded after each patient encounter or aerosol-generating procedure. The mask should be discarded when it becomes damaged or deformed, no longer forms an effective seal to the face, becomes wet or visibly dirty, breathing becomes difficult, or it becomes contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluid (CDC, 2020e). Alternatively, a regular surgical mask provides the nurse protection against large droplets, splashes or sprays, bodily or other hazardous fluids, and protects the patient from the nurse&#x2019;s respiratory emissions. This mask does not require a tight seal, does not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles, and is not considered respiratory protection. Ideally, surgical masks should also be discarded after each patient encounter (CDC, 2020e). The CDC provides guidance to health care facilities regarding when it is appropriate to wear an N95 respirator mask versus a regular surgical mask during patient encounters. The N95 respirator mask must be evaluated, tested, and approved for the individual prior to wearing per facility policy and procedures.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3286">Decontamination</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;decontamination:&lt;/b&gt; process of removing, or rendering harmless, contaminants that have accumulated on personnel, patients, and equipment">Decontamination</button></strong>, the process of removing accumulated contaminants or rendering them harmless, is critical to the health and safety of health care providers by preventing secondary contamination. The decontamination plan should establish procedures and educate employees about decontamination procedures, identify the equipment needed and methods to be used, and establish methods for disposal of contaminated materials (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although many principles and theories surround decontamination of a patient, authorities agree that to be effective, decontamination must include a minimum of two steps. First step is the removal of the patient&#x2019;s clothing and jewelry and then rinsing the patient with water. Depending on the type of exposure, this step alone can remove a large amount of the contamination and decrease secondary contamination. The second step consists of a thorough soap-and-water wash and rinse. The hospital must be prepared to perform additional decontamination prior to entry into the facility. The hospital personnel may also treat &#x201C;walking wounded&#x201D; who did not receive any decontamination at the scene (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4702">Tintinalli et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
