<h4 class="h4" id="s62">Nutritional Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nutrition is important to maintain health and to prevent disease and premature death. When illness or injury occurs, optimal nutrition is essential for recovery, healing, and for resisting infection and other complications. An in-depth nutritional assessment is often integrated into the health history and physical examination. Assessment of a patient&#x2019;s nutritional status provides information about obesity, undernutrition, and malnutrition.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain signs that suggest possible nutritional deficiency, such as muscle wasting, poor skin integrity, loss of subcutaneous tissue, and obesity, are easy to note because they are evident and objective. Other physical signs may be subtle, or the patient may report subjective symptoms, which must be carefully assessed. It is important to note that some signs and symptoms that appear to indicate nutritional deficiency may actually reflect other systemic conditions (e.g., endocrine disorders, infectious disease). Others may result from impaired digestion, absorption, excretion, or storage of nutrients in the body (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Disorders caused by nutritional deficiency, overeating, or eating unhealthy foods are among the leading causes of illness and death in the United States today. Examples of health problems associated with poor nutrition include obesity, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, diverticulitis, and eating disorders.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 85</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page86" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="86">p. 86</span></div>
<p class="indent"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Obesity is a major concern for children, adolescents, and adults in the United States and globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Obesity and being overweight are leading risk factors for global deaths; most of the world&#x2019;s population lives in countries where overweight and obesity kill more people than underweight. In addition, coronary artery disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and certain cancers can be attributable to obesity (WHO, 2019) (see <a href="c42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a> for a detailed discussion of obesity).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s63">Lifespan Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When the nurse conducts a nutritional assessment, two age groups merit special consideration: adolescents and older adults. Key considerations for each group are highlighted below.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Adolescents</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adolescence is a time of critical growth and when lifelong eating and exercise habits are established. Nutritional assessment is particularly important during this time period. In general, adolescents gain 40% of their adult weight and 15% of their adult height during this developmental stage of life (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Lassi, Moin, &#x0026; Bhutta, 2017</a>). It is vital to assess for obesity in adolescents to prevent complications from obesity as they grow and develop, as well as when they enter adulthood.</p>
<p class="indent">Adolescent girls should consume approximately 1400 to 2400 calories daily; whereas, adolescent boys require between 1600 to 3200 calories each day to support their greater growth needs in terms of both overall size and muscle mass. Athletes of either gender may need to consume up to 5000 calories daily to support their metabolic demands. In adolescents of both genders, sufficient micronutrients such as calcium, B-complex vitamins, iron, and folate are necessary to support increased metabolic activity during this time of growth. Adolescent girls are at particular nutritional risk, because they are thought to be exposed to expectations to diet and maintain a thin body. As a consequence, many adolescent girls are purposely deficient in their intake of dairy products, because they are caloric-rich. However, dairy products provide an important source of calcium that is necessary in order to build bone mass. Adolescents of both genders are at risk for behavioral eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating disorders, although girls are at greater risk (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Lassi et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Older Adults</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults are also at risk for altered nutrition. Nutritional assessment in the older adult should include inquiry about the patient&#x2019;s current dietary practices as well as a nutritional screening to assess for adequate nutrition. The Mini Nutritional Assessment is a commonly used, well-validated tool developed specifically for this purpose (<a href="#ct4-5">Chart&#x00A0;4-5</a>). Many older adults adhere to specific diets, such as those low in saturated fat or sodium, for improving or maintaining health. Proper nutrition for an older adult meets daily requirements, maintains ideal body weight, and addresses specific health concerns such as cardiovascular or renal disease (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults are particularly at high risk for poor nutrition due to factors that may include social isolation, frailty, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy (i.e., use of multiple prescription and OTC medications), reduced functional status, and financial instability (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib223">Astrup &#x0026; O&#x2019;Connor, 2018</a>). Disorders affecting any part of the gastrointestinal tract can alter nutritional requirements and health status in people of any age; however, such disorders are likely to occur more quickly and more frequently in older adults. Acute and chronic diseases may affect the metabolism and utilization of nutrients, which already are altered by the aging process. Even well older adults may be nutritionally at risk because of decreased odor perception, poor dental health, limited ability to shop and cook, financial hardship, and the fact that they often eat alone (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Polypharmacy also may place older adults at risk nutritionally. The number of adverse reactions increases proportionately with the number of medications taken. Age-related physiologic and pathophysiologic changes may alter the metabolism and elimination of many medications (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Medications can influence food intake by producing side effects such as nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and changes in cognition. They may also interfere with the distribution, utilization, and storage of nutrients.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s64">Components of Nutritional Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The sequence of the assessment may vary; however, evaluation of a patient&#x2019;s nutritional status includes the use of one or more of the following methods: measurement of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, biochemical assessment, clinical examination findings, and dietary data. Measurement of BMI and waist circumference is recommended to determine whether a patient has obesity (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Body Mass Index, Ideal Weight, and Waist Circumference</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Body mass index (BMI)</strong> is a ratio based on body weight and height (<a href="#tt4-1">Table&#x00A0;4-1</a>). The obtained value is compared to established standards; however, trends or changes in values over time are considered more useful than isolated or one-time measurements. BMI is highly correlated with body fat, although increased lean body mass or a large body frame can also increase the BMI. People who have a BMI lower than 18.5 (or who are 80% or less of their desirable body weight for height) are at increased risk for problems associated with poor nutritional status. In addition, a low BMI is associated with a higher mortality rate among hospitalized patients and community-dwelling older adults. Those who have a BMI between 25 and 29.9 are considered overweight. Obesity is defined as a BMI of greater than 30 (WHO, 2019). Although there are no current standard recommendations for BMI based on race or ethnicity, there is literature to support that BMI and body fat percentages can vary between genders and among people of different ages and from different ethnic groups (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib241">McConnell-Nzunga, Naylor, Macdonald, et al., 2018</a>). In analyzing BMI, the nurse must be aware that there may be weight variance that could be dependent upon age, gender, and ethnicity.</p>

<p class="BoxpPARA">The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) is a six-item tool designed to identify adults aged 65 y and older who are either malnourished or at risk for becoming malnourished. It is available in several languages and there are several methods of delivery, including self-assessment as well as an electronic health record (EHR) version. It provides a more sensitive measure than body mass index (BMI) in identifying older adults in long-term care facilities at risk for malnutrition (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib245">Nestl&#x00E9; Nutrition Institute, 2011</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">It is important to assess for usual body weight and height and to compare these values with ideal weight (see <a href="c42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>, <a href="c42-sec01.xhtml#ff42-3">Fig.&#x00A0;42-3</a>). Current weight does not provide information about recent changes in weight; therefore, patients are asked about their usual body weight and any recent weight loss or gain. Loss of height may be attributable to osteoporosis&#x2014;an important problem related to nutrition, especially in postmenopausal women (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the calculation of BMI, waist circumference measurement is a useful assessment tool. To measure waist circumference, a tape measure is placed in a horizontal plane around the abdomen at the level of the iliac crest. A waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women indicates excess abdominal fat. Those with a high waist circumference are at an increased risk for diabetes, dyslipidemias, hypertension, heart attack, and stroke (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Hogan-Quigley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Biochemical Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Biochemical measurements are applicable to a patient&#x2019;s nutritional assessment as they can test the level of a given nutrient and reflect abnormalities of metabolism in relation to the utilization of nutrients. Tests of serum and urine are done to determine whether the values are within an acceptable range. Some of these tests, while reflecting recent intake of the elements detected, can also identify a long-term deficiency (below-normal levels) even when there are no clinical symptoms of deficiency.</p>
<p class="indent">Low serum albumin and prealbumin levels are most often used as measures of protein deficit in adults. Albumin synthesis depends on normal liver function and an adequate supply of amino acids. Because the body stores a large amount of albumin, the serum albumin level may not decrease until malnutrition is severe; therefore, its usefulness in detecting recent protein depletion is limited. Decreased albumin levels may be caused by overhydration, liver or renal disease, or excessive protein loss due to burns, major surgery, infection, or cancer. Serial measurements of prealbumin levels are used to assess the effectiveness of nutritional therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Additional laboratory data, such as levels of transferrin and retinol-binding protein, and complete blood and electrolyte counts, are used in many institutions. Transferrin is a protein that binds and carries iron from the intestine through the serum. Because of its short half-life, transferrin levels decrease more quickly than albumin levels in response to protein depletion. Low levels of transferrin can also lead to a deficiency in iron; low availability of iron in the body limits the synthesis of functioning hemoglobin causing anemia. Although measurement of retinol-binding protein is not available from many laboratories, it may be a useful means of monitoring acute, short-term changes in protein status. The total lymphocyte count may be reduced in people who are acutely malnourished as a result of stress and low-calorie feeding, as well as in those with impaired cellular immunity. Anergy, or the absence of an immune response to injection of small concentrations of recall antigen under the skin, may also indicate malnutrition because of delayed antibody synthesis and response. Serum electrolyte levels provide information about fluid and electrolyte balance and kidney function.</p>
<p class="indent">A 24-hour urine collection can be utilized to calculate the creatinine/height index that assesses metabolically active tissue and indicates the degree of protein depletion. The amount of creatinine is measured and the index is calculated on the basis of the patient&#x2019;s height and gender. The patient&#x2019;s creatinine/height index is then compared to normal ranges based on the expected body weight by height. Values lower than normal may indicate loss of lean body mass and protein malnutrition (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Clinical Examination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The state of nutrition is often reflected in a person&#x2019;s appearance. Although the most obvious physical sign of good nutrition is a normal body weight with respect to height, body frame, and age, other tissues can serve as indicators of general nutritional status and adequate intake of specific nutrients; these include the hair, skin, teeth, gums, mucous membranes, mouth and tongue, skeletal muscles, abdomen, lower extremities, and thyroid gland (<a href="#tt4-2">Table&#x00A0;4-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dietary Data</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Commonly used methods of determining individual eating patterns include the food record, the 24-hour food recall, and a dietary interview. Each of these methods helps estimate whether food intake is adequate and appropriate. If these methods are used to obtain the dietary history, instructions must be given to the patient about measuring and recording food intake.</p>
<p class="h7">Methods of Collecting Data</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse may employ multiple methods to collect a patient&#x2019;s dietary data. Two common methods described here include the food record and the 24-hour recall.</p>
<p class="h8">Food Record</p>
<p class="nonindent">The food record, also called the food diary, is used most often in nutritional status studies. A person is instructed to keep a record of food consumed over a period of time, varying from 3 to 7 days, and to accurately estimate and describe the specific foods consumed. Food records are fairly accurate if the person is willing to provide factual information and is able to estimate food quantities.</p>

<p class="h8">24-Hour Recall</p>
<p class="nonindent">As the name implies, the 24-hour recall method is a recall of food intake over a 24-hour period. A person is asked to recall all foods eaten during the previous day and to estimate the quantities of each food consumed. Because information does not always represent usual intake, at the end of the interview the patient is asked whether the previous day&#x2019;s food intake was typical. To obtain supplementary information about the typical diet, it is also necessary to ask how frequently the person eats foods from the major food groups.</p>
<p class="h7">Dietary Interview</p>
<p class="nonindent">The success of the interviewer in obtaining information for dietary assessment depends on effective communication, which requires that good rapport be established to promote respect and trust. The interview is conducted in a nondirective and exploratory way, allowing the respondent to express feelings and thoughts while encouraging them to answer specific questions. The manner in which questions are asked influences the respondent&#x2019;s cooperation. The interviewer must be nonjudgmental and avoid expressing disapproval by verbal comments or facial expression.</p>
<p class="indent">Several questions may be necessary to elicit the information needed. When attempting to elicit information about the type and quantity of food eaten at a particular time, open-ended questions should be utilized. In addition, assumptions should not be made about the size of servings; instead, questions are phrased to clearly determine the quantities. For example, to help determine the size of one hamburger, the patient may be asked, &#x201C;How many servings were prepared with the pound of meat you bought?&#x201D; Another approach to determining quantities is to use food models of known sizes in estimating portions of meat, cake, or pie, or to record quantities in common measurements, such as cups or spoonfuls (or the size of containers when discussing intake of bottled beverages).</p>
<p class="indent">In recording a particular combination dish, such as a casserole, it is useful to ask about the ingredients, recording the largest quantities first. When recording quantities of ingredients, the interviewer notes whether the food item was raw or cooked and the number of servings provided by the recipe. When a patient lists the foods for the recall questionnaire, it may help read back the list of foods and ask whether anything was forgotten, such as condiments, fruit, cake, candy, between-meal snacks, or alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p class="h7">Cultural, Ethnic, and Religious Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Individuals&#x2019; culture, ethnicity, or personal beliefs determine to a large extent which foods are eaten and how they are prepared and served. Cultural and religious practices can determine whether certain foods are prohibited (<a href="#ct4-6">Chart&#x00A0;4-6</a>) and whether certain foods and spices are eaten on holidays or at specific family gatherings. Because of the value of food pattern choices to many individuals, the nurse must be sensitive to these choices when obtaining a dietary history. Equally important, the nurse must not stereotype individuals and assume that because they are from a certain culture or religious group, they adhere to specific dietary customs. Specific eating patterns, such as vegan or vegetarian, should be explored so that appropriate dietary recommendations can be offered (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] &#x0026; HHS, 2019). Deficiencies in certain diets may cause disorders such as anemia (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for further discussion).</p>

<p class="indent">The cultural context of food varies widely but usually includes one or more of the following: relief of hunger; promotion of health and healing; prevention of disease or illness; expression of caring for another; promotion of interpersonal closeness among individual people, families, groups, communities, or nations; and promotion of kinship and family alliances. Food is also associated with strengthening of social ties; observance of life events (e.g., birthdays, marriages, funerals); expression of gratitude or appreciation; recognition of achievement or accomplishment; validation of social, cultural, or religious ceremonial functions; facilitation of business negotiations; and expression of affluence, wealth, or social status.</p>
<p class="indent">Culture influences which foods are served and when they are served, the number and frequency of meals, who eats with whom, and who receives the choicest portions. Culture also may influence how foods are prepared and served, how they are eaten (with chopsticks, hands, or fork, knife, and spoon), and where people shop (e.g., ethnic grocery stores, specialty food markets). Culture also determines the impact of excess weight and obesity on self-esteem and social standing. In some cultures, physical bulk is viewed as a sign of affluence and health (e.g., a chubby baby is a healthy baby).</p>
<p class="indent">Religious practices may include fasting (e.g., Catholics, Buddhists, Jews, Muslims) and abstaining from selected foods at particular times (e.g., Catholics abstain from meat on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays during Lent). Practices may also include the ritualistic use of food and beverages (e.g., Passover dinner, consumption of bread and wine during religious ceremonies; see <a href="#ct4-6">Chart&#x00A0;4-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most groups feast, often in the company of family and friends, on selected holidays. For example, many Christians eat large dinners on Christmas and Easter and consume other traditional high-calorie, high-fat foods, such as seasonal cookies, pastries, and candies. These culturally based dietary practices are especially significant in the care of patients with diabetes, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, and other conditions in which diet plays a key role in the treatment and health maintenance regimen.</p>
<p class="h7">Evaluating Dietary Information</p>
<p class="nonindent">After obtaining basic dietary information, the nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s dietary intake and communicates the information to the dietitian and the rest of the health care team for more detailed assessment and clinical nutrition intervention. If the goal is to determine whether the patient generally eats a healthful diet, their food intake may be compared with the dietary guidelines outlined in the USDA&#x2019;s Center for Nutrition Policy &#x0026; Promotion&#x2019;s MyPlate (<a href="#ff4-5">Fig.&#x00A0;4-5</a>). Foods are divided into five major groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy), plus oils. Recommendations are provided related to variety in the diet, proportion of food from each food group, and moderation in eating fats, oils, and sweets. A patient&#x2019;s food intake is compared with recommendations based on various food groups for different age groups and activity levels (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If nurses or dietitians are interested in knowing about the intake of specific nutrients, such as vitamin A, iron, or calcium, the patient&#x2019;s food intake is analyzed by consulting a list <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page91" title="91"></span>of foods and their composition and nutrient content. The diet is analyzed in terms of grams and milligrams of specific nutrients. The total nutritive value is then compared with the recommended dietary allowances specific for the patient&#x2019;s age category, gender, and special circumstances such as pregnancy or lactation.</p>

<p class="indent">Fat intake and cholesterol levels are additional aspects of the nutritional assessment. Trans fats are produced when hydrogen atoms are added to monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats to produce a semisolid product, such as margarine. Partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the primary source of industrially produced trans fats, are found in many popular processed foods, such as baked goods and frozen foods. This is a concern because increased amounts of trans fats have been associated with increased risk for heart disease and stroke. In 2015, the FDA released its final determination that PHOs were not <em>Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS).</em></p>
<p class="indent">At that time, the FDA announced that manufacturers must stop adding PHOs to processed food, providing a 3-year compliance period so that food manufacturers could gradually phase out the use of PHOs. However, to allow for an orderly transition in the marketplace, FDA extended the compliance date for these foods (FDA, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s65">Factors Influencing Nutritional Status in Various Situations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who are hospitalized may have an inadequate dietary intake because of the illness or disorder that necessitated the hospital stay. Patients who are at home may feel too sick or fatigued to shop and prepare food, or they may be unable to eat because of other physical problems or limitations. Limited or fixed incomes or the high costs of medications may result in insufficient money to buy nutritious foods. Culturally influenced food patterns can also affect nutritional status. Because complex treatments (e.g., mechanical ventilation, intravenous infusions, chemotherapy) once used only in the hospital setting are now being provided in the home and outpatient settings, nutritional assessment of patients in these settings is an important aspect of home and community-based care. Many of the factors that contribute to poor nutritional status are identified in <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#tt4-3">Table&#x00A0;4-3</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s66">Analysis of Nutritional Status</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Physical measurements (BMI, waist circumference) and biochemical and dietary data are used in combination to determine a patient&#x2019;s nutritional status. Often, these data provide more information about the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status than the clinical examination, which may not detect subclinical deficiencies unless they become so advanced that overt signs develop. A low intake of nutrients over a long period may lead to low biochemical levels and, without nutritional intervention, may result in characteristic and observable signs and symptoms. A plan of action for nutritional intervention is based on the results of the dietary assessment and the patient&#x2019;s clinical examination. To be effective, the plan should include a healthy diet, maintenance (or control) of weight, and compensation for increased nutritional needs.</p>
