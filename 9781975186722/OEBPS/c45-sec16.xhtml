<h4 class="h4" id="s1973">Thyroid Cancer</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer of the thyroid is less prevalent than other forms of cancer; however, the incidence has tripled in the last 30 years (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3410">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2019</a>) and accounts for 90% of endocrine malignancies. Although it has the fastest-growing cancer rate among both men and women, women are three times more likely to develop this cancer than men. In addition, thyroid cancer is more likely to develop in patients that are younger than 50 years (ACS, 2019; <a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3429">Yoo, Yu, &#x0026; Choi, 2018</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Lifestyle Factors and the Risk of Thyroid Cancer</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Yoo, Y. G., Yu, B. J., &#x0026; Choi, E. (2018) A comparison study: The risk factors in the lifestyles of thyroid cancer patients and healthy adults of South Korea. <em>Cancer Nursing</em>, <em>41</em>(1), E48&#x2013;E56.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In South Korea and in the United States, rates of thyroid cancer have increased significantly. This study investigated which risk factors might be influencing the rates of thyroid cancer in South Korea.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This retrospective comparison study compared a group of patients with thyroid cancer to a group of healthy adults. The Health Belief Model framework guided the study. The Lifestyle Measurement Scale was used to assess the 6 domains of dietary habits, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, rest and physical activity, stress management, and annual physical and health screenings. Participants self-completed the surveys.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">There were 217 usable surveys completed. In the patient group (<em>n</em> = 102), mean age was 50 years; in the healthy adult group (<em>n</em> = 115), 52 years. In both the patient group and the healthy adult group, females made up the majority (85% and 76%, respectively) and most of the participants were married (94% and 93%, respectively). A history of previous smoking, lower physical activity levels, higher stress, and unhealthy eating habits (consumption of more instant food products and fewer vegetables) were all identified as risk factors for developing thyroid cancer.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">All health care professionals can be instrumental in helping prevent thyroid cancer. Nurses should encourage higher physical activity levels, effective stress management, avoidance of direct and indirect exposure to smoking, and a healthy diet that includes consumption of fewer instant food products and more vegetables to help in prevention efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">External radiation of the head, neck, or chest in infancy and childhood increases the risk of thyroid carcinoma. The incidence of thyroid cancer appears to increase 5 to 40 years after irradiation. Consequently, people who underwent radiation treatment or were otherwise exposed to radiation as children should consult their primary provider, request an isotope thyroid scan as part of the evaluation, follow recommended treatment of abnormalities of the gland, and continue with annual checkups.</p>
<p class="indent">Additional risk factors that have been identified include smoking, low physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and high stress levels (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3429">Yoo et al., 2018</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct45-8">Chart 45-8</a> for more information on lifestyle risk factors.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1974">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lesions that are single, hard, and fixed on palpation or associated with cervical lymphadenopathy suggest malignancy. Thyroid function tests may be helpful in evaluating thyroid nodules and masses; however, results are rarely conclusive. An ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of the thyroid gland is the standard diagnostic procedure for evaluating thyroid nodules. It is performed as an outpatient procedure to make a diagnosis of thyroid cancer, to differentiate cancerous thyroid nodules from noncancerous nodules, and to stage the cancer if detected (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Amdur &#x0026; Dagan, 2019</a>). The procedure is safe and usually requires only a local anesthetic agent. Additional diagnostic studies include ultrasound, MRI, CT, thyroid scans, radioactive iodine uptake studies, and thyroid suppression tests.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1975">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The medical management depends on the classification of cell type found on biopsy. The three common groups include well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Amdur &#x0026; Dagan, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The treatment of choice for localized thyroid carcinoma is surgical removal (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Amdur &#x0026; Dagan, 2019</a>). Total or near-total thyroidectomy is performed if possible (ACS, 2019). Modified neck dissection or more extensive radical neck dissection is performed if there is lymph node involvement.</p>
<p class="indent">Efforts are made to spare parathyroid tissue to reduce the risk of postoperative hypocalcemia and tetany. After surgery, ablation procedures are carried out with radioactive iodine to eradicate residual microscopic disease (ACS, 2019). Radioactive iodine is also used for thyroid cancers with metastasis (ACS, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">After surgery, thyroid hormone is given to lower the levels of TSH to a euthyroid state (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Riek, 2019</a>). If the remaining thyroid tissue is inadequate to produce sufficient thyroid hormone, thyroxine is required permanently.</p>
<p class="indent">Several routes are available for administering radiation to the thyroid or tissues of the neck, including oral administration of radioactive iodine (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Riek, 2019</a>) and external administration of radiation therapy. Administration of radioactive iodine for DTC is the most successful targeted therapy in oncology (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Amdur &#x0026; Dagan, 2019</a>). Short-term side effects of radioactive iodine treatment may include neck soreness, nausea, and upset stomach; tender and swollen salivary glands; dry mouth; changes in taste; and, rarely, pain (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Riek, 2019</a>). The patient who receives external sources of radiation therapy is at risk for mucositis, dryness of the mouth, dysphagia, redness of the skin, anorexia, and fatigue (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Chemotherapy is infrequently used to treat thyroid cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients whose thyroid cancer is detected early, who are younger than 50 years, and who are appropriately treated have a good prognosis (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Amdur &#x0026; Dagan, 2019</a>). Patients who have had papillary cancer&#x2014;the most common and least aggressive tumor&#x2014;have the best prognosis of all thyroid cancers (ACS, 2019). Long-term survival is also common in follicular cancer, which is a more aggressive form of thyroid cancer (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Riek, 2019</a>). However, continued thyroid hormone therapy and periodic follow-up and diagnostic testing are important to ensure the patient&#x2019;s well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">Later follow-up includes clinical assessment for recurrence of nodules or masses in the neck and signs of hoarseness, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1469" title="1469"></span>dysphagia, or dyspnea. The recommendations for long-term follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer are based on the stage of cancer and results of the follow-up examination 1 year following the initial treatment. The first year evaluation includes clinical examination, TSH and free thyroxine, and measurement of serum thyroglobulin within 6 months following the initial treatment, and a routine neck ultrasound with the first 6 to 12 months following initial treatment. Tests used to confirm sites of metastasis if there is clinical evidence of recurrence include radioiodine imaging, CT, MRI, skeletal x-rays, and skeletal radionucleotide imaging.</p>
<p class="indent">Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is useful to establish prognosis if there is evidence of distant metastases (ACS, 2019). Free T<sub>4</sub>, TSH, and serum calcium and phosphorus levels are monitored to determine whether the thyroid hormone supplementation is adequate and to note whether calcium balance is maintained.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient education emphasizes the importance of taking prescribed medications and following recommendations for follow-up monitoring. The patient who is undergoing radiation therapy is also instructed in how to assess and manage side effects of treatment (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1976">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Important preoperative goals are to prepare the patient for surgery and reduce anxiety. Often, the patient&#x2019;s home life has become tense because of their restlessness, irritability, and nervousness secondary to hyperthyroidism. Efforts are necessary to protect the patient from tension and stress to avoid precipitating thyroid storm. Suggestions are made to limit stressful situations. Quiet and relaxing activities are encouraged.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Preoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient about the importance of eating a diet high in carbohydrates and proteins. A high daily caloric intake is necessary because of the increased metabolic activity and rapid depletion of glycogen reserves. Supplementary vitamins, particularly thiamine and ascorbic acid, may be prescribed. The patient is reminded to avoid tea, coffee, cola, and other stimulants.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse also informs the patient about the purpose of preoperative tests, if they are to be performed, and explains what preoperative preparations to expect. This information should help to reduce the patient&#x2019;s anxiety about the surgery. In addition, special efforts are made to ensure a good night&#x2019;s rest before surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperative education includes demonstrating to the patient how to support the neck with the hands after surgery to prevent stress on the incision. This involves raising the elbows and placing the hands behind the neck to provide support and reduce strain and tension on the neck muscles and the surgical incision.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Postoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the postoperative period, the priorities are to observe for any difficulty in breathing due to edema of the glottis, hematoma formation, or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve which requires the insertion of an airway, and to monitor the pulse and blood pressure for any indication of internal bleeding. The nurse must be alert for complaints of a sensation of pressure or fullness at the incision site which may indicate subcutaneous hemorrhage and hematoma formation and should be reported. In addition, the nurse periodically assesses the surgical dressings and reinforces as necessary. When the patient is in a recumbent position, the nurse observes the sides and the back of the neck as well as the anterior dressing for bleeding. A tracheostomy set is kept at the bedside at all times, and the surgeon is summoned at the first indication of respiratory distress. If the respiratory distress is caused by hematoma, surgical evacuation is required.</p>
<p class="indent">The intensity of pain is assessed, and analgesic agents are given as prescribed for pain. The nurse should anticipate apprehension in the patient and should inform the patient that oxygen will assist breathing. When moving and turning the patient, the nurse carefully supports the patient&#x2019;s head and avoids tension on the sutures. The most comfortable position is the semi-Fowler position, with the head elevated and supported by pillows.</p>
<p class="indent">IV fluids are given during the immediate postoperative period. Water may be given by mouth as soon as nausea subsides and bowel sounds are present. Usually, there is a little difficulty in swallowing; initially, cold fluids and ice may be taken better than other fluids. Often, patients prefer a soft diet to a liquid diet in the immediate postoperative period.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is advised to talk as little as possible to reduce edema to the vocal cords; however, when the patient does speak, any voice changes are noted, indicating possible injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which lies just behind the thyroid next to the trachea. An overbed table is provided for access to frequently used items so that the patient avoids turning their head. The table can also be used to support a humidifier when vapor-mist inhalations are prescribed for the relief of excessive mucous accumulation.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>An essential assessment following a thyroidectomy is of voice changes. Difficulty in speaking (the act of moving air to vibrate vocal cords) may indicate increasing edema, damage to laryngeal nerve, or hemorrhage and should be reported immediately.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The patient is encouraged to be out of bed as soon as possible and to eat foods that are easily swallowed. A high-calorie diet may be prescribed to promote weight gain. The incision may be closed using absorbable sutures, nonabsorbable sutures, and adhesive strips. Absorbable sutures dissolve within the body. If nonabsorbable sutures are used, the timeline for removal may vary; however, these types of sutures are usually removed 5 to 7 days following surgery. Adhesives will peel off spontaneously. The patient is usually discharged from the hospital on the day of surgery or soon afterward if the postoperative course is uncomplicated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hemorrhage, hematoma formation, edema of the glottis, and injury to the laryngeal nerve are complications reviewed previously in this chapter. Occasionally in thyroid surgery, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1470" title="1470"></span>the parathyroid glands are injured or removed, producing a disturbance in calcium metabolism. As the blood calcium level falls, hyperirritability of the nerves occurs, with spasms of the hands and feet and muscle twitching (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>). This group of symptoms is termed <em>tetany,</em> and the nurse must immediately report its appearance because laryngospasm, although rare, may occur and obstruct the airway. Tetany of this type is usually treated with IV calcium gluconate. This calcium abnormality is usually temporary after thyroidectomy unless all parathyroid tissues were removed.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Following thyroid surgery, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of tetany, including hyperirritability of the nerves, with spasms of the hands and feet and muscle twitching. Laryngospasm, although rare, may occur and obstruct the airway.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Predischarge education is essential because these patients have short hospital stays. The patient, family, and caregivers need to be knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms that should be reported. Discharge education includes strategies for managing postoperative pain at home and for increasing humidification. The nurse explains to the patient and family the need for rest, relaxation, and adequate nutrition and to avoid putting strain on the incision and sutures. The patient is permitted to resume their former activities and responsibilities completely once recovered from surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Family responsibilities and factors relating to the home environment that produce emotional tension have often been implicated as precipitating causes of thyrotoxicosis. A home visit provides an opportunity to evaluate these factors and to suggest ways to improve the home and family environment. If indicated, a referral to home, community-based or transitional care is made. The nurse reviews the history; performs a physical assessment; assesses the surgical incision; develops a plan of care with the patient and family; and educates the patient, family, and caregivers about wound care, signs and symptoms to report, stress reduction, and the importance of keeping appointments with the primary provider.</p>
