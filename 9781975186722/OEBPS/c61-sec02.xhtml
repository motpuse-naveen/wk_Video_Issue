<p class="nonindent">The rigid cranial vault contains brain tissue (1400 g), blood (75 mL), and CSF (75 mL). The volume and pressure of these three components are usually in a state of equilibrium and produce the ICP. ICP is usually measured in the lateral ventricles, with the normal pressure being 0 to 10 mm Hg, and 15&#x00A0;mm Hg being the upper limit of normal (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Monro&#x2013;Kellie hypothesis:&lt;/b&gt; theory that states that due to limited space for expansion within the skull, an increase in any one of the cranial contents&#x2014;brain tissue, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#x2014;causes a change in the volume of the others (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; Monro&#x2013;Kellie doctrine)">Monro&#x2013;Kellie hypothesis</button></strong>, also known as the Monro&#x2013;Kellie doctrine, explains the dynamic equilibrium of cranial contents. The hypothesis states that because of the limited space for expansion within the skull, an increase in any one of the components causes a change in the volume of the others (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Witherspoon &#x0026; Ashby, 2017</a>). Because brain tissue has limited space to expand, compensation typically is accomplished by displacing or shifting CSF, increasing the absorption or diminishing the production of CSF, or decreasing cerebral blood volume. Without such changes, ICP begins to rise. Under normal circumstances, minor changes in blood volume and CSF volume occur constantly as a result of alterations in intrathoracic pressure (coughing, sneezing, straining), posture, blood pressure, and systemic oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2940">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Increased ICP affects many patients with acute neurologic conditions because pathologic conditions alter the relationship between intracranial volume and ICP. Although elevated ICP is most commonly associated with head injury, it also may be seen as a secondary effect in other conditions, such as brain tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and toxic and viral encephalopathies. Increased ICP from any cause decreases cerebral perfusion, stimulates further edema (swelling), and may shift brain tissue, resulting in herniation&#x2014;a dire and frequently fatal event.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Decreased Cerebral Blood Flow</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Increased ICP may reduce cerebral blood flow, resulting in ischemia and cell death. In the early stages of cerebral ischemia, the vasomotor centers are stimulated and the systemic pressure rises to maintain cerebral blood flow. Usually, this is accompanied by a slow bounding pulse and respiratory irregularities. These changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration are important clinically because they suggest increased ICP.</p>
<p class="indent">The concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood and in the brain tissue also plays a role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow. An increase in the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) causes cerebral vasodilation, leading to increased cerebral blood flow and increased ICP. A decrease in PaCO<sub>2</sub> has a vasoconstrictive effect, limiting blood flow to the brain. Decreased venous outflow may also increase cerebral blood volume, thus raising ICP.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cerebral Edema</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cerebral edema or swelling is defined as an abnormal accumulation of water or fluid in the intracellular space, extracellular space, or both, associated with an increase in the volume of brain tissue. Edema can occur in the gray, white, or interstitial matter. As brain tissue swells within the rigid skull, several mechanisms attempt to compensate for the increasing ICP. These compensatory mechanisms include autoregulation as well as decreased production and flow of CSF. <strong>Autoregulation</strong> refers to the brain&#x2019;s ability to change the diameter of its blood vessels to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow during alterations in systemic blood pressure. This mechanism can be impaired in patients who are experiencing a pathologic and sustained increase in ICP.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cerebral Response to Increased Intracranial Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As ICP rises, compensatory mechanisms in the brain work to maintain blood flow and prevent tissue damage. The brain can maintain a steady perfusion pressure if the arterial systolic blood pressure is 50 to 150 mm Hg and the ICP is less than 40 mm Hg. Changes in ICP are closely linked with cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The CPP is calculated by subtracting the ICP from the mean arterial pressure (MAP). For example, if the MAP is 100 mm&#x00A0;Hg and the ICP is 15 mm Hg, then the CPP is 85 mm Hg. The normal CPP is 70 to 100 mm Hg (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). As ICP rises and the autoregulatory mechanism of the brain is overwhelmed, the CPP can increase to greater than 100 mm Hg or decrease to less than 50 mm Hg. Patients with a CPP of less than 50 mm Hg experience irreversible neurologic damage. Therefore, the CPP must be maintained at 70 to 80 mm Hg to ensure adequate blood flow to the brain. If ICP is equal to MAP, cerebral circulation ceases.</p>
<p class="indent">A clinical phenomenon known as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Cushing&#x2019;s response:&lt;/b&gt; the brain&#x2019;s attempt to restore blood flow by increasing arterial pressure to overcome the increased intracranial pressure (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; Cushing&#x2019;s reflex)">Cushing&#x2019;s response</button></strong> (also called Cushing&#x2019;s reflex) is seen when cerebral blood flow decreases significantly. When ischemic, the vasomotor center triggers an increase in arterial pressure in an effort to overcome the increased ICP. A sympathetically mediated response causes an increase in the systolic blood pressure with a widening of the pulse pressure and cardiac slowing. This response is seen clinically as an increase in systolic blood pressure, widening of the pulse pressure, and reflex slowing of the heart rate. It is a late sign requiring immediate intervention; however, perfusion may be recoverable if the Cushing&#x2019;s response is treated rapidly.</p>
<p class="indent">At a certain point, the brain&#x2019;s ability to autoregulate becomes ineffective and decompensation (ischemia and infarction) begins. When this occurs, the patient exhibits significant changes in mental status and vital signs. The bradycardia, hypertension, and bradypnea associated with this deterioration are known as Cushing&#x2019;s triad, which is a grave sign. At this point, herniation of the brain stem and occlusion of the cerebral blood flow occur if therapeutic intervention is not initiated. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;herniation:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal protrusion of tissue through a defect or natural opening">Herniation</button></strong> refers to the shifting of brain tissue from an area of high pressure to an area of lower pressure (see <a href="#ff61-2">Fig. 61-2</a>). The herniated tissue exerts pressure on the brain area into which it has shifted, which interferes with the blood supply in that area. Cessation of cerebral blood flow results in cerebral ischemia, infarction, and brain death.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2941">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If ICP increases to the point at which the brain&#x2019;s ability to adjust has reached its limits, neural function is impaired; this may be manifested at first by clinical changes in LOC and later by abnormal respiratory and vasomotor responses.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The earliest sign of increasing ICP is a change in LOC. Agitation, slowing of speech, and delay in response to verbal suggestions may be early indicators.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Any sudden change in the patient&#x2019;s condition, such as restlessness (without apparent cause), confusion, or increasing drowsiness, has neurologic significance. These signs may result from compression of the brain due to swelling from hemorrhage or edema, an expanding intracranial lesion (hematoma or tumor), or a combination of both.</p>
<p class="indent">As ICP increases, the patient becomes stuporous, reacting only to loud or painful stimuli. At this stage, serious impairment of brain circulation is probably taking place, and immediate intervention is required. As neurologic function deteriorates further, the patient becomes comatose and exhibits abnormal motor responses in the form of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;decortication:&lt;/b&gt; an abnormal posture associated with severe brain injury, characterized by abnormal flexion of the upper extremities and extension of the lower extremities">decortication</button></strong> (abnormal flexion of the upper extremities and extension of the lower extremities), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;decerebration:&lt;/b&gt; an abnormal body posture associated with severe brain injury, characterized by extreme extension of the upper and lower extremities">decerebration</button></strong> (extreme extension of the upper and lower extremities), or flaccidity (see <a href="c61-sec01.xhtml#ff61-1">Fig. 61-1</a>). If the coma is profound and irreversible with no known confounding factors, brain stem reflexes are absent, and respirations are impaired or absent, the patient may be evaluated for brain death (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Milliken &#x0026; Uveges, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2942">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnostic studies used to determine the underlying cause of increased ICP are discussed in detail in <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>. The most common diagnostic tests are CT scanning and MRI. The patient may also undergo cerebral angiography, PET, or SPECT. Transcranial Doppler studies provide information about cerebral blood flow. The patient with increased ICP may also undergo electrophysiologic monitoring to observe cerebral blood flow indirectly. Evoked potential monitoring measures the electrical potentials produced by nerve tissue in response to external stimulation (auditory, visual, or sensory). Lumbar puncture is avoided in patients with increased ICP, because the sudden release of pressure in the lumbar area can cause the brain to herniate (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). See <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a> for further discussion of lumbar puncture and other diagnostic tests.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2943">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of increased ICP include brain stem herniation, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).</p>
<p class="indent">Brain stem herniation results from an excessive increase in ICP in which the pressure builds in the cranial vault and the brain tissue presses down on the brain stem. This increasing pressure on the brain stem results in cessation of blood flow to the brain, leading to irreversible brain anoxia and brain death.</p>
<p class="indent">Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is the result of decreased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The patient has excessive urine output, decreased urine osmolality, and serum hyperosmolarity (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Tudor &#x0026; Thompson, 2019</a>). Therapy consists of administration of fluids, electrolyte replacement, and administration of a synthetic vasopressin (desmopressin). See <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapters 10</a> and <a href="c45.xhtml">45</a> for a discussion of diabetes insipidus.</p>
<p class="indent">SIADH is the result of increased secretion of ADH. The patient becomes volume overloaded, urine output diminishes, and serum sodium concentration becomes dilute. Treatment of SIADH includes fluid restriction (less than 800 mL/day with no free water), which is usually sufficient to correct the hyponatremia. In severe cases, careful administration of a 3% hypertonic saline solution may be therapeutic (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The change in serum sodium concentration should not exceed a correction rate of approximately 1.3 mEq/L/h. See <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapters 10</a> and <a href="c45.xhtml">45</a> for further discussion of SIADH.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2944">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Increased ICP is a true emergency and must be treated promptly. Invasive monitoring of ICP is an important component of management. Immediate management to relieve increased ICP requires decreasing cerebral edema, lowering <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2002" title="2002"></span>the volume of CSF, or decreasing cerebral blood volume while maintaining cerebral perfusion. These goals are accomplished by administering osmotic diuretics, restricting fluids, draining CSF, controlling fever, maintaining systemic blood pressure and oxygenation, and reducing cellular metabolic demands. See <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a> for a discussion of the management of increased ICP.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Oxygenation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The purposes of ICP monitoring are to identify increased pressure early in its course (before cerebral damage occurs), to quantify the degree of elevation, to initiate appropriate treatment, to provide access to CSF for sampling and drainage, and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. ICP can be monitored with the use of an intraventricular catheter (ventriculostomy), a subarachnoid bolt, an epidural or subdural catheter, or a fiberoptic transducer&#x2013;tipped catheter placed in the subdural space or in the ventricle (see <a href="#ff61-3">Fig. 61-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When a ventriculostomy or intraventricular catheter monitoring device is used for monitoring ICP, a fine-bore catheter is inserted into a lateral ventricle, preferably in the nondominant hemisphere of the brain (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The catheter is connected by a fluid-filled system to a transducer, which records the pressure in the form of an electrical impulse. In addition to obtaining continuous ICP recordings, the ventricular catheter allows CSF to drain, particularly during acute increases in pressure. The ventriculostomy can also be used to drain blood from the ventricle. Continuous drainage of CSF under pressure control is an effective method of treating intracranial hypertension. Another advantage of a ventricular catheter is access for the intraventricular administration of medications and the occasional instillation of air or a contrast agent for ventriculography. Complications associated with its use include infection, meningitis, ventricular collapse, occlusion of the catheter by brain tissue or blood, and problems with the monitoring system.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff61-3">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff61-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff61-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;61-3 &#x2022;</span> Intracranial pressure monitoring. A device may be placed in the ventricle (<strong>A</strong>), the subarachnoid space (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B</button></strong>), the intraparenchymal space (<strong>C</strong>), or the subdural space (<strong>D</strong>).</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The subarachnoid screw or bolt is a hollow device that is inserted through the skull and dura mater into the cranial subarachnoid space (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). It has the advantage of not requiring a ventricular puncture. The subarachnoid screw is attached to a pressure transducer, and the output is recorded on an oscilloscope. The hollow screw technique also has the advantage of avoiding complications from brain shift and small ventricle size. Complications include infection and blockage of the screw by clot or brain tissue, which leads to a loss of pressure tracing and a decrease in accuracy at high ICP readings.</p>
<p class="indent">An epidural monitor uses a pneumatic flow sensor to detect ICP. The epidural ICP monitoring system has a low incidence of infection and complications and appears to read pressures accurately. Calibration of the system is maintained automatically, and abnormal pressure waves trigger an alarm system. One disadvantage of the epidural catheter is the inability to withdraw CSF for analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">A fiberoptic monitor, or transducer-tipped catheter, is an alternative to other intraventricular, subarachnoid, and subdural systems (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4308">Al-Mufti, Smith, Lander, et al., 2018</a>). The miniature transducer reflects pressure changes, which are converted to electrical signals in an amplifier and displayed on a digital monitor. The catheter can be inserted into the ventricle, subarachnoid space, subdural space, or brain parenchyma or under a bone flap. If inserted into the ventricle, it can also be used in conjunction with a CSF drainage device.</p>
<p class="h7">Interpreting Intracranial Pressure Waveforms</p>
<p class="nonindent">Waves of high pressure and troughs of relatively normal pressure indicate changes in ICP. Waveforms are captured and recorded on an oscilloscope. These waves have been classified as A waves (plateau waves), B waves, and C waves (see Fig.&#x00A0;61-4). The plateau waves (A waves) are transient, paroxysmal, recurring elevations of ICP that may last 5 to 20 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2003" title="2003"></span>minutes and range in amplitude from 40 to 100 mm Hg (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Al-Mufti et al., 2018</a>). Plateau waves have clinical significance and indicate changes in vascular volume within the intracranial compartment that are beginning to compromise cerebral perfusion. The A waves may increase in amplitude and frequency, reflecting cerebral ischemia and brain damage that can occur before overt signs and symptoms of raised ICP are seen clinically. B waves are shorter (30 seconds to 2 minutes) and have smaller amplitude (up to 50 mm Hg). They have less clinical significance, but if seen in a series in a patient with depressed consciousness, they may precede the appearance of A waves. B waves may be seen in patients with intracranial hypertension and decreased intracranial compliance. C waves are small, rhythmic oscillations with frequencies of 4 to 8 per minute and appear to be related to rhythmic variations of the systemic arterial blood pressure and respirations (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

Composite diagram of A (plateau) waves, which indicate cerebral ischemia; B waves, which indicate intracranial hypertension and variations in the respiratory cycle; and C waves, which relate to variations in systemic arterial pressure and respirations.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Other Neurologic Monitoring Systems</p>
<p class="nonindent">Another trend in neurologic monitoring is microdialysis of the patient with a brain injury (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Zhou &#x0026; Kalanuria, 2018</a>). Cortical probes are placed near the injured area and are used to measure levels of glutamate, lactate, pyruvate, and glucose, substances that reflect the metabolic function of the brain. Some researchers theorize that direct measurements of glucose and energy by-products in the brain will lead to better management of these patients. Although cerebral microdialysis has reduced the mortality of patients who are brain injured, more study is needed to link it to improved outcomes (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Zhou &#x0026; Kalanuria, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An additional trend is monitoring of cerebral oxygenation through monitoring of the oxygen saturation in the jugular venous bulb (SjvO<sub>2</sub>) or via a catheter in the brain. Cerebral oxygenation is thought to be important because changes in cerebral perfusion may reflect an increase in ICP. Readings taken from a catheter residing in the jugular outflow tract allow for a comparison of arterial and venous oxygen saturation, and the balance of cerebral oxygen supply and demand is demonstrated. Venous jugular desaturations can reflect early cerebral ischemia, alerting the clinician before an increase in ICP occurs. Minimizing cerebral desaturations can potentially improve outcomes. This type of monitoring is now widely available and has been successfully used to identify secondary brain insults. A limiting factor is that this saturation reflects overall perfusion of the brain rather than that of a specific injured area (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Al-Mufti et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another method of measuring cerebral oxygenation and temperature is by inserting a fiberoptic catheter into the brain matter. The most common system is Licox (see <a href="#ff61-5">Fig. 61-5</a>). The system includes a monitor with a screen for the display of oxygen and temperature values and cables that connect to the monitoring probes in the brain (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Decreasing Cerebral Edema</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Osmotic diuretics such as mannitol and hypertonic saline (3%) may be administered to decrease fluid in the brain tissue and reduce cerebral edema (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Witherspoon &#x0026; Ashby, 2017</a>). These agents act by drawing water across intact membranes, thereby reducing the volume of the brain and extracellular fluid. An indwelling urinary catheter is usually inserted to monitor urinary output and to manage the resulting diuresis. If the patient is receiving osmotic diuretics, serum osmolality and electrolytes should be determined to assess hydration status. If a brain tumor is the cause of the increased ICP, corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) help reduce the edema surrounding the tumor.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff61-5">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff61-5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff61-5.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;61-5 &#x2022;</span> The Licox brain tissue oxygen monitor. Permission granted by Integra LifeSciences Corporation, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Another method for decreasing cerebral edema is fluid restriction (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Limiting overall fluid intake leads to dehydration and hemoconcentration, which draws fluid across the osmotic gradient and decreases cerebral edema. Conversely, overhydration of the patient with increased ICP is avoided, because it increases cerebral edema.</p>
<p class="indent">Researchers have long hypothesized that lowering body temperature would decrease cerebral edema by reducing the oxygen and metabolic requirements of the brain, thus protecting the brain from continued ischemia. If body metabolism can be reduced by lowering the body temperature, the collateral circulation in the brain may be able to provide an adequate blood supply to the brain. The effect of hypothermia on ICP requires more study; thus far, induced hypothermia has not consistently been shown to be beneficial for patients with brain injury. Inducing and maintaining hypothermia is a major clinical treatment and requires knowledge and skilled nursing observation and management. The type and length of rewarming techniques after hypothermia may also be factors in the outcome of patients with neurologic injuries (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rincon, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Cerebral Perfusion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac output may be manipulated to provide adequate perfusion to the brain. Improvements in cardiac output are made using fluid volume and inotropic agents such as dobutamine and norepinephrine. The effectiveness of the cardiac <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2004" title="2004"></span>output is reflected in the CPP, which is maintained at greater than 70 mm Hg. A lower CPP indicates that the cardiac output is insufficient to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion. SjvO<sub>2</sub> and Licox, described earlier, assist in monitoring cerebral perfusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Decompressive hemicraniectomy may also be considered as a surgical strategy to assist in the management of refractory intracranial hypertension. The removal of a part of the skull allows the brain to expand without the pressure constraints exerted by the cranial vault. Complications of this procedure include infection and increased potential for injury to the unprotected underlying brain structures. Once the patient is no longer at risk for increased ICP, the bone flap may be surgically replaced (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4320">Hutchinson, Kolias, Tajsic, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Cerebrospinal Fluid and Intracranial Blood Volume</h6>
<p class="nonindent">CSF drainage is frequently performed, because the removal of CSF with a ventriculostomy drain can dramatically reduce ICP and restore CPP. Caution should be used in draining CSF, however, because excessive drainage may result in collapse of the ventricles and herniation. The reduction in PaCO<sub>2</sub> may result in hypoxia, ischemia, and an increase in cerebral lactate levels. Maintaining the PaCO<sub>2</sub> at greater than 30 mm Hg may prove beneficial (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Controlling Fever</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preventing a temperature elevation is critical, because fever increases cerebral metabolism and the rate at which cerebral edema forms. Strategies to reduce body temperature include administration of antipyretic medications, as prescribed, and the use of a hypothermia blanket. Additional strategies for reducing fever were discussed previously in the Nursing Process section on altered LOC. The patient&#x2019;s temperature is monitored closely, and the patient is observed for shivering, which should be avoided because it is associated with increased oxygen consumption, increased levels of circulating catecholamines, and increased vasoconstriction. Shivering is associated with decreased levels of brain oxygenation; however, the association between shivering and neurologic outcome is unknown.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Oxygenation and Reducing Metabolic Demands</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial blood gases and pulse oximetry are monitored to ensure that systemic oxygenation remains optimal. Metabolic demands may be reduced through the administration of high doses of barbiturates if the patient is unresponsive to conventional treatment. The mechanism by which barbiturates decrease ICP and protect the brain is uncertain, but the resultant comatose state is thought to reduce the metabolic requirements of the brain, thus providing cerebral protection.</p>
<p class="indent">Another method of reducing cellular metabolic demand and improving oxygenation is the administration of medications causing sedation. The patient who receives these agents cannot move; this decreases the metabolic demands and results in a decrease in cerebral oxygen demand. The patient cannot respond to or report pain either. The most common agents used for sedation are pentobarbital, thiopental, propofol, and dexmedetomidine (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4329">Opdenakker, Vanstraelen, De Sloovere, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If sedative agents are used, the ability to perform serial neurologic assessments is lost. Therefore, other monitoring tools are needed to assess the patient&#x2019;s status and response to therapy. Important parameters that must be assessed include ICP, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and the patient&#x2019;s response to ventilator therapy (e.g., patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). The level of pharmacologic paralysis is adjusted based on serum levels of the medications given and the assessed parameters. Potential complications of these medications include hypotension caused by decreased sympathetic tone and myocardial depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients receiving high doses of barbiturates or pharmacologic sedatives require continuous cardiac monitoring, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and arterial pressure monitoring, as well as ICP monitoring.</p>

<p class="processppara">Initial assessment of the patient with increased ICP includes obtaining a history of events leading to the present illness and the pertinent past medical history. It is usually necessary to obtain this information from family or friends. The neurologic examination should be as complete as the patient&#x2019;s condition allows. It includes an evaluation of mental status, LOC, cranial nerve function, cerebellar function (balance and coordination), reflexes, and motor and sensory function. Because the patient is critically ill, ongoing assessment is more focused, including pupil checks, assessment of selected cranial nerves, frequent measurements of vital signs and ICP, and the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale (see <a href="c61-sec01.xhtml#tt61-1">Table 61-1</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient include normalization of respiration, adequate cerebral tissue perfusion through reduction in ICP, restoration of fluid balance, absence of infection, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<span class="small">CHIEVING AN</span> A<span class="small">DEQUATE</span> B<span class="small">REATHING</span> P<span class="small">ATTERN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">In order to normalize breathing it is essential to maintain the airway. The patency of the airway is assessed. Secretions that are obstructing the airway must be suctioned with care, because transient elevations of ICP occur with suctioning (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Hypoxia caused by poor oxygenation leads to cerebral ischemia and edema. Coughing is discouraged because it increases ICP. The lung fields are auscultated at least every 8 hours to determine the presence of adventitious sounds or any areas of congestion. Elevating the head of the bed may aid in clearing secretions and improve venous drainage of the brain.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient must be monitored for respiratory irregularities. Increased pressure on the frontal lobes or deep midline structures may result in Cheyne&#x2013;Stokes respirations, whereas pressure in the midbrain can cause hyperventilation. If the lower portion of the brain stem (the pons and medulla) is involved, respirations become irregular and eventually cease.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">There is ongoing controversy about the use of hyperventilation therapy in traumatic brain injury. This therapy is used in some circumstances to reduce ICP by causing cerebral vasoconstriction and a decrease in cerebral blood volume. The nurse collaborates with the respiratory therapist in monitoring the PaCO<sub>2</sub>, which is usually maintained at less than 30 mm Hg. Employing hyperventilation should follow guidelines for management of TBI as it involves risk of cerebral vasoconstriction and ischemia (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4333">Saherwala, Bader, Stutzman, et al., 2018</a>). Patients undergoing hyperventilation therapy also benefit from multimodality monitoring to determine the overall effect of this therapy on brain perfusion (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A neurologic observation record (see <a href="#ff61-6">Fig. 61-6</a>) is maintained, and all observations are made in relation to the patient&#x2019;s baseline condition. Repeated assessments of the patient are made (sometimes minute by minute) so that improvement or deterioration may be noted immediately. If the patient&#x2019;s condition deteriorates, the primary provider is notified emergently and preparations are made for surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>O<span class="small">PTIMIZING</span> C<span class="small">EREBRAL</span> T<span class="small">ISSUE</span> P<span class="small">ERFUSION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">In addition to ongoing nursing assessment, strategies are initiated to reduce factors contributing to the elevation of ICP (see <a href="#tt61-2">Table 61-2</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Proper positioning helps reduce ICP. The patient&#x2019;s head is kept in a neutral (midline) position, maintained with the use of a cervical collar if necessary, to promote venous drainage. Elevation of the head is maintained at 30 to 45 degrees unless contraindicated. Extreme rotation of the neck and flexion of the neck are avoided, because compression or distortion of the jugular veins increases ICP. Extreme hip flexion is also avoided, because this position causes an increase in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures, which can produce an increase in ICP. Relatively minor changes in position can significantly affect ICP. If monitoring reveals that turning the patient raises ICP, rotating beds, turning sheets, and holding the patient&#x2019;s head during turning may minimize the stimuli that increase ICP. Research suggests that patient response to position change is highly variable and requires close hemodynamic monitoring and individualized care (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The Valsalva maneuver, which can be produced by straining at defecation or even moving in bed, raises ICP and is to be avoided. Stool softeners may be prescribed. If the patient is alert and able to eat, a diet high in fiber may be indicated. Abdominal distention, which increases intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure and ICP, should be noted. Enemas and cathartics are avoided if possible. When moving or being turned in bed, the patient can be instructed to exhale (which opens the glottis) to avoid the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Mechanical ventilation presents unique problems for the patient with increased ICP. Before suctioning, the patient should be preoxygenated and briefly hyperventilated using 100% oxygen on the ventilator. Suctioning should not last longer than 15 seconds. High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) must be utilized cautiously, because they may decrease venous return to the heart and decrease venous drainage from the brain through increased intrathoracic pressure (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Activities that increase ICP, as indicated by changes in waveforms, should be avoided if possible. Spacing of nursing interventions may prevent transient increases in ICP. During nursing interventions, the ICP should not increase above 25&#x00A0;mm Hg, and it should return to baseline levels within 5&#x00A0;minutes. Patients with increased ICP should not demonstrate a significant increase in pressure or change in the ICP waveform. Patients with the potential for a significant increase in ICP may need sedation before initiation of nursing activities (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Emotional stress and frequent arousal from sleep are avoided. A calm atmosphere is maintained. Environmental stimuli (e.g., noise, conversation) should be minimal.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">AINTAINING</span> N<span class="small">EGATIVE</span> F<span class="small">LUID</span> B<span class="small">ALANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The administration of osmotic and loop diuretics is part of the treatment protocol to reduce ICP. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce cerebral edema (except when it results from trauma), and fluids may be restricted. All of these treatment modalities promote dehydration.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Skin turgor, mucous membranes, urine output, and serum and urine osmolality are monitored to assess fluid status. If IV fluids are prescribed, the nurse ensures that they are given at a slow to moderate rate with an IV infusion pump, to prevent too-rapid administration and avoid overhydration. For the patient receiving mannitol, the nurse observes for the possible development of heart failure and pulmonary edema. The intent of treatment is to promote a shift of fluid from the intracellular to the intravascular compartment and to control cerebral edema. However, this shift of fluid volume to the intravascular compartment may overwhelm the ability of the myocardium to increase workload sufficient to meet these demands, which may cause failure and pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For patients undergoing dehydrating procedures, vital signs, including blood pressure, must be monitored to assess fluid volume status. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to permit assessment of renal function and fluid status. During the acute phase, urine output is monitored hourly. An output greater than 200 mL/h for 2 consecutive hours may indicate the onset of diabetes insipidus (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). These patients need careful oral hygiene, because mouth dryness occurs with dehydration. Frequently rinsing the mouth with nondrying solutions, lubricating the lips, and removing encrustations relieve dryness and promote comfort.</p>

<p class="processppara">The risk of infection is greatest when ICP is monitored with an intraventricular catheter and increases with the duration of the monitoring. Most health care facilities have written protocols for managing these systems and maintaining their sterility; strict adherence to the protocols is essential.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Aseptic technique must be used when managing the system and changing the ventricular drainage bag. The drainage system is also checked for loose connections, because they can cause leakage and contamination of the CSF as well as inaccurate readings of ICP. The nurse observes the character of the CSF drainage and reports increasing cloudiness or blood. The patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of meningitis: fever, chills, nuchal (neck) rigidity, and increasing or persistent headache. See <a href="c64.xhtml">Chapter 64</a> for a discussion of meningitis.</p>

<p class="processppara">The primary complication of increased ICP is brain herniation resulting in death (see <a href="#ff61-2">Fig. 61-2</a>). Nursing management focuses on detecting early signs of increasing ICP, because medical interventions are usually ineffective once later signs develop (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Frequent neurologic assessments and documentation and analysis of trends will reveal the subtle changes that may indicate increasing ICP.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Detecting Indications of Increasing Intracranial Pressure.</span> The nurse assesses for and immediately reports any signs or symptoms of increasing ICP (see <a href="#ct61-1">Chart 61-1</a>). The focus is on detecting early signs of increasing ICP.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Monitoring Intracranial Pressure.</span> Because clinical assessment is not always a reliable guide in recognizing increased ICP, especially in patients who are comatose, monitoring of ICP and cerebral oxygenation is an essential part of management. ICP is monitored closely for continuous elevation or significant increase over baseline. The trend of ICP measurements over time is an important indication of the patient&#x2019;s underlying status. Vital signs are assessed when an increase in ICP is noted (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Careful attention to aseptic technique is needed when handling any part of the monitoring system (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The insertion site is inspected for signs of infection. Temperature, pulse, and respirations are closely monitored for systemic signs of infection (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Rincon, 2018</a>). All connections and stopcocks are checked for leaks, because even small leaks can distort pressure readings and lead to infection (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When ICP is monitored with a fluid system, the transducer is calibrated at a particular reference point, usually 2.5 cm (1 inch) above the ear with the patient in the supine position; this point corresponds to the level of the foramen of Monro (see <a href="#ff61-7">Fig. 61-7</a>). CSF pressure readings depend on the patient&#x2019;s position. For subsequent pressure readings, the head should be in the same position relative to the transducer. Fiberoptic catheters are calibrated before insertion and do not require further referencing; they do not require the head of the bed to be at a specific position to obtain an accurate reading.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">When technology is associated with patient management, the nurse must be certain that the technologic equipment is functioning properly and used correctly (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4323">Liu, Griffith, Jang, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in Chart&#x00A0;61-2). The most important concern must be the patient to whom equipment is attached. The patient and family must be informed about the technology and the goals of its use. The patient&#x2019;s response is monitored, and appropriate comfort measures are implemented to ensure that the patient&#x2019;s stress is minimized.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">ICP measurement is only one parameter; repeated neurologic checks and clinical examinations remain important measures. Astute observation, comparison of findings with previous observations, and interventions can assist in preventing life-threatening ICP elevations.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Monitoring for secondary complications.</span> The nurse also assesses for complications of increased ICP, including diabetes insipidus and SIADH (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapters 10</a> and <a href="c45.xhtml">45</a>). Urine output should be monitored closely. Diabetes insipidus requires fluid and electrolyte replacement, along with the administration of vasopressin, to replace and slow the urine output.

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study of intracranial pressure (ICP) recordings was to obtain an insight into how well the intermittent external ventricular drain (EVD) clamping procedure is performed for ICP documentation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a retrospective analysis of ICP recordings. For each recording of ICP, the mean and standard deviation were calculated. The duration of EVD closure, time interval between two adjacent EVD closures, and the total number of EVD closures were calculated for each patient. An algorithm to evaluate whether ICP reached a new equilibrium before the EVD was reopened for drainage was developed. The percentage of EVD closures that reached the equilibrium was calculated.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Data were obtained from 107 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who had 32,755 EVD closures in total. Only 65.9% of openings lasted less than 1 minute and 16.3% lasted longer than 5 minutes. The median duration of each EVD closure was 25 seconds. Only 22.9% of EVD closures reached ICP equilibrium before EVD reopening.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This research provides evidence for the need to properly train and provide a standard guideline for bedside nurses to correctly obtain and document ICP. Nurses working in settings where ICP is monitored need to work on clear guidelines that specify the need to wait the required time when opening and closing an EVD in order to get an accurate reading.</p>
