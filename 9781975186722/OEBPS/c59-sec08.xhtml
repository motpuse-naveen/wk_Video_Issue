<h4 class="h4" id="s2870">Malignant External Otitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A more serious, although rare, external ear infection is malignant external otitis (temporal bone osteomyelitis). This is a progressive, debilitating, and occasionally fatal infection of the external auditory canal, the surrounding tissue, and the base of the skull. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is usually the infecting organism in patients with low resistance to infection (e.g., patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Successful treatment includes administration of antibiotics (usually intravenously [IV]) and aggressive local wound care.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1948" title="1948"></span> Standard parenteral antibiotic treatment includes the combination of an antipseudomonal agent and an aminoglycoside, both of which have potentially serious side effects. Because aminoglycosides are nephrotoxic and ototoxic, serum aminoglycoside levels and kidney and auditory function must be monitored during therapy. Local wound care includes limited d&#x00E9;bridement of the infected tissue, including bone and cartilage, depending on the extent of the infection.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Prevention of Otitis Externa</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>protect the external canal when swimming, showering, or washing hair. Use ear plugs or place a cotton ball covered in petrolatum jelly in the ear, and wear a swim cap. The external canal may be dried afterward with a hair dryer on low heat.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>place alcohol drops in the external canal to act as an astringent to help prevent infection after water exposure.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>prevent trauma to the external canal. Procedures, foreign objects (e.g., bobby pin), scratching, or any other trauma to the canal that breaks the skin integrity may cause infection.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>be aware that if otitis externa is diagnosed, refrain from any water sport activity for approximately 7 to 10 days to allow the canal to heal completely. Recurrence is highly likely unless you allow the external canal to heal completely.</p>
