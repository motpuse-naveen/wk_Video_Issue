<h4 class="h4" id="s2061">Diabetic Neuropathies</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetic neuropathy refers to a group of diseases that affect all types of nerves, including peripheral (sensorimotor), autonomic, and spinal nerves. The disorders appear to be clinically diverse and depend on the location of the affected nerve cells. The prevalence increases with the age of the patient and the duration of the disease (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3464">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The etiology of neuropathy may involve elevated blood glucose levels over a period of years. Control of blood glucose levels to normal or near-normal levels decreases the incidence of neuropathy. The pathogenesis of neuropathy may be attributed to either a vascular or metabolic mechanism or both. Capillary basement membrane thickening and capillary closure may be present. In addition, there may be demyelinization of the nerves, which is thought to be related to hyperglycemia. Nerve conduction is disrupted when there are aberrations of the myelin sheaths.</p>
<p class="indent">The two most common types of diabetic neuropathy are sensorimotor polyneuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is also called <em>peripheral neuropathy.</em> Cranial mononeuropathies&#x2014;those affecting the oculomotor nerve&#x2014;also occur in diabetes, especially in older adults.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2062">Peripheral Neuropathy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Peripheral neuropathy most commonly affects the distal portions of the nerves, especially the nerves of the lower extremities; it affects both sides of the body symmetrically and may spread in a proximal direction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2063">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although approximately half of patients with diabetic neuropathy do not have symptoms, initial symptoms may include paresthesias (prickling, tingling, or heightened sensation) and burning sensations (especially at night). As the neuropathy progresses, the feet become numb. In addition, a decrease in proprioception (awareness of posture and movement of the body and of position and weight of objects in relation to the body) and a decreased sensation of light touch may lead to an unsteady gait. Decreased sensations of pain and temperature place patients with neuropathy at increased risk for injury due to falls and undetected foot infections (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Deformities of the foot may also occur; neuropathy-related joint changes are sometimes referred to as Charcot joints. These joint deformities result from the abnormal weight distribution on joints resulting from lack of proprioception.</p>
<p class="indent">On physical examination, a decrease in deep tendon reflexes and vibratory sensation is found. For patients with fewer or no symptoms of neuropathy, these physical findings may be the only indication of neuropathic changes. For patients with signs or symptoms of neuropathy, it is important to rule out other possible causes, including alcohol-induced and vitamin-deficiency neuropathies.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2064">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Intensive insulin therapy and control of blood glucose levels delay the onset and slow the progression of neuropathy. Pain, particularly of the lower extremities, is a disturbing symptom in some people with neuropathy secondary to diabetes. In some cases, neuropathic pain spontaneously resolves within 6 months; for others, pain persists for many years. Various approaches to pain management can be tried. These include analgesic agents (preferably nonopioid); tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressant medications (duloxetine); anticonvulsant medications (pregabalin or gabapentin); mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic agent; and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2065">Autonomic Neuropathies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neuropathy of the autonomic nervous system results in a broad range of dysfunctions affecting almost every organ system of the body (NIDDK, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2066">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Three manifestations of autonomic neuropathy are related to the cardiac, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. Cardiovascular symptoms range from a fixed, slightly tachycardic heart rate and orthostatic hypotension to silent, or painless, myocardial ischemia and infarction. Research suggests that cardiovascular health may also be impacted by diabetes distress and depressive symptoms (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3463">McCarthy, Whittemore, Gholson, et al., 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct46-10">Chart 46-10</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Delayed gastric emptying may occur with the typical gastrointestinal symptoms of early satiety, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. &#x201C;Diabetic&#x201D; constipation or diarrhea (especially nocturnal diarrhea) may occur as a result. In addition, there may be unexplained wide swings in blood glucose levels related to inconsistent absorption of the glucose from ingested foods secondary to the inconsistent gastric emptying.</p>
<p class="indent">Urinary retention, a decreased sensation of bladder fullness, and other urinary symptoms of neurogenic bladder result from autonomic neuropathy. The patient with a neurogenic bladder is predisposed to development of urinary tract infections because of the inability to empty the bladder completely. This is especially true of patients with poorly controlled diabetes because hyperglycemia impairs resistance to infection.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hypoglycemic Unawareness</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Autonomic neuropathy affecting the adrenal medulla is responsible for diminished or absent adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients may report that they no longer feel the typical shakiness, sweating, nervousness, and palpitations associated with hypoglycemia. Frequent blood glucose monitoring is recommended for these patients. The inability to detect and treat these warning signs of hypoglycemia puts patients at risk for development of dangerously low blood glucose levels. Therefore, goals for blood glucose levels may need to be adjusted to reduce the risk for hypoglycemia. Patients and families need to be taught to recognize subtle and atypical symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as numbness around the mouth and impaired ability to concentrate.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sudomotor Neuropathy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The neuropathic condition called <em>sudomotor neuropathy</em> refers to a decrease or absence of anhidrosis (sweating) of the extremities, with a compensatory increase in upper body anhidrosis. Dryness of the feet increases the risk for the development of foot ulcerations.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sexual Dysfunction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sexual dysfunction, especially erectile dysfunction in men, is a complication of diabetes. The effects of autonomic neuropathy on female sexual functioning are not well documented. Reduced vaginal lubrication has been mentioned as a possible neuropathic effect. Other possible changes in sexual function in women with diabetes include decreased libido and lack of orgasm. Vaginal infection, which increases in the incidence in women with diabetes, may be associated with decreased lubrication and vaginal pruritus (itching) and tenderness. Urinary tract infections and vaginitis may also affect sexual function.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Health Factors in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">McCarthy, M. M., Whittemore, R., Gholson, G., et al. (2019). Diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, and cardiovascular health in adults with type 1 diabetes. <em>Nursing Research</em>, <em>68</em>(6), 445&#x2013;452.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The prevalence of type 1 diabetes in adults is increasing. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationships among the psychological factors of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress and six cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a cross-sectional survey of a sample of 83 adults with type 1 diabetes. Data were collected about sociodemographic information, depressive symptoms, diabetes distress, and cardiovascular health factors (body mass index [BMI], blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, hemoglobin A1C, and physical activity).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The mean age of participants was 45 years, with a mean duration of 20 years with type 1 diabetes. The majority had low scores on the Diabetes Distress Scale while 18% had moderate, and another 18% had high scores. Twenty-two percent of participants had an increased level of depressive symptoms. Significant correlations were found between diabetes distress and fear of hypoglycemia (<em>r</em> = .65, <em>p</em> &#x003C; .0001), depressive symptoms (<em>r</em> = .55, <em>p</em> &#x003C; .0001), hemoglobin A1C (<em>r</em> = .41, <em>p</em> &#x003C; .001), and total cholesterol (<em>r</em> = .26, <em>p</em> &#x003C; .05). There were significant correlations between depressive symptom scores and fear of hypoglycemia (<em>r</em> = .35, <em>p</em> &#x003C; .01), as well as hemoglobin A1C (<em>r</em> = .25, <em>p</em> &#x003C; .05). There were small to medium nonsignificant correlations between depressive symptoms scores and weekly step counts and BMI.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses working with patients with type 1 diabetes need to be aware that elevated diabetes distress and depressive symptoms may further affect these patients&#x2019; already high risk of cardiovascular disease. Interventions are needed that affect both physical and psychological factors that have the potential to adversely affect cardiovascular health.</p>

<p class="indent">Erectile dysfunction occurs with greater frequency in men with diabetes than in other men of the same age. Some men with autonomic neuropathy have normal erectile function and can experience orgasm but do not ejaculate normally. Retrograde ejaculation occurs; seminal fluid is propelled backward through the posterior urethra and into the urinary bladder. Examination of the urine confirms the diagnosis because of the large number of active sperm present. Fertility counseling may be necessary for couples attempting conception.</p>
<p class="indent">Diabetic neuropathy is not the only cause of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes. Medications such as antihypertensive agents, psychological factors, and other medical conditions (e.g., vascular insufficiency) that may affect other men also play a role in erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes (see <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2067">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management strategies for autonomic neuropathy focus on alleviating symptoms and on modification and management of risk factors. Detection of painless cardiac ischemia is important so that education about avoiding strenuous exercise can be provided. Orthostatic hypotension may respond to a diet high in sodium, discontinuation of medications that impede autonomic nervous system responses, the use of sympathomimetic and other agents (e.g., caffeine) that stimulate an autonomic response, mineralocorticoid therapy, and the use of lower-body elastic garments that maximize venous return and prevent pooling of blood in the extremities.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of delayed gastric emptying includes a low-fat diet, frequent small meals, frequent blood glucose monitoring, and the use of agents that increase gastric motility (e.g., metoclopramide, bethanechol). Treatment of diabetic diarrhea may include bulk-forming laxatives or antidiarrheal agents. Constipation is treated with a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration; medications, laxatives, and enemas may be necessary if constipation is severe. Management of sexual dysfunction in women and men is discussed in Chapters 51 and 53, respectively. Intermittent straight catheterization may be necessary to prevent urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic bladders.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of sudomotor dysfunction focuses on education about skin care and heat intolerance.</p>
