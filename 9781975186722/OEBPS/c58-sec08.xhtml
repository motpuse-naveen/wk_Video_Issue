If left untreated, the increased IOP damages the optic nerve and nerve fiber layer, but the degree of harm is highly variable (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). The optic nerve damage is related to the IOP caused by congestion of aqueous humor in the eye. A range of IOPs are considered &#x201C;normal,&#x201D; but these may also be associated with vision loss in some patients.</p>

<p class="indent">Glaucoma is estimated to affect three million Americans, approximately 50% of whom are undiagnosed (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Moore et al., 2018</a>). Glaucoma is more prevalent in people older than 40&#x00A0;years, and it is the third most common age-related eye disease in the United States. <a href="#ct58-6">Chart 58-6</a> presents the risk factors for glaucoma. There is no cure for glaucoma, but the disease can be controlled (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4179">Glaucoma Research Foundation, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2755">Physiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aqueous humor flows between the iris and the lens, nourishing the cornea and lens. Most (90%) of the fluid then flows out of the anterior chamber, draining through the spongy trabecular meshwork into the canal of Schlemm and the episcleral veins (see <a href="#ff58-6">Fig. 58-6</a>). About 10% of the aqueous fluid exits through the ciliary body into the suprachoroidal space and then drains into the venous circulation of the ciliary body, choroid, and sclera (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>). Unimpeded outflow of aqueous fluid depends on an intact drainage system and an open angle (about 45 degrees) between the iris and the cornea. A narrower angle places the iris closer to the trabecular meshwork, diminishing the angle. The amount of aqueous humor produced tends to decrease with age, in systemic diseases such as diabetes, and in ocular inflammatory conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">IOP is determined by the rate of aqueous production, the resistance encountered by the aqueous humor as it flows out of the passages, and the venous pressure of the episcleral veins that drain into the anterior ciliary vein. When aqueous fluid production and drainage are in balance, the IOP is between 10 and 21 mm Hg. When aqueous fluid is inhibited from flowing out, pressure builds up within the eye. Fluctuations in IOP occur with time of day, exertion, diet, and medications. IOP tends to increase with blinking, tight lid squeezing, and upward gazing. Systemic conditions such as diabetes and intraocular conditions such as uveitis and retinal detachment have been associated with elevated IOP. Glaucoma may not be recognized in people with thin corneas because measurement of the IOP may be falsely low as a result of this thinness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2756">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are two theories regarding how increased IOP damages the optic nerve in glaucoma. The direct mechanical theory suggests that high IOP damages the retinal layer as it passes through the optic nerve head. The indirect ischemic theory suggests that high IOP compresses the microcirculation in the optic nerve head, resulting in cell injury and death. Some glaucomas appear as exclusively mechanical, and some are exclusively ischemic types. Typically, most cases are a combination of both.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2757">Classification of Glaucoma</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are several types of glaucoma. Forms of glaucoma are identified as wide-angle glaucoma; narrow-angle glaucoma; congenital glaucoma; and glaucoma associated with other conditions, such as developmental anomalies or corticosteroid use. Glaucoma can be primary or secondary, depending on whether associated factors contribute to the rise in IOP. The two common clinical forms of glaucoma in adults are wide- and narrow-angle glaucoma, which are differentiated by the mechanisms that cause impaired aqueous outflow (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>). <a href="#tt58-4">Table 58-4</a> summarizes the characteristics of the different types of adult glaucoma.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2758">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Glaucoma is often called the &#x201C;silent thief of sight&#x201D; because most patients are unaware that they have the disease until <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1912" title="1912"></span>they have experienced visual changes and vision loss. The patient may not seek health care until they experience blurred vision or &#x201C;halos&#x201D; around lights, difficulty focusing, difficulty adjusting eyes in low lighting, loss of peripheral vision, aching or discomfort around the eyes, and headache.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2759">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The purpose of a glaucoma workup is to establish the diagnostic category, assess the optic nerve damage, and formulate a treatment plan. The patient&#x2019;s ocular and medical history must be detailed to investigate the history of predisposing factors. The types of examinations used in glaucoma include tonometry to measure the IOP, ophthalmoscopy to inspect the optic nerve, and central visual field testing (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4179">Glaucoma Research Foundation, 2019</a>; <a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The changes in the optic nerve related to glaucoma are pallor and cupping of the optic nerve disc. The pallor of the optic nerve is caused by a lack of blood supply. Cupping is characterized by exaggerated bending of the blood vessels as they cross the optic disc, resulting in an enlarged optic cup that appears more basinlike compared with a normal cup. The progression of cupping in glaucoma is caused by the gradual loss of retinal nerve fibers and the loss of blood supply.</p>
<p class="indent">As the optic nerve damage increases, visual perception decreases. The localized areas of visual loss (i.e., scotomas) represent loss of retinal sensitivity and nerve fiber damage and are measured and mapped on a graph. In patients with glaucoma, the graph has a distinct pattern that is different from other ocular diseases and is useful in establishing the diagnosis. Figure 58-7 shows the visual changes caused by glaucoma.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2760">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The aim of all glaucoma treatment is prevention of optic nerve damage. Lifelong therapy is necessary because glaucoma cannot be cured. Treatment focuses on pharmacologic therapy, laser procedures, surgery, or a combination of these approaches, all of which have potential complications and side effects. The object is to achieve the greatest benefit at the least risk, cost, and inconvenience to the patient. Although treatment cannot reverse optic nerve damage, further damage can be controlled. The goal is to maintain an IOP within a range unlikely to cause further damage (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4198">Sheybani, Scott, Samuelson, et al., 2020</a>). The initial target for IOP among <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1913" title="1913"></span>patients with elevated IOP and those with low-tension glaucoma with progressive visual field loss is typically set at 30% lower than the current pressure. The patient is monitored for changes in the appearance of the optic nerve. If there is evidence of progressive damage, the target IOP is again lowered until the optic nerve shows stability.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of glaucoma relies on systemic and topical ocular medications that lower IOP. Periodic follow-up examinations are essential to monitor IOP, the appearance of the optic nerve, the visual fields, and side effects of medications. Therapy takes into account the patient&#x2019;s health and stage of glaucoma. Comfort, affordability, convenience, lifestyle, and functional ability are factors to consider in the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the medical regimen (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is usually started on the lowest dose of topical medication and then advanced to increased concentrations until the desired IOP level is reached and maintained. Beta-blockers are the preferred initial topical medications because of their efficacy, minimal dosing (can be used once each day), and low cost. One eye is treated first, with the other eye used as a control in determining the efficacy of the medication; once efficacy has been established, treatment of the other eye is started. If the IOP is elevated in both eyes, both are treated. When results are not satisfactory, a new medication is substituted. The main markers of the efficacy of the medication in glaucoma control are lowering of the IOP to the target pressure, stable appearance of the optic nerve head, and the visual field.</p>
<p class="indent">Many ocular medications are used to treat glaucoma (see <a href="#tt58-5">Table 58-5</a>), including miotics, beta-blockers, alpha<sub>2</sub>-agonists (i.e., adrenergic agents), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and prostaglandins. Cholinergics (i.e., miotics) increase the outflow of the aqueous humor by affecting ciliary muscle contraction and pupil constriction, allowing flow through a larger opening between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. Beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease aqueous production. Prostaglandin analogues reduce IOP by increasing aqueous humor outflow (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is reserved for patients in whom pharmacologic treatment has not controlled the IOP. This minimally invasive procedure is specifically designed to improve fluid drainage from the eye to balance IOP. By restoring the eye&#x2019;s natural fluid balance, trabeculectomy surgery stabilizes the optic nerve and minimizes further visual field damage (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Sheybani et al., 2020</a>). The surgery is performed through a small incision and does not require creation of a permanent hole in the eye wall or an external filtering bleb or an implant.</p>
<p class="indent">In laser trabeculoplasty for glaucoma, a laser beam is applied to the inner surface of the trabecular meshwork to open the intratrabecular spaces and widen the canal of Schlemm, promoting outflow of aqueous humor and decreasing IOP. The procedure is indicated when IOP is inadequately controlled by medications, and it is contraindicated when the trabecular meshwork cannot be fully visualized because of a narrow angle.</p>

<p class="indent">In peripheral iridotomy for pupillary block glaucoma, an opening is made in the iris to eliminate the pupillary blockage. Laser iridotomy is contraindicated in patients with corneal edema, which interferes with laser targeting and strength. Potential complications include burns to the cornea, lens, or retina; transient elevated IOP; closure of the iridotomy; uveitis; and blurring.</p>
<p class="indent">Filtering procedures for glaucoma are used to create an opening or fistula in the trabecular meshwork to drain aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space into a bleb (fluid collection on the outside of the eye), thereby bypassing the usual drainage structures. This allows the aqueous humor to flow and exit by different routes (i.e., absorption by the conjunctival vessels or mixing with tears). Trabeculectomy is the standard filtering technique used to remove part of the trabecular meshwork (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Shaw &#x0026; Lee, 2017</a>). Complications include hemorrhage, an extremely low (hypotony) or extremely elevated IOP, uveitis, cataracts, bleb failure, bleb leak, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endophthalmitis:&lt;/b&gt; intraocular infection">endophthalmitis</button></strong> (i.e., intraocular infection).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Drainage implants</em> or <em>shunts</em> are tubes implanted in the anterior chamber to shunt aqueous humor to the episcleral plate in the conjunctival space. Implants are used when failure has occurred with one or more trabeculectomies in which antifibrotic agents were used. A fibrous capsule develops around the episcleral plate and filters the aqueous humor, thereby regulating the outflow and controlling IOP.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Nurses in all settings encounter patients with glaucoma. Even patients with long-standing disease and those with glaucoma as a secondary diagnosis should be assessed for knowledge level and adherence to their prescribed therapeutic regimen.</p>

<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The medical and surgical management of glaucoma slows the progression of the disease but does not cure it. The lifelong therapeutic regimen mandates patient education. The nature of the disease and the importance of strict adherence to the medication regimen must be included in an individualized education plan. A structured self-management program may increase adherence to the treatment regime. A thorough discussion of the medication program, particularly the interactions of glaucoma-control medications with other medications, is essential. For example, the diuretic effect of acetazolamide may have an additive effect on the diuretic effects of other antihypertensive medications (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The effects of glaucoma-control medications on vision must also be explained. Miotics and sympathomimetics result in altered focus; therefore, patients need to be cautious in navigating their surroundings. <a href="#ct58-5">Chart 58-5</a> presents patient education about instilling eye medications and preventing systemic absorption with punctal occlusion. <a href="#ct58-7">Chart 58-7</a> contains additional educational information to review with patients with glaucoma.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with severe glaucoma and impaired function may need referral to home, community-based or transitional services that provide assistance in the home. The loss of peripheral vision impairs mobility the most. These patients also benefit from a referral for low vision and rehabilitation services. Patients who meet the criteria for legal blindness should be offered referrals to agencies that can assist them in obtaining federal assistance.</p>

<p class="indent">Reassurance and emotional support are important aspects of care. A lifelong disease involving possible loss of sight has psychological, physical, social, and vocational ramifications. The family must be integrated into the plan of care, and because the disease has a familial tendency, family members should be encouraged to undergo examinations at least once every 2 years to detect glaucoma early.</p>
