<h4 class="h4" id="s2702">Overview of Burn Injury</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Burn injuries, which result from damage to the skin or other tissues from heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation, most commonly occur in the home or work setting. Globally, they account for approximately 180,000 deaths and significant morbidity each year; however, many are preventable (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4147">World Health Organization [WHO], 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2703">Incidence</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A burn injury can affect people of all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, an estimated 486,000 people are treated for burns and approximately 40,000 are hospitalized annually (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4113">American Burn Association [ABA], 2016</a>). The largest proportion of burns, 41%, was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1866" title="1866"></span>reported as flame related, 35% were scalds, 10% were from direct source contact, 3% were electrical, 3% were chemical contact, 3% were inhalation only, and the remaining 5% were from unspecified or miscellaneous categories. Of those admitted to burn centers, the incidence of burn injuries for men was generally more than twice that for women; for both men and women, adults between 20 and 30 years of age had the highest prevalence of burn injuries. Of the reported injuries, 73% occurred in the home, 8% were industry related, 5% were recreationally related, and the remaining 14% of injuries were from other sources (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4106">American Burn Association National Burn Repository [ABA NBR], 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with burn injuries have particularly prolonged hospital LOS. Many require multiple surgical interventions, extensive pain control interventions, prolonged periods of immobilization and rehabilitation, and protracted intravenous (IV) medication regimens, particularly opioids and antibiotics. Historically, LOS projection was one hospital day per percent total body burn surface area (TBSA) burn. This underestimates LOS and resource utilization, most particularly in those over 40 years of age or those with an inhalation injury (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4143">Taylor, Sen, Greenhalgh, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2704"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Age-related changes such as diminished mobility, postural stability, strength, coordination, sensation, visual acuity, and declining memory predispose older adults to burn injury. The population of older adults continues to grow, as does the number of burn injuries among older adults. Burn Injury Registry data over a 10-year period from 212,820 hospitalized patients with burns suggest that 15% of burn injuries requiring hospitalization occurred in patients 60 years of age and older, with fire/flame sources accounting for 56% of reported injuries (ABA NBR, 2018). Mortality associated with burns is greater in older adult patients than in younger adult patients when comparing injuries with similar severity. The overall mortality from burns in the adult over 59 years of age is approximately 13%; compared to a 2.9% overall mortality rate for all ages (ABA NBR, 2018). The lethal dose 50 describes the percentage of TBSA burn that results in 50% mortality for a population; for older adults, this remains 30% to 35% TBSA despite advances in treatment (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Jeschke &#x0026; Peck, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications associated with burn injuries are also highest in patients 60 years and older. Of all reported complications, pneumonia was the most common, followed closely by urinary tract infections. Other reported complications include respiratory failure, septicemia, cellulitis, wound infection, kidney injury, arrhythmias, and other hospital-acquired infections such as central line bloodstream infections (ABA NBR, 2018). There is evidence that frailty and high comorbidities can cause critical decompensation in even small TBSA burns for those 50 years of age and older (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4130">Maxwell, Rhee, Drake, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4138">Romanowski, Curtis, Palmieri, et al., 2018</a>). Therefore, premorbid physiology should be considered when planning care for the older adult patient with a burn injury.</p>
<p class="indent">The skin of the older adult is thinner and less elastic, which affects the depth of injury and its ability to heal. Pulmonary function becomes impaired with age affecting airway exchange, lung elasticity, and ventilation; these effects can be exacerbated by a history of smoking. Decreased cardiac output, presence of coronary artery disease, and decreased cardiovascular compensatory response increase the risk of complications in older adult patients with burn injuries. There may be a very fine line between adequate fluid resuscitation and fluid overload in this population. Decreased kidney and hepatic function can affect medication dosing due to altered medication clearance. Malnutrition may affect morbidity and mortality in older adults, especially those who are institutionalized. Additionally, older adult patients may have varying degrees of mental capacity on admission or throughout the course of care, rendering assessment of pain, anxiety, and delirium a challenge for the burn team.</p>
<p class="indent">Comorbidities are common among older adults and, when combined with treatments, result in polypharmacy (i.e., multiple medication prescriptions), which contribute to in-hospital complications and increase the need for discharge to a facility other than the patient&#x2019;s home after acute recovery. Nurses need to assess the older adult patient&#x2019;s ability to safely perform activities of daily living (ADLs), assist older adult patients and families to modify their environment to ensure safety, and make referrals as needed. In addition, an assessment of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) is warranted (see <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> for further discussion of IADLs). This is an assessment of the ability to carry out more complex tasks such as meal preparation, traveling to appointments, etc., and is particularly important for those returning home without a caregiver (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4115">American Psychological Association, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2705">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Almost all burns are preventable. An important goal of nurses in community and home settings is to provide education regarding prevention of burn injuries (see <a href="#ct57-1">Chart 57-1</a>). The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1867" title="1867"></span>WHO recommends heightened awareness of the burden of burn injury and its risk factors as imperatives to the development of an effective burn prevention program (WHO, 2018).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2706">Outlook for Survival and Recovery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The WHO (2018) estimated 265,000 annual deaths worldwide are caused by burns, the majority occurring in middle- to low-income populations, while nonfatal burns are a leading cause of morbidity including disfigurement, disability, and social stigma. The overall mortality rate for all TBSA burns in the United States reported to the National Burn Repository is 3% (ABA NBR, 2018). The strongest predictors for mortality in burn injuries include increased percent of TBSA burned, presence of inhalation injury, and increased age. Provision of evidenced-based, multidisciplinary, holistic care is crucial to improving both survival and recovery culminating in reintegration of the survivor into society.</p>
<p class="indent">Great strides in research on burn wound treatments and critical care have improved the survival rate of patients with burn injuries. Evaluation of long-term outcomes is possible because patients with very large burns are surviving their injuries. Continued research and advances in the areas of critical care, rehabilitation, and psychosocial and scar management are essential for continued progress in burn care (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4118">Bielson, Duethman, Howard, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2707">Severity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Multiple factors determine the severity of each burn injury. These factors include age of the patient; depth of the burn; amount of surface area of the body burned; the presence of inhalation injury; presence of other injuries; location of the injury in areas such as the face, the perineum, hands, or feet; and the presence of comorbid conditions. Careful assessment enables the burn team to estimate the likelihood of survival and develop an individualized plan of care for each patient (ABA, 2018).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Age</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Young children and older adults have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to other age groups with similar injuries and present a challenge for the burn team. Thinner skin at both ends of the age spectrum leads to deeper burns with more complications. This is an important factor when determining the severity of injury and potential outcomes for the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Burn Depth</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Burns are classified according to the depth of tissue destruction as depicted in <a href="#tt57-1">Table 57-1</a>. First-degree burns are superficial injuries that involve only the outermost layer of skin. These burns are painful and erythematous, but the epidermis is intact; if rubbed, the burned tissue does not separate from the underlying dermis. This is known as a negative Nikolsky&#x2019;s sign. A typical first-degree burn is a sunburn or superficial scald burn.</p>
<p class="indent">Second-degree (partial-thickness) burns involve the entire epidermis and varying portions of the dermis. They are painful and typically associated with blister formation. Healing time depends on the depth of dermal injury, typically ranging <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1868" title="1868"></span>from 2 to 3 weeks. Hair follicles and skin appendages remain intact. The wound bed is moist due to serous leakage from the peripheral microcirculation.</p>

<p class="indent">Third-degree (full-thickness) burns involve total destruction of the epidermis, dermis, and, in some cases, damage of underlying tissue. Wound color ranges widely from pale white to red, brown, or charred. The deeply burned area lacks sensation because the nerve fibers are damaged. The wound appears leathery and dry due to the destruction of the microcirculation. Skin organelles such as hair follicles and sweat glands may be affected. The severity of this burn is often deceiving to patients because they have no pain in the injury area (see <a href="#ff57-1">Fig. 57-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth-degree burns (deep burn necrosis) are those injuries that extend into deep tissue, muscle, or bone (see Fig.&#x00A0;57-2) (ABA, 2018; <a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Strauss &#x0026; Gillespie, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Burn depth determines whether spontaneous reepithelialization will occur. Determining burn depth can be difficult even for the experienced burn care provider. The following factors are considered in determining the depth of a burn: how the injury occurred, causative agent (such as flame or scalding liquid), temperature and duration of contact with the causative agent, and thickness of the skin at the injury site.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Extent of Body Surface Area Injured</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Various methods are utilized to estimate the TBSA affected by burns; among them are the rule of nines, the Lund and Browder method, and the palmer method. These tools assist the treatment team in making decisions about the plan of care, which may include transfer of the patient to a burn center. Burn centers are hospital based and are specially equipped with the resources and personnel to treat patients with burns from the time of injury through their rehabilitation. Burn center designation is conferred jointly by the ABA and the American College of Surgeons (ABA, 2019). <a href="#ct57-2">Chart 57-2</a> provides the ABA criteria for referral to a burn center.</p>
<p class="h7">Rule of Nines</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common method of estimating the extent of burns in adults is the rule of nines (see <a href="#ff57-3">Fig. 57-3</a>). This system is based on anatomic regions, each representing approximately 9% of the TBSA, allowing clinicians to rapidly estimate percent of body burned. If the burn affects only a portion of an anatomic area, the TBSA is calculated accordingly&#x2014;for example, if approximately half of one arm were burned, the TBSA burned would be 4.5%.</p>
<p class="h7">Lund and Browder Method</p>
<p class="nonindent">A more precise method of estimating the extent of a burn is the Lund and Browder method, which recognizes the percentage of surface area of various anatomic parts, especially the head and legs, as it relates to the age of the patient. By dividing the body into very small areas and providing an estimate of the proportion of TBSA accounted for by each body part, clinicians can obtain a reliable estimate of TBSA burned. The initial evaluation made on arrival of the patient to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1869" title="1869"></span>hospital should be revised within the first 72 hours, because demarcation of the wound and its depth present themselves more clearly by this time. The Lund and Browder chart is readily available in both printed and electronic formats (ABA, 2018).</p>

<p class="h7">Palmer Method</p>
<p class="nonindent">In patients with scattered burns, or very large burns with minimal sparing, the palmer method is an expeditious method to determine extent of injury. The size of the patient&#x2019;s hand, including the fingers, is approximately 1% of that patient&#x2019;s TBSA (ABA, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2708">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Burns are exceptionally traumatic injuries as the initial injury evolves and worsens over time. Burn injury is the result of a chemical exposure or heat transfer from one site to another, causing tissue destruction through coagulation, protein denaturation, or ionization of cellular contents. The burn wound is not homogenous; rather, tissue necrosis generally occurs at the center of the injury with regions of tissue viability toward the periphery. The central area of the wound is termed the <em>zone of coagulation</em> due to the characteristic coagulation necrosis of cells that occurs (see <a href="#ff57-4">Fig. 57-4</a>). The surrounding zone, the <em>zone of stasis,</em> describes an area of injured cells that may remain viable but, with persistent ischemia, will undergo necrosis within 24 to 48 hours. The outermost zone, the <em>zone of hyperemia,</em> sustains minimal injury and may fully recover spontaneously over time.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff57-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff57-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff57-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;57-4 &#x2022;</span> Zones of burn injury. Each burned area has three zones of injury. The zone of coagulation (the innermost area, where cellular death occurs) sustains the most damage. The zone of stasis (the middle area) has a compromised blood supply, inflammation, and tissue injury. The zone of hyperemia (the outermost area) sustains the least damage.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The skin and the mucosa of the upper airways are the most common sites of tissue destruction, although deep tissues, including the viscera, can be damaged by electrical burns (see <a href="#ct57-3">Chart 57-3</a>) or prolonged contact with a heat or chemical source. The release of local mediators, changes in blood flow, tissue edema, and infection can cause progression in severity of the burn injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Another potential mechanism of burn injury is radiation exposure. This has received increased attention because of threats of terrorism and recent world events. Radiation injuries produce two detrimental effects. The first is a thermal effect, which results in cutaneous burn injuries. The second effect is damage to the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which may be localized or affect the whole body. Morbidity and mortality are dose dependent (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>). Treatment for the cutaneous injury is the same as other burns discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The depth of a burn injury depends on the temperature of the burning agent and the duration of contact with the agent. In adults, exposure to temperatures of 54&#x00B0;C (130&#x00B0;F) for 30 seconds will result in burn injury. At 60&#x00B0;C (140&#x00B0;F), tissue destruction occurs in 5 seconds (this is a common setting for home water heaters; see <a href="#ct57-1">Chart 57-1</a> for discussion of appropriate water heater setting). At 71&#x00B0;C (160&#x00B0;F) or higher, a full-thickness burn occurs instantaneously (ABA, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to recognize injuries that affect more than approximately 20% TBSA as severe injuries, as they produce both local and systemic effects. The systemic inflammatory response to a severe burn injury signals the release of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, prompting hypermetabolism effects that produce organ dysfunction, a pronounced catabolic response, systemic compromise and, potentially, mortality (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4136">Rehou, Shahrokhi, Natanson, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Electrical Burns</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Electrical injuries are devastating and complex burns. Heat generated by electricity is directly responsible for tissue damage, but unlike most thermal burns, visual examination of wounds is not predictive of burn size and severity. It is helpful to know the circumstances of the injury to anticipate potential tissue damage and complications. Superficial injuries present themselves as contact points on physical examination. Deep tissue injuries caused by the conduction of electrical current through the body may not be visible on initial clinical presentation, but in most circumstances should be assumed on presentation so that timely intervention may be initiated. Mechanisms of injury include flash, conductive, and lightning injury.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Flash Injury</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">An electrical flash generates light and heat. Injury occurs from the heat generated to exposed areas or by flames from ignition of clothing. Flash burns are thermal burns and have fewer complications; patients with flash injuries have shorter lengths of stay than those with conductive injuries.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Conductive Injury</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Conductive electrical injuries occur when the current overcomes the skin&#x2019;s resistance and travels through the body. The amount and severity of tissue damage is directly proportional to the strength of the current (voltage), duration of contact with the source, which organs lay along the pathway of current, and whether the current is direct or alternating. Conduction of electricity through the nerves and vessels and along the outside of bones generates heat, causing damage to adjacent tissues and direct injury to the peripheral nerves. Deep muscle injury may be present without injury to superficial muscles, masking the true extent of the injury. In addition, electrical current immediately contracts muscles as it travels through the body causing possible skeletal and joint injuries in high-voltage contact. Although the majority of reported electrical injuries are high-voltage (&#x003E;1000 volts) injuries, significant physical and psychological morbidity also occur with low-voltage (&#x003C;1000 volts) injuries as well.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Entrance and exit wounds or contact points can help identify the probable current path and therefore anticipated tissue and organ involvement. Direct current (DC) travels in one direction, is associated with an explosion and likely concomitant trauma from the blast. Alternating current (AC) passes back and forth from the point of contact, through the body and back to the source many times per second and can hold the victim to it, increasing contact time. Compartment syndrome is common with electrical injuries due to the edema that results from injured tissue compounded by the large fluid volumes required for resuscitation to prevent kidney failure. As a result, invasive decompressive therapies such as fasciotomies, nerve releases, ocular releases, and laparotomies may be required.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Lightning Injury</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Lightning injuries can result from a direct strike, a high-voltage DC injury that is usually fatal, or a side flash wherein the current discharges from an object nearby through the air to an adjacent object or person. Side flashes are the most common cause of injury and result in immediate deep polarization of the entire myocardium with possible cardiac arrest. Respiratory arrest is also expected because electric current can temporarily inactivate the brain&#x2019;s respiratory center. Lightning strikes carry approximately 10% mortality rate, with many survivors reporting permanent morbidity and debilitating symptoms including neurologic disabilities, depression, sleep disorders, chronic, and at times, intense pain, memory loss, attention deficits, numbness, dizziness, stiffness in joints, irritability, fatigue, weakness, and muscle spasms.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Management</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Resuscitation fluid calculations based on total body surface area are inaccurate in conductive electrical injuries, including some lightning injuries. It is difficult to quantify the extent of tissue injury without surgical exploration because the damage may not be visible on physical examination. Serum creatinine kinase levels are useful in determining the degree of muscle injury in the early phases of care. Myoglobinuria, common with muscle damage, may cause kidney failure if not treated. Intravenous (IV) fluid administration titrated to a higher target of urine output per hour than usual may be indicated until the urine is no longer red. It is common practice to add 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate per liter of IV fluid in an effort to assist in alkalinizing the urine. Serum myoglobin and urine myoglobin levels may be monitored as indicators of the need for continued resuscitation.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Finally, the surgical treatment of an electrical injury is as complex as the injury itself. Vasculature is commonly affected; thus, progressive tissue necrosis occurs over time. Sequential surgical d&#x00E9;bridement may be necessary, using caution to preserve viable tissue.</p>

<p class="indent">Severe injuries ultimately encompass changes in pathophysiology of all body systems as presented in <a href="#tt57-2">Table 57-2</a>. These pathologic responses occur in trauma injuries, but the magnitude, duration, and severity are significantly higher with burn injuries.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiovascular Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When a burn injury occurs, there is an immediate decrease in cardiac output that precedes the loss of plasma volume. The systemic inflammation causes the release of free oxygen radicals that increase capillary permeability, causing increased plasma loss and subsequent peripheral edema as water migrates to the interstitium. As a compensatory response to intravascular fluid loss, the sympathetic nervous system releases catecholamines, resulting in an increase in peripheral resistance (vasoconstriction) and an increase in pulse rate that further decreases tissue perfusion. Due to vasoconstrictive compensatory responses secondary to plasma volume loss through capillary leak, the workload of the heart and oxygen demand increase (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Gillenwater &#x0026; Garner, 2017</a>; <a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4112">Wurzer, Culnan, Cancio, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hypovolemia is the immediate consequence of ensuing plasma volume loss and results in decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery to organs and tissues. As capillary leakage continues, vascular volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure decrease. This is the onset of early burn shock. Burn shock is initially a type of hypovolemic shock secondary to intravascular volume loss (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike traumatic injuries, often characterized by blood loss, only plasma is lost in the burn injury. Prompt, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1871" title="1871"></span>appropriate enteral or parenteral fluid resuscitation maintains the blood pressure in the low to normal range and improves cardiac output (see later discussion). However, even with adequate fluid resuscitation, cardiac filling pressures (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure) remain low during the initial burn shock period. Unless sufficient IV fluids are administered to maintain vascular volume, distributive shock occurs (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Generally, the greatest volume of intravascular fluid leak occurs in the first 24 to 36 hours after the burn injury, peaking at approximately 6 to 8 hours after the initial burn injury. As the capillaries begin to regain their integrity, burn shock resolves and fluid shifts back into the vascular compartment. Intrinsic diuresis will begin and continue for several days to 2&#x00A0;weeks in the previously healthy adult.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluid and Electrolyte Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Edema forms rapidly after a burn injury. A superficial burn will cause localized edema to form within 4 hours, whereas a deeper burn will continue to form edema up to 18 hours post injury. The increased perfusion to the injured area in the presence of increased capillary permeability reflects the amount of microvascular and lymphatic damage to the tissue. In burns greater than 20% TBSA, inflammatory mediators stimulate local and systemic reactions resulting in extensive shift of intravascular fluid, electrolytes, and proteins into the surrounding interstitium (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Gillenwater &#x0026; Garner, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img class="m" src="images/icon29cma.png" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt">For patients in the emergent/resuscitative phase, nurses should do a primary survey and closely monitor circulation. As the taut, burned tissue becomes unyielding to the edema beneath its surface, it begins to act like a tourniquet, especially if the burn is circumferential. As edema increases, pressure on small blood vessels in the distal extremities obstructs blood flow resulting in consequent tissue ischemia and potentially acute compartment syndrome. See <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> for discussion of acute compartment syndrome. Patients in the acute/intermediate phase must be closely monitored for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p>

<p class="indent1">Treatments for edema may include elevation of the extremity or, in severe cases, cutting of the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;eschar:&lt;/b&gt; devitalized tissue resulting from a burn or wound">eschar</button></strong> (i.e., devitalized tissue) via <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;escharotomy:&lt;/b&gt; a linear excision made through eschar to release constriction of underlying tissue">escharotomy</button></strong> (i.e., surgical incision through eschar), or decompression of edema formation via <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fasciotomy:&lt;/b&gt; an incision made through the fascia to release constriction of underlying muscle">fasciotomy</button></strong> (i.e., surgical incision through fascia to relieve constricted muscle) to restore tissue perfusion (see Figs. 57-5 and 57-6).</p>
<p class="indent">Reabsorption of edema begins about 4 hours post injury and is complete approximately 4 days postburn injury. However, the rate of reabsorption depends on the depth of injury to the tissue. Although adequate fluid resuscitation is paramount to maintaining tissue perfusion, excessive fluid administration increases edema formation in both burned and unburned tissue causing ischemia and necrosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately after burn injury, hyperkalemia (excessive potassium) may result from massive cell destruction. Hypokalemia (potassium depletion) may occur later with fluid shifts and inadequate potassium replacement. Serum sodium levels vary in response to fluid resuscitation. Hyponatremia (serum sodium depletion) may be present from plasma loss or may occur during the first week of the acute phase, as water <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1872" title="1872"></span>shifts from the interstitial space and returns to the vascular space.</p>

<p class="indent">At the time of burn injury, some red blood cells may be destroyed, and others damaged. Despite this, the early hematocrit may be elevated due to plasma loss (hemoconcentration). Abnormalities in coagulation, including a decrease in platelets (thrombocytopenia) and prolonged clotting and prothrombin times also occur.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pulmonary Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Inhalation injuries</em>, caused by inhalation of thermal and/or chemical irritants, are categorized as upper airway injury (above the glottis) or lower airway injury (below the glottis). Injuries above the vocal cords can be thermal or chemical, whereas injuries below the vocal cords are usually chemical (ABA, 2018). Approximately 2% to 14% of patients admitted to burn centers have an inhalation injury (ABA, 2018). The presence of inhalation injury is important to recognize, as it is one of the highest causes of mortality, along with age of the patient and burn size. History of the injury, such as a flame injury occurring in an enclosed space, and clinical signs such as singed facial hair or carbonaceous sputum (i.e., sputum with carbon particles which appears black; soot), are indicators for the potential presence of a smoke inhalation injury. Bronchoscopy is considered the standard test for definitive diagnosis as initial chest x-rays appear normal. The extent of pulmonary damage is directly related to the temperature and the concentration of toxic gases.</p>
<p class="h7">Upper Airway Injury</p>
<p class="nonindent">Upper airway injury is obstructive; it is caused by severe upper airway edema from direct thermal injury or secondary edema from face or neck burns in the early postburn period. Protective intubation is often warranted to maintain patency of the airway (ABA, 2018; <a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Jones et al., 2017</a>). Because of the cooling effect of rapid vaporization in the oropharynx, direct heat injury does not normally occur below the level of the glottis. However, with steam exposure or in blast injuries, thermal injury to the lower airways is possible because the upper airway cannot effectively protect the lower airway in these cases (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Jones et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Lower Airway Injury</p>
<p class="nonindent">Inhalation injury below the glottis results from inhaling the products of incomplete combustion or noxious gases and is often the source of death at the scene of a fire. Smoke inhalation causes loss of ciliary action, triggers an inflammatory response causing hypersecretion, producing severe mucosal edema and potential bronchospasm. A reduction in alveolar surfactant production produces atelectasis (collapse of alveoli) in the parenchyma. Expectoration of carbon particles in the sputum is the cardinal sign of a lower airway inhalation injury. Aggressive pulmonary toilet is critical to maintain airway patency and clear resulting viscous sputum. Outcomes are improved in lower airway injuries when patients can expectorate carbonaceous sputum naturally (i.e., among patients who are not endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated) (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Jones et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Noxious gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide, contribute to lower airway injuries. CO poisoning is a factor in most fatalities at the scene of a fire as it combines with hemoglobin and displaces oxygen to form <strong>carboxyhemoglobin.</strong> The affinity of hemoglobin for CO is 200 times greater than that for oxygen, and if significant quantities of CO are present, then tissue hypoxia will occur. Treatment is administration of 100% oxygen to displace the CO molecules bound to hemoglobin, bringing the half-life of CO down to 45 minutes (ABA, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Hydrogen cyanide is a rapid systemic toxin also associated with mortality. Signs and symptoms are similar to CO poisoning and can include shortness of breath, headache, vertigo, confusion, and mucous membrane irritation. The cardiopulmonary effects initially cause a hyperdynamic response followed by bradycardia and hypotension leading to death. Hydrogen cyanide poisoning may be suspected in a patient with persistent lactic acidosis after resuscitation (ABA, 2018). Gaseous cyanide is a result from incomplete combustion of many items found in homes today.</p>
<p class="indent">Bronchoconstriction (caused by release of histamine, serotonin, and thromboxane [a powerful vasoconstrictor]) and chest constriction secondary to circumferential torso burns can contribute to deterioration. Even without pulmonary injury, hypoxia may be present. Early in the postburn period, catecholamine release in response to the stress of the burn injury alters peripheral blood flow, thereby reducing oxygen delivery to the periphery. Later, hypermetabolism and continued catecholamine release lead to increased tissue oxygen consumption, which can also lead to hypoxia. Administration of supplemental oxygen will ensure that adequate oxygen is available to the tissues. Restrictive pulmonary excursion may occur with full-thickness burns encircling the thorax resulting in decreased tidal volume. In such situations, an escharotomy may be necessary to restore adequate chest excursion (ABA, 2018).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Kidney Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Kidney function may be altered as a result of decreased blood volume postburn injury due to the compensatory response to intravascular volume loss. Adequate fluid volume replacement can restore renal blood flow, increasing the glomerular filtration rate and urine volume. Additionally, destruction of red blood cells at the injury site may result in free hemoglobin in the urine. If muscle damage occurs (e.g., from electrical burns), myoglobin is released from the muscle cells and excreted by the kidneys causing the urine to be red. If there is inadequate blood flow through the kidneys caused by the hemoglobin and myoglobin occluding the renal tubules, acute tubular necrosis and acute kidney injury will occur (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>). Increased abdominal pressure from the injury can also cause kidney ischemia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Immunologic Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The immunologic defenses of the body are significantly altered by a burn injury. Skin, the largest barrier to infection, when compromised continually exposes the patient to the environment. The burn injury itself produces systemic release of cytokines and other substances that cause leukocyte and endothelial cell dysfunction. Burn centers must provide an infection-controlled environment to protect the patient and minimize exposure to potentially harmful organisms (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Palmieri, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1872</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1873" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1873">p. 1873</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Thermoregulatory Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Integumentary loss also causes an inability to regulate body temperature resulting in various complications. Patients with burn injuries often exhibit low body temperatures in the early hours after injury not necessarily due to initial first aid, which may include cooling of the wounds, but more likely from the amount of TBSA involved, the IV resuscitation fluids administered, and exposure resulting in increased evaporative heat loss (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4122">Ehrl, Heidekrueger, Rubenbauger, et al., 2018</a>). Burn centers often have additional heating sources to help maintain the patient&#x2019;s body temperature through environmental warming.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who are critically ill, especially those with burns, are predisposed to altered gastrointestinal (GI) motility. Impaired enteric nerve and smooth muscle function, inflammation, surgery, medications such as vasopressors, and inadequate tissue perfusion are some causes of GI dysfunction. Indicators of GI organ ischemia include increased bladder pressure, increasing serum lactate, and feeding intolerance. Three of the most common GI alterations in patients with burns are paralytic ileus (absence of intestinal peristalsis), Curling&#x2019;s ulcer, and translocation of bacteria. Decreased peristalsis and bowel sounds are manifestations of paralytic ileus. Gastric distention and nausea may lead to vomiting; therefore, gastric decompression is advised. Gastric bleeding secondary to massive physiologic stress may be signaled by occult blood in the stool, regurgitation of &#x201C;coffee-ground&#x201D; material from the stomach, or bloody vomitus. These signs suggest gastric or duodenal erosion (Curling&#x2019;s ulcer). Probiotics may be useful in maintaining intestinal barrier function through avoidance of colonization of pathogenic microorganisms (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Culnan, Capek, &#x0026; Sheridan, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Thermal injury damages the liver through induction of hepatic edema, apoptosis, insulin resistance associated with metabolic derangements, and development of a fatty liver. In addition, with severe burn injury, acute pancreatitis is common and may result in a threefold increase in amylase or lipase, feeding intolerance, or abdominal pain (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Culnan et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with large TBSA burns are also at risk for life-threatening abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) due to large volumes of fluid required for resuscitation, fluid shifts to the interstitium causing edema formation, and decreased abdominal wall compliance due to eschar formation. Increased pressure in the abdominal cavity contributes to GI tract and abdominal organ ischemia (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Ramirez, Palmieri, Greenhalgh, and colleagues (2018) reviewed 10&#x00A0;years of cases of ACS in patients with burns and found support for early laparotomy as definitive treatment of ACS.</p>
