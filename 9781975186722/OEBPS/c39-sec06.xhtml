<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sialadenitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the salivary glands">Sialadenitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the salivary glands) may be caused by dehydration, radiation therapy, stress, malnutrition, salivary gland calculi (stones; sialolithiasis), or improper oral hygiene. The inflammation is commonly associated with infection by <em>S. aureus</em>, which requires antibiotic therapy. In hospitalized or institutionalized patients, the infecting organism may be methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA). Symptoms include pain, swelling, and purulent discharge. Massage, hydration, warm compresses, and sialagogues (substances that trigger saliva flow like hard candy or lemon juice) frequently <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1235" title="1235"></span>cure the problem. Chronic sialadenitis is typically due to decreased salivary flow and may be treated with sialendscopy, an endoscopic procedure that allows for direct visualization of Stensen duct (diagnostic) and instillation of antibiotics, corticosteroids, or irrigation (treatment), particularly in adolescents with recurrent parotitis (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2928">Papadopoulou-Alataki, Dogantzis, Chatziavramidis, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Surgical drainage or excision of the gland and its duct are considered in cases of sialadenitis that are recurrent or refractory to antibiotics.</p>
