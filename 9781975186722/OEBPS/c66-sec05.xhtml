<h4 class="h4" id="s3140">Sexually Transmitted Infections</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are diseases acquired through sexual contact with a person who is infected. Select STIs and their routes of transmission are included in <a href="c66-sec01.xhtml#tt66-1">Table&#x00A0;66-1</a>. Infections caused by organisms not generally considered STIs can also be transmitted during sexual contact&#x2014;for example, <em>G. lamblia,</em> usually associated with contaminated water, can be transmitted through sexual exposure. STIs are sometimes called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well.</p>
<p class="indent">STIs are the most common infectious diseases in the United States and are epidemic in most parts of the world. Portals of entry of STI-causing microorganisms and sites of infection include the skin and mucosal linings of the urethra, cervix, vagina, rectum, and oropharynx.</p>
<p class="indent">More than 2 million STIs are reported among Americans annually. However, many infections go undiagnosed or unreported, so surveillance data underestimate true incidence. Surveillance reliability is diminished when public health departments are underfunded, and when some populations have decreased access to care (CDC, 2020q).</p>
<p class="indent">Education about prevention of STIs includes information about risk factors and behaviors that can lead to infection. Using straightforward language and personal testimonials for targeted audiences (e.g., people who want information about protecting themselves) and conducting presentations with trusted establishments (e.g., churches, health care facilities) are the recommended educational strategies. Included in this education is information about the relative value of condoms in reducing the risk of infection. The use of condoms to provide a protective barrier from transmission of STI-related organisms has been broadly promoted, especially since the recognition of HIV/AIDS. At first referred to as a method to ensure <em>safe sex,</em> the use of condoms has been shown to reduce but not eliminate the risk of transmission of HIV and other STIs. Thus, the term <em>safer sex</em> more appropriately connotes the public health message to be used when promoting the use of condoms. See <a href="c32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a> for most information about AIDS and HIV.</p>
<p class="indent">STIs provide a unique set of challenges for nurses, physicians, and public health officials. Because of perceived stigma and possible threat to emotional relationships, people with symptoms of STIs are often reluctant to seek health care in a timely fashion. STIs may progress without symptoms, and a delay in diagnosis and treatment is potentially harmful because the risk of complications for the person who is infected and the risk of transmission to others increase over time.</p>
<p class="indent">Infection with one STI suggests the possibility of infection with other diseases as well. After one STI is identified, diagnostic evaluation for others should be conducted. The possibility of HIV infection should be pursued when any STI is diagnosed.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3141">Syphilis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Syphilis is an acute and chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete <em>Treponema pallidum.</em> It is acquired through sexual contact or may be congenital in origin. The rates of primary and secondary syphilis have been on the rise, with a 15% increase between 2017 and 2018 (CDC, 2020q).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3142">Stages of Syphilis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The course of untreated syphilis can be divided into three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. These stages reflect the time from infection and the clinical manifestations observed in that period and are the basis for treatment decisions.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Primary syphilis</em> occurs 2 to 3 weeks after initial inoculation with the organism. Painless lesions at the site of infection, called chancres, usually resolve spontaneously within 3 to 12 weeks, with or without treatment (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Secondary syphilis</em> occurs by hematogenous spread leading to generalized infection. The rash of secondary syphilis occurs from 1 week to 6 months after the chancre (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Norris, 2019</a>). Transmission can occur through contact with these lesions. Generalized signs of infection may include lymphadenopathy, arthritis, meningitis, hair loss, fever, malaise, and weight loss.</p>
<p class="indent">After the secondary stage, there is a period of latency, when the person who is infected has no signs or symptoms of syphilis. Latency can be interrupted by a recurrence of secondary syphilis symptoms (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Tertiary syphilis</em> is the final stage in the natural history of the disease. It is estimated that between 20% and 40% of those infected do not exhibit signs and symptoms in this final stage. Tertiary syphilis may present as a slowly progressive inflammatory disease with the potential to affect multiple organs. The most common manifestations at this level are aortitis and neurosyphilis, as evidenced by dementia, psychosis, paresis, stroke, or meningitis (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3143">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because syphilis shares symptoms with many diseases, clinical history and laboratory evaluation are important. The conclusive diagnosis of syphilis can be made by direct identification <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2169" title="2169"></span>of the spirochete obtained from the chancre lesions of primary syphilis. Serologic tests used in the diagnosis of secondary and tertiary syphilis require clinical correlation in interpretation. The serologic tests are summarized as follows (O&#x2019;Bryne, 2019):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Nontreponemal</em> or <em>reagin tests,</em> such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or the rapid plasma reagin circle test (RPR-CT), are generally used for screening and diagnosis. After adequate therapy, the test result is expected to decrease quantitatively until it is read as negative, usually about 2 years after therapy is completed.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Treponemal tests,</em> such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test and the microhemagglutination test for <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (MHA-TP), are used to verify that the screening test did not represent a false-positive result. Positive results usually are positive for life and therefore are not appropriate to determine therapeutic effectiveness</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3144">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of all stages of syphilis is administration of antibiotic medications. Penicillin G benzathine is the medication of choice for early syphilis or early latent syphilis of less than 1 year&#x2019;s duration. It is given by intramuscular injection at a single session. Patients with late latent or latent syphilis of unknown duration should receive three injections at 1-week intervals. Patients who are allergic to penicillin are usually treated with doxycycline. The patient treated with penicillin is monitored for 30 minutes after the injection to observe for a possible allergic reaction (CDC, 2020s).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment guidelines established by the CDC are updated on a regular basis. Recommendations provide special guidelines for treatment in the setting of pregnancy, allergy, HIV infection, pediatric infection, congenital infection, and neurosyphilis. The CDC Web site, &#x201C;Sexually Transmitted Diseases,&#x201D; provides a link to the most recent guidelines as well as additional information about drug shortages and other concurrent treatment considerations. The Web site also regularly updates guidance about how to modify usual STI/STD screening and treatment care during the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC, 2020s).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3145">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Syphilis is a reportable communicable disease. In any health care facility, a mechanism must be in place to ensure that all patients who are diagnosed are reported to the state or local public health department to ensure community follow-up. The public health department is responsible for identification of sexual contacts, contact notification, and contact screening.</p>
<p class="indent">Lesions of primary and secondary syphilis may be highly infective. Gloves are worn when direct contact with lesions is likely, and hand hygiene is performed after gloves are removed. Isolation in a private room is not required (see <a href="#ct66-8">Chart&#x00A0;66-8</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3146"><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> Infections</h3>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> are the most commonly reported infectious diseases in the United States. Coinfection with <em>C. trachomatis</em> often occurs in patients infected with <em>N. gonorrhoeae.</em> The greatest risk of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection occurs in young women between 15 and 24 years of age (CDC, 2020q, 2020r).</p>
<div class="box11a"><p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct66-8"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;66-8</strong> <img class="ex2" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> <strong>PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Preventing the Spread of Syphilis</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>

<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Refrain from sexual contact with previous or current partners until the partners have been treated.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that if you have primary or secondary syphilis, skin lesions and other sequelae of infection will improve with proper treatment, and serology eventually will reflect cure.</p>

<p class="bfoot">STIs, sexually transmitted infections.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3147">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Both <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> infections frequently do not cause symptoms in women. When symptoms are present, mucopurulent cervicitis with exudates in the endocervical canal is the most frequent finding. Women with gonorrhea can also present with symptoms of urinary tract infection or vaginitis. See <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a> for more in-depth coverage of STIs in women.</p>
<p class="indent">Although men are more likely than women to have symptoms when infected, infection with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>C. trachomatis</em> can be asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they may include burning during urination and penile discharge. Patients with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> infection may also report painful, swollen testicles (CDC, 2020q, 2020r).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3148">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In women, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, endometritis, and infertility are possible complications of either <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection. In men, epididymitis, a painful disease that may lead to infertility, may result from infection with either bacterium. In both men and women, arthritis or bloodstream infection may be caused by <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (CDC, 2020q, 2020r).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3149">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is assessed for fever, discharge (urethral, vaginal, or rectal), and signs of arthritis. Diagnostic methods used in <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> infection include Gram stain (appropriate only for male urethral samples), culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Gram stain and the direct fluorescent antibody test can be used in chlamydia. NAATs are also available for <em>C. trachomatis</em>. In the female patient, samples are obtained from the endocervix, anal canal, and pharynx. In the male patient, specimens are obtained from the urethra, anal canal, and pharynx. Because <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> organisms are susceptible to environmental changes, specimens for culture must be delivered to the laboratory immediately after they are obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Because as many as 70% of chlamydial infections are asymptomatic, the CDC recommends <em>Chlamydia</em> testing for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2170" title="2170"></span>all women who are pregnant. Annual testing is also recommended for women younger than 25 years who are sexually active, and for women over 25 years who have a new sexual partner or multiple partners (CDC, 2020q, 2020r).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3150">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because patients are often coinfected with both gonorrhea and chlamydia, dual therapy is recommended, even if only gonorrhea has been laboratory proven (CDC, 2020r). The CDC guidelines should be used to determine alternative therapy for the patient who is pregnant or allergic or who has a complicated chlamydial infection. The CDC updates STI therapy recommendations regularly because of growing challenges with bacterial antibiotic resistance patterns and drug shortages (CDC, 2020r).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the number of resistant strains of gonorrhea has increased, that is not the reason for the use of combination antibiotic therapy. Such therapy is prescribed in order to treat both gonorrhea and chlamydia, because many patients with gonorrhea have a coexisting chlamydial infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea who are treated with CDC-recommended therapy do not routinely need to return for a proof-of-cure visit. If the patient reports a new episode of symptoms or tests are positive for gonorrhea again, the most likely explanation is reinfection rather than treatment failure. Serologic testing for syphilis and HIV should be offered to patients with gonorrhea or chlamydia, because any STI increases the risk of other STIs (CDC, 2020r).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3151">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Gonorrhea and chlamydia are reportable communicable diseases. In any health care facility, a mechanism should be in place to ensure that all patients who are diagnosed are reported to the local public health department to ensure follow-up of the patient. The public health department also is responsible for interviewing the patient to identify sexual contacts so that contact notification and screening can be initiated.</p>
<p class="indent">The target group for preventive patient education about gonorrhea and chlamydia is the adolescent and young adult population. Along with reinforcing the importance of abstinence, when appropriate, education should address postponing the age of initial sexual exposure, limiting the number of sexual partners, and using condoms for barrier protection. Young women and those who are pregnant should also be instructed about the importance of routine screening for chlamydia.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient should be asked to describe the onset and progression of symptoms and to characterize any lesions by location and by describing drainage, if present. Brief explanations of why the information is needed are often helpful. Clarification of terms may be necessary if either the patient or nurse uses words that are unfamiliar to the other.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Protecting confidentiality is important when discussing sexual issues. When a detailed sexual history is necessary, it is important to respect the patient&#x2019;s right to privacy. When obtaining a sexual history, the CDC recommends the following systematic interview of key areas, the &#x201C;five Ps&#x201D;: <em>p</em>artners, <em>p</em>revention of pregnancy, <em>p</em>rotection from STIs, <em>p</em>ractices, and <em>p</em>ast history of STIs.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Asking specific information about sexual contacts usually should be done only when the nurse is part of a team that will conduct partner notification. The nurse should describe to the patient the public health notification process and resources that are available to assist sexual partners or infants and children.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During the physical examination, the examiner looks for rashes, lesions, drainage, discharge, or swelling. Inguinal nodes are palpated to elicit tenderness and to assess swelling. Women are examined for abdominal or uterine tenderness. The mouth and throat are examined for signs of inflammation or exudate. The nurse wears gloves while examining the mucous membranes, and gloves are changed and replaced after vaginal or rectal examination.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Major goals are increased patient understanding of the natural history and treatment of the infection, reduction in anxiety, increased adherence with therapeutic and preventive goals, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="smallcaps">NCREASING</span> K<span class="smallcaps">NOWLEDGE AND</span> P<span class="smallcaps">REVENTING</span> S<span class="smallcaps">PREAD OF</span> D<span class="smallcaps">ISEASE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Education about STIs and prevention of the spread to others are often accomplished simultaneously. The patient who is infected should be told what the causative organism is and should receive an explanation of the usual course of the infection (including the interval of potential communicability to others) and possible complications. The nurse should stress the importance of following therapy as prescribed and the need to report any side effects or symptom progression. Discussion should emphasize that the same behaviors that led <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2171" title="2171"></span>to infection with one STI increase the risk of infection with other STIs, including HIV. Methods used to contact sexual partners should be discussed. The patient should understand that until the partner has been treated, continued sexual exposure to the same person may lead to reinfection.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Target groups for preventive patient education about STIs include the adolescent and young adult populations. Along with reinforcing the importance of abstinence, when appropriate, education should address postponing the age of initial sexual exposure, limiting the number of sexual partners, and using condoms for barrier protection. The use of condoms reduces but does not eliminate the risk of transmission of HIV and other STIs.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="smallcaps">EDUCING</span> A<span class="smallcaps">NXIETY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">When appropriate, the patient is encouraged to discuss anxieties and fear associated with the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis. By individualizing education, factual information applied to specific needs may offer reassurance. Patients may need help in planning discussion with partners. If the patient is especially apprehensive about this aspect, referral to a social worker or other specialist may be appropriate. For example, such support is especially important when the patient has newly diagnosed HIV infection. Patients with HIV may benefit from programs that combine support, education, counseling, and therapeutic goals. Such programs are designed to offer coordinated care throughout the course of disease progression.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="smallcaps">NCREASING</span> A<span class="smallcaps">DHERENCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">In group settings (e.g., an outpatient obstetric setting) or in a one-to-one setting, open discussion about STI information facilitates patient education. Discomfort can be reduced by factual explanation of causes, consequences, treatments, prevention, and responsibilities. Because most communities have expanded STI prevention resources, referrals to appropriate agencies can complement individual educational efforts and ensure that later questions or uncertainties can be addressed by experts.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="pr_head">Congenital Infections.</span> All STIs can be transmitted to infants in utero or at the time of birth. Complications of congenital infection can range from localized infection (e.g., throat infection with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>), to congenital abnormalities (e.g., stunting of growth or deafness from congenital syphilis), and to life-threatening disease (e.g., congenital herpes simplex virus).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="pr_head">Neurosyphilis, Gonococcal Meningitis, Gonococcal Arthritis, and Syphilitic Aortitis.</span> STIs can cause disseminated infection. The central nervous system may be infected, as seen in cases of neurosyphilis or gonococcal meningitis. Gonorrhea that infects the skeletal system may result in gonococcal arthritis.
