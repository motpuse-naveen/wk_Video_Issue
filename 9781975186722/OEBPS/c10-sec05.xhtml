<h4 class="h4" id="s208">Sodium Imbalances</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is the most abundant electrolyte in the ECF; its concentration ranges from 135 to 145 mEq/L (135 to 145 mmol/L), and it is the primary determinant of ECF volume and osmolality. Sodium has a major role in controlling water distribution throughout the body, because it does not easily cross the plasma membrane and because of its abundance and high concentration in the body. Sodium is regulated by ADH, thirst, and the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system. A loss or gain of sodium is usually accompanied by a loss or gain of water. Sodium also functions in establishing the electrochemical state necessary for muscle contraction and the transmission of nerve impulses (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) may be associated with sodium imbalance. When there is a decrease in the circulating plasma osmolality, blood volume, or blood pressure, ADH (also called arginine vasopressin [AVP]) is released from the posterior pituitary. Oversecretion of ADH can cause SIADH. Patients at risk for SIADH include older adults; those who have had brain surgery or have a brain tumor, pulmonary malignancy, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); those on mechanical ventilation; and those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Sterns, 2017d). (SIADH is discussed in more detail in <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium imbalance can develop under simple or complex circumstances. The two most common sodium imbalances are sodium deficit and sodium excess (<a href="#tt10-6">Table&#x00A0;10-6</a>).</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s209">Sodium Deficit (Hyponatremia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hyponatremia refers to a serum sodium level that is less than 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L) (Sterns, 2017e). Hyponatremia can present as an acute or chronic form. Acute hyponatremia is commonly the result of a fluid overload in a surgical patient. This is a dilutional hyponatremia because the excess water dilutes the sodium in the bloodstream. Chronic hyponatremia is seen more frequently in patients outside the hospital setting, has a longer duration, and has less serious neurologic sequelae. Another type of hyponatremia is exercised-associated hyponatremia, which is more frequently found in women and those of smaller stature. It can occur during extreme temperatures, because of excessive fluid intake before exercise, or prolonged exercise that results in excess loss of sodium through perspiration (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Apostu, 2014</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib794">McDermott, Anderson, Armstrong, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s210">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hyponatremia primarily occurs due to an imbalance of water rather than sodium. Checking the urine sodium value can assist in differentiating renal from nonrenal causes of hyponatremia. Low sodium in the urine occurs as the nephrons of the kidney retain sodium to compensate for nonrenal fluid loss (i.e., vomiting, diarrhea, sweating). High sodium concentration in the urine is associated with renal salt wasting that occurs in renal dysfunction or diuretic use. In dilutional hyponatremia, the ECF volume has excess water but there is no edema, and the excess water dilutes the sodium (Sterns, 2017e).</p>
<p class="indent">A deficiency of aldosterone, as occurs in adrenal insufficiency, also predisposes to sodium deficiency. Lack of aldosterone causes lack of sodium and water reabsorption into the bloodstream at the nephrons. In addition, the use of certain medications, such as anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam), SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine), or desmopressin acetate, have side effects that increase the risk of hyponatremia (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib789">Liamis, Megapanou, Elisaf, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s211">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia depend on the cause, magnitude, and speed with which the deficit occurs. Poor skin turgor, dry mucosa, headache, decreased saliva production, orthostatic fall in blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping can occur. Neurologic changes, including altered mental status, status epilepticus, and coma, are related to the cellular swelling and cerebral edema associated with hyponatremia. As the extracellular sodium level decreases, the cellular fluid becomes relatively more concentrated and pulls water into the cells (<a href="#ff10-7">Fig.&#x00A0;10-7</a>). In general, patients with an acute decrease in serum sodium levels have more cerebral edema and higher mortality rates than do those with more slowly developing hyponatremia. Acute decreases in sodium, developing in less than 48 hours, may be associated with cerebral edema. Cerebral edema can lead to compression of brain stem structures and brain herniation. Chronic decreases in sodium, developing over 48 hours or more, can occur in status epilepticus and other neurologic conditions (Sterns, 2017e).</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical features of hyponatremia associated with sodium loss and water gain include anorexia, muscle cramps, and a feeling of exhaustion. The severity of symptoms increases with the degree of hyponatremia and the speed with which it develops. When the serum sodium level decreases to less than 115 mEq/L (115 mmol/L), signs of increasing intracranial pressure, such as lethargy, confusion, muscle twitching, focal weakness, hemiparesis, papilledema, seizures, and death, may occur (Sterns, 2017e).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s212">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Targeted assessment includes the history and physical examination with a focused neurologic examination; evaluation of signs and symptoms as well as laboratory test results; identification of current IV fluids, if applicable; and a review of all medications the patient is taking. Regardless of the cause of hyponatremia, the serum sodium level is less than 135 mEq/L; in SIADH, it may be lower than 100 mEq/L (100 mmol/L). Serum osmolality is usually decreased. When hyponatremia is due to lack of sodium ingestion, the urinary sodium content is less than 20 mEq/L (20 mmol/L) and the specific gravity is low (1.002 to 1.004). However, when hyponatremia is due to SIADH, the urinary sodium content is greater than 20 mEq/L, and the urine specific gravity is usually greater than 1.012. Although the patient with SIADH retains water abnormally there is no peripheral edema; instead, fluid accumulates inside the cells. This phenomenon sometimes manifests as pitting edema (Sterns, 2017d).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s213">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The key to treating hyponatremia is an assessment that focuses on the clinical symptoms of the patient and signs of hyponatremia (including laboratory values). As a general rule, treating the underlying condition will bring the sodium level back to normal.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sodium Replacement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most common treatment for hyponatremia is careful administration of sodium by mouth, nasogastric tube, or a parenteral route. For patients who can eat and drink, sodium is easily replaced, because sodium is consumed abundantly in a normal diet. For those who cannot consume sodium, lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution or isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) solution may be prescribed. Serum sodium must not be increased by more than 12 mEq/L in 24 hours to avoid neurologic damage due to demyelination (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib784">Jain, Phadke, Chauhan, et al., 2018</a>). This condition may occur when the serum sodium concentration is overcorrected (exceeding 140 mEq/L) too rapidly or in the presence of hypoxia or anoxia. It may produce lesions that show symmetric myelin destruction affecting all fiber tracts that can present with altered cognition and decreased alertness, ataxia, paraparesis, dysarthria, horizontal gaze paralysis, pseudobulbar palsy, and coma. The usual daily sodium requirement in adults is approximately 100 mEq, provided there are not excessive losses (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Sterns, 2020</a>). Select water and electrolyte solutions are described in <a href="c10-sec02.xhtml#tt10-5">Table&#x00A0;10-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In SIADH, the administration of hypertonic saline solution alone cannot change the plasma sodium concentration. Excess sodium would be excreted rapidly in highly concentrated urine. With the addition of the diuretic furosemide, urine is not concentrated and isotonic urine is excreted to effect a change in water balance. In patients with SIADH, in whom water restriction is difficult, lithium can antagonize the osmotic effect of ADH on the nephrons&#x2019; collecting ducts (Sterns, 2017d).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Water Restriction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In patients with normal or excess fluid volume, hyponatremia is usually treated effectively by restricting fluid. However, if neurologic symptoms are severe (e.g., seizures, delirium, coma), or in patients with traumatic brain injury, it may be necessary to administer small volumes of a hypertonic sodium solution with the goal of alleviating cerebral edema. Incorrect use of these fluids is extremely dangerous, because 1 L of 3% <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page241" title="241"></span>sodium chloride solution contains 513 mEq of sodium and 1 L of 5% sodium chloride solution contains 855 mEq of sodium. The recommendation for hypertonic saline administration in patients with craniocerebral trauma is 3% saline between 0.10 and 1.0 mL/kg of body weight per hour (Sterns, 2017d).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>In patients with hyponatremia, highly hypertonic sodium solutions (2&#x2013;23% sodium chloride) should be administered slowly. The patient needs close monitoring, because only small volumes are needed to elevate the serum sodium concentration.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">AVP receptor antagonists (also called ADH receptor antagonists) are pharmacologic agents that treat hyponatremia by blocking the effect of ADH at the nephron, which in turn allows diuresis to occur and leads to water excretion. Use of IV conivaptan HCl, an AVP receptor antagonist, is limited to the treatment of hospitalized patients. It may be a useful therapy for those patients with moderate to severe symptomatic hyponatremia but is contraindicated in patients with seizures, delirium, or coma, which warrants the use of hypertonic saline. Tolvaptan is an oral medication indicated for clinically significant hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia that must be initiated and monitored in the hospital setting (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2018</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s214">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse needs to identify and monitor patients at risk for hyponatremia. The nurse monitors I&#x0026;O as well as daily body weight. I&#x0026;O can be used to identify excess water input or lack of sufficient water output.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse needs to get a thorough history to identify if the patient is a performance athlete. Performance athletes (i.e., marathon runners) may use salt tablets to compensate for loss of sodium with sweating, hoping to decrease sodium loss during prolonged exercise; however, there is no evidence that this practice works and it is not recommended (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib776">Hew-Butler, Loi, Pani, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hyponatremia is a frequently overlooked cause of confusion in older patients, who are at increased risk because of decreased renal function and subsequent inability to excrete excess fluids. Administration of prescribed and OTC medications that cause sodium loss or water retention is often the predisposing factor. A diminished sense of thirst or decreased ability to access food or fluids may also contribute to the problem (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Detecting and Controlling Hyponatremia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Early detection and treatment of hyponatremia are necessary to prevent serious consequences. For patients at risk, the nurse closely monitors fluid I&#x0026;O as well as daily body weight. It is also necessary to monitor laboratory values (i.e., sodium) and be alert for GI manifestations such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping. The nurse must be alert for central nervous system changes, such as lethargy, confusion, muscle twitching, and seizures. Neurologic signs are associated with very low sodium levels that have fallen rapidly because of fluid overloading. Serum sodium is monitored very closely in patients who are at risk for hyponatremia; when indicated, urine sodium and specific gravity are also monitored.</p>
<p class="indent">For a patient with abnormal losses of sodium who can consume a general diet, the nurse encourages foods and fluids with high sodium content to control hyponatremia. For example, broth made with one beef cube contains approximately 900 mg of sodium; 8 oz of tomato juice contains approximately 700 mg of sodium. The nurse also needs to be familiar with the sodium content of parenteral fluids (see <a href="c10-sec02.xhtml#tt10-5">Table&#x00A0;10-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the primary cause of hyponatremia is water retention, it is safer to restrict fluid intake than to administer sodium. In normovolemia or hypervolemia, administration of sodium predisposes a patient to fluid volume overload. In severe hyponatremia, the aim of therapy is to elevate the serum sodium level only enough to alleviate neurologic signs and symptoms. It is generally recommended that the serum sodium concentration be increased to no greater than 125 mEq/L (125 mmol/L) with a hypertonic saline solution (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Sterns, 2020</a>).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When administering fluids to patients with cardiovascular disease, the nurse assesses for hemodynamic signs of circulatory overload (e.g., cough, dyspnea, jugular venous distention, dependent edema, 1&#x2013;2 lb weight gain in 24 h). The lungs should be auscultated for crackles as this can indicate pulmonary edema.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">For the patient taking lithium, the nurse observes for lithium toxicity, particularly when sodium is lost. In such instances, supplemental salt and fluid are given. Because diuretics promote sodium loss, the patient taking lithium is instructed not to use diuretics without close medical supervision. For all patients on lithium therapy, normal salt and oral fluid intake (approximately 6- to 15-g sodium and 2.5- to 3.0-L fluid/day) should be encouraged and a sodium restricted diet should be avoided (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2018</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Excess water supplements are avoided in patients receiving isotonic or hypotonic enteral feedings, particularly if abnormal sodium loss occurs or water is being abnormally retained (as in SIADH). Actual fluid needs are determined by evaluating fluid I&#x0026;O, urine specific gravity, and serum sodium levels.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s215">Sodium Excess (Hypernatremia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hypernatremia is a serum sodium level higher than 145 mEq/L (145 mmol/L). It can be caused by a gain of sodium in excess of water or by a loss of water in excess of sodium. It can occur in patients with normal fluid volume or in those with FVD or FVE. With water loss, the patient loses more water than sodium; as a result, the serum sodium concentration increases and the increased concentration pulls fluid out of the cell. This is both an extracellular and an intracellular FVD. In sodium excess, the patient ingests or retains more sodium than water (Mushin &#x0026; Mount, 2018; Sterns, 2017e).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Dysnatremia</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Dysnatremia is lack of normal sodium level in the bloodstream; either hypernatremia or hyponatremia. In performance athletes who lose excessive water via perspiration, sodium can become concentrated in the bloodstream causing hypernatremia. This can lead to the following life-threatening conditions:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encephalopathy</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s216">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A common cause of hypernatremia is fluid deprivation in patients who do not respond to thirst. Most often affected are patients who are very old, very young, or cognitively impaired. Administration of hypertonic enteral feedings without adequate water supplements leads to hypernatremia, as does watery diarrhea and greatly increased insensible water loss through the lungs or skin (e.g., hyperventilation, burns). In addition, diabetes insipidus, which is a lack of ADH due to posterior pituitary dysfunction, can lead to lack of adequate reabsorption of water into the bloodstream at the level of the nephron. This leads to inadequate water volume in the bloodstream which leads to hypernatremia if the patient does not respond to thirst, or if fluids are excessively restricted (Sterns, 2017c).</p>
<p class="indent">Less common causes of hypernatremia are heatstroke, nonfatal drowning in seawater (which contains a sodium concentration of approximately 500 mEq/L), and malfunction of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis systems. IV administration of hypertonic saline or excessive use of sodium bicarbonate also causes hypernatremia. Exertional dysnatremia can occur in performance athletes (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Apostu, 2014</a>) (<a href="#ct10-1">Chart&#x00A0;10-1</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s217">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical manifestations of hypernatremia are due to increased plasma osmolality caused by an increase in plasma sodium concentration. Water moves out of the cell into the ECF, resulting in cellular dehydration (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#ff10-7">Fig.&#x00A0;10-7</a>). Clinical signs and symptoms as well as laboratory findings can be found in <a href="#tt10-6">Table&#x00A0;10-6</a>. Dehydration (resulting in hypernatremia) is often overlooked as the cause of mental status and behavioral changes in older patients (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>). Body temperature may increase mildly, but it returns to normal after the hypernatremia is corrected.</p>
<p class="indent">A primary characteristic of hypernatremia is thirst. Thirst is a strong defender of normal serum sodium levels in healthy people. Because of thirst, hypernatremia does not occur unless the person is unconscious or cannot access water. However, those who are ill and older adults may have an impaired thirst mechanism (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s218">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In hypernatremia, the serum sodium level exceeds 145 mEq/L (145 mmol/L) and the serum osmolality exceeds 300 mOsm/kg (300 mmol/L). The urine specific gravity and urine osmolality are increased as the kidneys attempt to conserve water (provided the water loss is from a route other than the kidneys). Patients with diabetes insipidus do not reabsorb water into the bloodstream at the nephron. These patients consequently develop excess urine output, dehydration, and hypernatremia. Without ADH, these patients excrete very dilute urine with a urine osmolality less than 250 mOsm/kg (Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s219">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of hypernatremia consists of a gradual lowering of the serum sodium level by the infusion of a hypotonic solution (e.g., 0.45% sodium chloride) or an isotonic nonsaline solution (e.g., dextrose 5% in water [D<sub>5</sub>W]). D<sub>5</sub>W can be used when water needs to be replaced without sodium. However, hypotonic sodium chloride solution (0.45% NaCl) is thought to be safer than D<sub>5</sub>W because it allows a gradual reduction in the serum sodium level. Gradual reduction in serum sodium decreases the risk of cerebral edema. Hypotonic sodium chloride solution (0.45% NaCl) is the IV solution of choice in severe hyperglycemia with hypernatremia. A rapid reduction in the serum sodium level that occurs with D<sub>5</sub>W temporarily decreases the plasma osmolality below that of the fluid in the brain tissue, causing dangerous cerebral edema. Alternatively in hypernatremia, diuretics can be prescribed to treat the excess sodium (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Sterns &#x0026; Hoorn, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There is no consensus about the exact rate at which serum sodium levels should be reduced. As a general rule, the serum sodium level is reduced at a rate no faster than 0.5 to 1 mEq/L/h to allow sufficient time for readjustment through diffusion across fluid compartments. Desmopressin acetate, a synthetic ADH, may be prescribed to treat diabetes insipidus if it is the cause of hypernatremia (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Bichet, 2017</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Mushin &#x0026; Mount, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s220">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid losses and gains are carefully monitored in patients who are at risk for hypernatremia. The nurse should assess for abnormal losses of water or low water intake and for large gains of sodium, as might occur with ingestion of OTC medications that have a high sodium content (e.g., Alka-Seltzer). In addition, the nurse obtains a medication history, because some prescription medications have a high sodium content. The nurse also notes the patient&#x2019;s thirst or elevated body temperature and evaluates it in relation to other clinical signs and symptoms. The patient is monitored closely for changes in behavior, such as restlessness, disorientation, and lethargy (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib822">Sterns, 2017c; Sterns &#x0026; Hoorn, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Preventing Hypernatremia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse attempts to prevent hypernatremia by providing oral fluids at regular intervals, particularly in patients who are unable to perceive or respond to thirst. If fluid intake remains inadequate or the patient is unconscious, the nurse consults with the primary provider to plan an alternative route for intake, either by enteral feedings or by the parenteral route. If enteral feedings are used, sufficient water should be given to keep the serum sodium and BUN within normal limits. As a rule, the higher the osmolality of the enteral feeding, the greater is the need for water supplementation (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib763">Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018a; Sterns &#x0026; Hoorn, 2019</a>). Some herbal medications can also increase serum sodium levels.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with diabetes insipidus, adequate water intake must be ensured. If the patient is alert and has an intact thirst mechanism, merely providing access to water may be sufficient. If the patient has a decreased level of consciousness or other disability interfering with adequate fluid intake, parenteral fluid replacement may be prescribed. This therapy can be anticipated in patients with neurologic disorders, particularly in the early postoperative period (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Bichet, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Correcting Hypernatremia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When parenteral fluids are necessary for managing hypernatremia, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s response to the infusion of fluids by reviewing serial serum sodium levels and by observing for changes in neurologic status, such as confusion, disorientation, and possible decreased level of consciousness (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Mushin &#x0026; Mount, 2018</a>). With a gradual decrease in the serum sodium level, neurologic status should improve. However, too rapid reduction in the serum sodium level renders the plasma temporarily hypoosmotic compared to the intracellular fluid within the brain cells. This can cause fluid in the plasma to shift into the brain cells which can produce the dangerous state of cerebral edema (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hutto &#x0026; French, 2017</a>).</p>
