<p class="nonindent">Blisters of the skin have many origins, including bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; allergic contact reactions; burns; metabolic disorders; and immunologically mediated (i.e., autoimmune) reactions. Some of these have been discussed previously (e.g., herpes simplex and zoster infections, contact dermatitis).</p>
<p class="indent">Immunoglobulin-mediated blistering skin diseases are referred to as <em>pemphigus</em> disorders. Of these, there are five subtypes. Three of these are immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated disorders, including pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, and paraneoplastic pemphigus; the remaining two are immunoglobulin A (IgA)-mediated, and include subcorneal pustular dermatosis and intraepidermal neutrophilic dermatosis. Of these five pemphigus disorders, pemphigus vulgaris is the most common; the other four are relatively rare (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4036">Estupi&#x00F1;an &#x0026; Sandhu, 2017</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Hertl &#x0026; Sitaru, 2020</a>). Bullous pemphigoid, another type of IgG-mediated blistering disorder, has distinct characteristics that make this disease different from the pemphigus disorders. Dermatitis herpetiform is another nonpemphigus IgA-mediated blistering skin disorder that occurs as a consequence of gluten sensitivity. The diagnosis for all of these types of blistering skin disorders is made by immunofluorescent and histologic examination of a biopsy specimen (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Hertl &#x0026; Sitaru, 2020</a>).</p>
