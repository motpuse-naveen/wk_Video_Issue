<p class="nonindent">Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome usually characterized by episodes or paroxysms of pain or pressure in the anterior chest. The cause is insufficient coronary blood flow, resulting in a decreased oxygen supply when there is increased myocardial demand for oxygen in response to physical exertion or emotional stress. In other words, the need for oxygen exceeds the supply.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s840">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic disease and most often is associated with a significant obstruction of at least one major coronary artery. Normally, the myocardium extracts a large amount of oxygen from the coronary circulation to meet its continuous demands. When demand increases, flow through the coronary arteries needs to be increased. When there is a blockage in a coronary artery, flow cannot be increased and ischemia results. The types of angina are listed in <a href="#ct23-2">Chart 23-2</a>. Several factors are associated with typical anginal pain:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Physical exertion, which precipitates an attack by increasing myocardial oxygen demand</span></li>
<li><span>Exposure to cold, which causes vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure, with increased oxygen demand</span></li>
<li><span>Eating a heavy meal, which increases the blood flow to the mesenteric area for digestion, thereby reducing the blood supply available to the heart muscle; in a severely compromised heart, shunting of blood for digestion can be sufficient to induce anginal pain</span></li></ul>

</div>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Stress or any emotion-provoking situation, causing the release of catecholamines, which increases blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial workload</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Unstable angina is not closely associated with these listed factors. It may occur at rest (see later discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s841">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ischemia of the heart muscle may produce pain or other symptoms, varying from mild indigestion to a choking or heavy sensation in the upper chest. The severity ranges from discomfort to agonizing pain. The pain may be accompanied by severe apprehension and a feeling of impending death. It is often felt deep in the chest behind the sternum (retrosternal area). Typically, the pain or discomfort is poorly localized and may radiate to the neck, jaw, shoulders, and inner aspects of the upper arms, usually the left arm. The patient often feels tightness or a heavy choking or strangling sensation that has a viselike, insistent quality. The patient with diabetes may not have severe pain with angina because autonomic neuropathy can blunt nociceptor transmission, dulling the perception of pain (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A feeling of weakness or numbness in the arms, wrists, and hands, as well as shortness of breath, pallor, diaphoresis, dizziness or lightheadedness, and nausea and vomiting, may accompany the pain. An important characteristic of angina is that it subsides with rest or administration of nitroglycerin. In many patients, anginal symptoms follow a stable, predictable pattern.</p>
<p class="indent">Unstable angina is characterized by attacks that increase in frequency and severity and are not relieved by rest and administration of nitroglycerin. Patients with unstable angina require medical intervention.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The older adult with angina may not exhibit a typical pain profile because of the diminished pain transmission that can occur with aging. Often the presenting symptom in older adults is dyspnea. Sometimes there are no symptoms (&#x201C;silent&#x201D; CAD), making recognition and diagnosis a clinical challenge. Older patients should be encouraged to recognize their chest pain&#x2013;like symptom (e.g., weakness) as an indication that they should rest or take prescribed medications. Pharmacologic stress testing and cardiac catheterization may be used to diagnose CAD in older patients. Medications used to manage angina are given cautiously in older adults because they are associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). Invasive procedures (e.g., PCI) that were once considered too risky in older adults are now being performed successfully, and many older adults benefit from symptom relief and longer survival (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Lattuca, Kerneis, &#x0026; Zeitouni, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s842">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of angina begins with the patient&#x2019;s history related to the clinical manifestations of ischemia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) may show changes indicative of ischemia, such as T-wave inversion, ST-segment elevation, or the development of an abnormal Q wave (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). Laboratory studies are performed; these generally include cardiac biomarker testing to rule out ACS (see later discussion). The patient may undergo an exercise or pharmacologic stress test in which the heart is monitored continuously by an ECG, echocardiogram, or both. The patient may also be referred for a nuclear scan or invasive procedure (e.g., cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s843">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of the medical management of angina are to decrease the oxygen demand of the myocardium and to increase the oxygen supply. Medically, these objectives are met through pharmacologic therapy and control of risk factors. Alternatively, reperfusion procedures may be used to restore the blood supply to the myocardium. These include PCI procedures (e.g., percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA] and intracoronary stents) and CABG (see later discussion).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><a href="#tt23-2">Table 23-2</a> summarizes drug therapy.</p>
<p class="h7">Nitroglycerin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nitrates are a standard treatment for angina pectoris. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that improves blood flow to the heart muscle and relieves pain. Nitroglycerin dilates primarily the veins and, to a lesser extent, the arteries. Dilation of the veins causes venous pooling of blood throughout the body. As a result, less blood returns to the heart, and filling pressure (preload) is reduced. If the patient is hypovolemic (does not have adequate circulating blood volume), the decrease in filling pressure can cause a significant decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nitrates also relax the systemic arteriolar bed, lowering blood pressure and decreasing afterload. These effects decrease myocardial oxygen requirements, bringing about a more favorable balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="indent">Nitroglycerin may be given by several routes: sublingual tablet or spray, oral capsule, topical agent, and intravenous (IV) administration. Sublingual nitroglycerin is generally placed under the tongue or in the cheek (buccal pouch) and ideally alleviates the pain of ischemia within 3 minutes. <a href="#ct23-3">Chart 23-3</a> provides more information on self-administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Oral preparations and topical patches are used to provide sustained effects. A regimen in which the patches are applied in the morning and removed at bedtime allows for a nitrate-free period to prevent the development of tolerance.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">A continuous or intermittent IV infusion of nitroglycerin may be given to the hospitalized patient with recurring signs and symptoms of ischemia or after a revascularization procedure. The rate of infusion is titrated to the patient&#x2019;s pain level and blood pressure. It usually is not given if the systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. Generally, after the patient is symptom-free, the nitroglycerin may be switched to an oral or topical preparation within 24 hours. A common adverse effect of nitroglycerin is headache, which may limit the use of this drug in some patients.</p>
<p class="h7">Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Beta-blockers such as metoprolol reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by blocking beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation to the heart. The result is a reduction in heart rate, slowed conduction of impulses through the conduction system, decreased blood pressure, and reduced myocardial <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;contractility:&lt;/b&gt; ability of the cardiac muscle to shorten in response to an electrical impulse">contractility</button></strong> (force of contraction). Because of these effects, beta-blockers balance the myocardial oxygen needs (demands) and the amount of oxygen available (supply). This helps control chest pain and delays the onset of ischemia during work or exercise. Beta-blockers reduce the incidence of recurrent angina, infarction, and cardiac mortality. The dose can be titrated to achieve a resting heart rate of 50 to 60 bpm (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiac side effects and possible contraindications include hypotension, bradycardia, advanced atrioventricular block, and acute heart failure. If a beta-blocker is given IV for an acute cardiac event, the ECG, blood pressure, and heart rate are monitored closely after the medication has been given. Side effects include depressed mood, fatigue, decreased libido, and dizziness. Patients taking beta-blockers are cautioned not to stop taking them abruptly, because angina may worsen, and MI may develop. Beta-blocker therapy should be decreased gradually over several days before being discontinued. Patients with diabetes who take beta-blockers are instructed to monitor their blood glucose levels as prescribed because beta-blockers can mask signs of hypoglycemia. Beta-blockers that are not cardioselective also affect the beta-adrenergic receptors in the bronchioles, causing bronchoconstriction, and therefore are contraindicated in patients with significant chronic pulmonary disorders, such as asthma.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box12pTitlen">Self-Administration of Nitroglycerin</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Most patients with angina pectoris self-administer nitroglycerin on an as-needed basis. A key nursing role in such cases is educating patients about the medication and how to take it. Sublingual nitroglycerin comes in tablet and spray forms.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Instruct the patient to make sure that the mouth is moist, the tongue is still, and saliva is not swallowed until the nitroglycerin tablet dissolves. If the pain is severe, the patient can crush the tablet between the teeth to hasten sublingual absorption.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Advise the patient to carry the medication at all times as a precaution. However, because nitroglycerin is very unstable, it should be carried securely in its original container (e.g., capped dark glass bottle); tablets should never be removed and stored in metal or plastic pillboxes.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Explain that nitroglycerin is volatile and is inactivated by heat, moisture, air, light, and time. Instruct the patient to renew the nitroglycerin supply every 6 months.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inform the patient that the medication should be taken in anticipation of any activity that may produce pain. Because nitroglycerin increases tolerance for exercise and stress when taken prophylactically (i.e., before angina-producing activity, such as exercise, stair-climbing, or sexual intercourse), it is best taken before pain develops.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recommend that the patient note how long it takes for the nitroglycerin to relieve the discomfort. Advise the patient that if pain persists after taking three sublingual tablets at 5-minute intervals, emergency medical services should be called.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Discuss possible side effects of nitroglycerin, including flushing, throbbing headache, hypotension, and tachycardia.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Advise the patient to sit down for a few minutes when taking nitroglycerin to avoid hypotension and syncope.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Calcium Channel Blocking Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Calcium channel blockers have a variety of effects on the ischemic myocardium. These agents decrease sinoatrial node automaticity and atrioventricular node conduction, resulting in a slower heart rate and a decrease in the strength of myocardial contraction (negative inotropic effect). These effects decrease the workload of the heart. Calcium channel blockers also increase myocardial oxygen supply by dilating the smooth muscle wall of the coronary arterioles; they decrease myocardial oxygen demand by reducing systemic arterial pressure and the workload of the left ventricle (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). The calcium channel blockers most commonly used are amlodipine and diltiazem. In addition to their use to treat angina, they are commonly prescribed for hypertension. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page735" title="735"></span>Hypotension may occur after the administration of any of the calcium channel blockers, particularly when administered IV. Other side effects may include atrioventricular block, bradycardia, and constipation.</p>
<p class="h7">Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Antiplatelet medications are given to prevent platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombosis, which impedes blood flow through the coronary arteries.</p>
<p class="h8">Aspirin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Aspirin prevents platelet aggregation and reduces the incidence of MI and death in patients with CAD (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). A 162- to 325-mg dose of aspirin should be given to the patient with a new diagnosis of angina and then continued with 81 to 325 mg daily. Patients should be advised to continue aspirin even if they concurrently take other analgesics such as acetaminophen. Because aspirin may cause GI upset and bleeding, the use of histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) blockers (e.g., famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) should be considered concomitant with continued aspirin therapy (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1761">Ibanez, James, Agewall, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Antagonists (P2Y<sub>12</sub>)</p>
<p class="nonindent">These medications act on different pathways than aspirin to block platelet activation. However, unlike aspirin, these agents may take a few days to achieve antiplatelet effects. Clopidogrel is commonly prescribed in addition to aspirin in patients at high risk for MI. Newer oral agents such as prasugrel and ticagrelor may be used in place of clopidogrel during coronary events and interventions (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). Both carry the risk of bleeding from the GI tract or other sites.</p>
<p class="h8">Heparin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Unfractionated IV heparin prevents the formation of new blood clots (i.e., it is an anticoagulant). Treating patients with unstable angina with heparin reduces the occurrence of MI. If the patient&#x2019;s signs and symptoms indicate a significant risk for a cardiac event, the patient is hospitalized and may be given an IV bolus of heparin and started on a continuous infusion. The dose of heparin given is based on the results of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Heparin therapy is usually considered therapeutic when the aPTT is 2 to 2.5 times the normal aPTT value.</p>
<p class="indent">A subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin or dalteparin) may be used instead of IV unfractionated heparin to treat patients with unstable angina or non&#x2013;ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). LMWH provides effective and stable anticoagulation, potentially reducing the risk of rebound ischemic events, and eliminating the need to monitor aPTT results. LMWHs may be beneficial before and during PCIs as well as for ACS.</p>
<p class="indent">Because unfractionated heparin and LMWH increase the risk of bleeding, the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of external and internal bleeding, such as low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased serum hemoglobin and hematocrit. The patient receiving heparin is placed on bleeding precautions, which include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Applying pressure to the site of any needle puncture for a longer time than usual</span></li>
<li><span>Avoiding intramuscular (IM) injections</span></li>
<li><span>Avoiding tissue injury and bruising from trauma or use of constrictive devices (e.g., continuous use of an automatic blood pressure cuff)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">A decrease in platelet count or evidence of thrombosis may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an antibody-mediated reaction to heparin that may result in thrombosis. Patients who have received heparin within the past 3 months and those who have been receiving unfractionated heparin for 4 to 14 days are at high risk for HIT (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). As an alternative to LMWH and unfractionated heparin, argatroban, a direct antithrombotic agent might be prescribed (Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021; see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for further discussion of HIT).</p>
<p class="h8">Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">IV administration of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa agents, such as abciximab or eptifibatide, is indicated for hospitalized patients with unstable angina and as adjunct therapy for PCI. These agents prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the GP IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelets, preventing adhesion of fibrinogen and other factors that crosslink platelets to each other and thus form intracoronary clots (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Urden, Stacy, &#x0026; Lough, 2019</a>). As with heparin, bleeding is the major side effect, and bleeding precautions should be initiated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Oxygen Administration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen therapy is usually initiated at the onset of chest pain in an attempt to increase the amount of oxygen delivered to the myocardium and to decrease pain. The therapeutic effectiveness of oxygen is determined by observing the rate and rhythm of respirations and the color of skin and mucous membranes. Blood oxygen saturation is monitored by pulse oximetry; the normal oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) level is &#x003E;95% on room air (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>ACS and/or MI (described later in this chapter)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest (see Chapters 22 and 25)</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cardiogenic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>)</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Major patient goals include immediate and appropriate treatment when angina occurs, prevention of angina, reduction of anxiety, awareness of the disease process and understanding of the prescribed care, adherence to the self-care program, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>T<span class="small">REATING</span> A<span class="small">NGINA</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">If the patient reports pain (or cardiac ischemia is suggested by prodromal symptoms, which may include sensations of indigestion or nausea, choking, heaviness, weakness or numbness in the upper extremities, dyspnea, or dizziness), the nurse takes immediate action. The patient experiencing angina is directed to stop all activities and sit or rest in bed in a semi-Fowler position to reduce the oxygen requirements of the ischemic myocardium. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s angina, asking questions to determine whether the angina is the same as the patient typically experiences. A change may indicate a worsening of the disease or a different cause. The nurse then continues to assess the patient, measuring vital signs and observing for signs of respiratory distress. If the patient is in the hospital, a 12-lead ECG is usually obtained and assessed for ST-segment and T-wave changes. If the patient has been placed on cardiac monitoring with continuous ST-segment monitoring, the ST segment is assessed for changes.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nitroglycerin is given sublingually, and the patient&#x2019;s response is assessed (relief of chest pain and effect on blood pressure and heart rate). If the chest pain is unchanged or is lessened but still present, nitroglycerin administration is repeated up to three doses. Each time blood pressure, heart rate, and the ST segment (if the patient is on a monitor with ST-segment monitoring capability) are assessed. The nurse administers oxygen therapy if the patient&#x2019;s respiratory rate is increased or if the oxygen saturation level is decreased. Oxygen is usually given at 2 L/min by nasal cannula, even without evidence of desaturation, although there is no current evidence of a positive effect on patient outcome. If the pain is significant and continues after these interventions, the patient is further evaluated for acute MI and may be transferred to a higher-acuity nursing unit (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1761">Ibanez et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EDUCING</span> A<span class="small">NXIETY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients with angina often fear loss of their roles within society and the family. They may also fear that the pain (or the prodromal symptoms) may lead to an MI or death. Exploring the implications that the diagnosis has for the patient and providing information about the illness, its treatment, and methods of preventing its progression are important nursing interventions. Various stress reduction methods, such as guided imagery or music therapy, should be explored with the patient (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Meghani, 2017</a>). Addressing the spiritual needs of the patient and family may also assist in allaying anxieties and fears.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> P<span class="small">AIN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse reviews the assessment findings, identifies the level of activity that causes the patient&#x2019;s pain or prodromal symptoms, and plans the patient&#x2019;s activities accordingly. If the patient has pain frequently or with minimal activity, the nurse alternates the patient&#x2019;s activities with rest periods. Balancing activity and rest is an important aspect of the educational plan for the patient and family.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="yellon">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The program for educating the patient with angina is designed so that the patient and family understand the illness, identify the symptoms of myocardial ischemia, state the actions to take when symptoms develop, and discuss methods to prevent chest pain and the advancement of CAD. The goals of education are to reduce the frequency and severity of anginal attacks, to delay the progress of the underlying disease if possible, and to prevent complications. The factors outlined in <a href="#ct23-5">Chart 23-5</a> are important in educating the patient with angina pectoris.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The self-care program is prepared in collaboration with the patient and family or friends. Activities should be planned to minimize the occurrence of anginal episodes. The patient needs to understand that any pain unrelieved within 15 minutes by the usual methods, including nitroglycerin (see <a href="#ct23-3">Chart 23-3</a>), should be treated at the closest ED; the patient should call 911 for assistance.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4n"><span class="yellon">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> For patient with disability or special needs, arrangements are made for transitional, home, or community care when appropriate. A home health or transitional care nurse can assist the patient with scheduling and keeping follow-up appointments. The patient may need reminders about follow-up monitoring, including periodic laboratory testing. In addition, the home health nurse may monitor the patient&#x2019;s adherence to dietary restrictions and to prescribed antianginal medications, including nitroglycerin. If the patient has severe anginal symptoms, the nurse may assess the home environment and recommend modifications that diminish the occurrence of anginal episodes. For instance, if a patient cannot climb stairs without experiencing ischemia, the home health nurse may help the patient plan daily activities that minimize stair-climbing.</p>
