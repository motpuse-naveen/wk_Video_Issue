<p class="nonindent">The number of deaths attributable to ketoacidosis and infection in patients with diabetes has steadily declined, but diabetes related complications have increased. Long-term complications are becoming more common as more people live longer with diabetes; these complications can affect almost every organ system of the body and are a major cause of disability. The general categories of long-term diabetic complications are macrovascular disease, microvascular disease, and neuropathy.</p>
<p class="indent">The causes and pathogenesis of each type of complication are still being investigated. However, it appears that increased levels of blood glucose play a role in neuropathic disease, microvascular complications, and risk factors contributing to macrovascular complications. Hypertension may also be a major contributing factor, especially in macrovascular and microvascular diseases (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Long-term complications are seen in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes but usually do not occur within the first 5 to 10&#x00A0;years after diagnosis. However, evidence of these complications may be present at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, because patients may have had undiagnosed diabetes for many years. Kidney (microvascular) disease is more prevalent in patients with type 1 diabetes, and cardiovascular (macrovascular) complications are more prevalent in older patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
