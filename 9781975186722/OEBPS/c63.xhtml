<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">autonomic dysreflexia:</span> a life-threatening emergency in patients with spinal cord injury that causes a hypertensive emergency (<em>synonym:</em> autonomic hyperreflexia)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">complete spinal cord lesion:</span> a condition that involves total loss of sensation and voluntary muscle control below the lesion</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">concussion:</span> a temporary loss of neurologic function with no apparent structural damage to the brain</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">contusion:</span> bruising of the brain surface</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">incomplete spinal cord lesion:</span> a condition in which there is preservation of the sensory or motor fibers, or both, below the lesion</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">neurogenic bladder:</span> bladder dysfunction that results from a disorder or dysfunction of the nervous system; may result in either urinary retention or bladder overactivity</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">paraplegia:</span> paralysis of the lower extremities with dysfunction of the bowel and bladder from a lesion in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral region of the spinal cord</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">primary injury:</span> initial damage to the brain that results from the traumatic event</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">secondary injury:</span> an insult to the brain subsequent to the original traumatic event</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">spinal cord injury (SCI):</span> an injury to the spinal cord, vertebral column, supporting soft tissue, or intervertebral discs caused by trauma</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">tetraplegia:</span> varying degrees of paralysis of both arms and legs, with dysfunction of bowel and bladder from a lesion of the cervical segments of the spinal cord; formerly called <em>quadriplegia</em></p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">transection:</span> severing of the spinal cord; transection can be complete (all the way through the cord) or incomplete (partially through)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">traumatic brain injury:</span> an injury to the skull or brain that is severe enough to interfere with normal functioning (<em>synonym:</em> craniocerebral trauma)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">traumatic brain injury, closed (blunt):</span> occurs when the head accelerates and then rapidly decelerates or collides with another object and brain tissue is damaged, but there is no opening through the skull and dura</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">traumatic brain injury, open (penetrating):</span> occurs when an object penetrates the skull, enters the brain, and damages the soft brain tissue in its path (penetrating injury), or when blunt trauma to the head is so severe that it opens the scalp, skull, and dura to expose the brain</p>

<p class="nonindent">Trauma involving the central nervous system can be life-threatening. Even if not life-threatening, brain and spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in major physical and psychological dysfunction and can alter the patient&#x2019;s life completely. Neurologic trauma affects the patient, the family, the health care system, and the society as a whole because of its major sequelae and the costs of acute and long-term care of patients with trauma to the brain and spinal cord.</p>
