<h4 class="h4" id="s1298">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnostic evaluation of the patient with allergic disorders commonly includes blood tests, smears of body secretions, skin tests, and the serum-specific IgE test (formerly known as radioallergosorbent test [RAST]). Results of laboratory blood studies provide supportive data for various diagnostic possibilities; however, they are not the major criteria for the diagnosis of allergic disease (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1299">Complete Blood Count with Differential</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The white blood cell (WBC) count is usually within normal limits except when infection and inflammation are present along with an allergic disorder. Eosinophils, which are granular leukocytes, normally make up 2% to 5% of the total number of WBCs. They can be found in blood, sputum, and nasal secretions. A level greater than 5% to 10% is considered abnormal and may be found in patients with allergic disorders (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1300">Eosinophil Count</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An actual count of eosinophils can be obtained from blood samples or smears of secretions. During symptomatic episodes, smears obtained from nasal secretions and sputum of patients with allergies usually reveal an increase in eosinophils, indicating an active allergic response (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1301">Total Serum Immunoglobulin E Levels</h5>
<p class="nonindent">High total serum IgE levels support the diagnosis of allergic disease. In the majority of cases, the antibody typically responsible for an allergic reaction belongs to the IgE isotype. Patients with this disorder are said to have an IgE-mediated allergic disease (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1302">Skin Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Skin testing entails the intradermal injection or superficial application (epicutaneous) of solutions at several sites. Depending on the suspected cause of allergic signs and symptoms, many different solutions may be applied at separate sites. These solutions contain individual antigens representing an assortment of allergens most likely to be implicated in the patient&#x2019;s disease. Positive (wheal-and-flare) reactions are clinically significant when correlated with the history, physical findings, and results of other laboratory tests. Skin testing is considered the most accurate confirmation of allergy (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The results of skin tests complement the data obtained from the history. They indicate which of several antigens are most likely to provoke symptoms and indicate the intensity of the patient&#x2019;s sensitization. The dosage of the antigen (allergen) injected is also important. Most patients are hypersensitive to more than one allergen. Under testing conditions, they may not react (although they usually do) to the specific allergens that induce their attacks.</p>
<p class="indent">When there is doubt about the validity of the skin tests, a serum-specific IgE test or a provocative challenge test may be performed. If a skin test is indicated, there is a reasonable suspicion that a specific allergen is producing symptoms in a patient with allergies. However, several precautionary steps must be observed before skin testing with allergens is performed:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Testing is not performed during periods of bronchospasm.</span></li>
<li><span>Epicutaneous tests (scratch or prick tests) are performed before other testing methods, in an effort to minimize the risk of systemic reaction.</span></li>
<li><span>Emergency equipment must be readily available to treat anaphylaxis.</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Types of Skin Tests</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The methods of skin testing include prick skin tests, scratch tests, and intradermal skin testing. After negative prick or scratch tests, intradermal skin testing is performed with allergens that are suggested by the patient&#x2019;s history to be problematic. The back is the most suitable area of the body for skin testing because it permits the performance of many tests. A multitest applicator with multiple test heads is commercially available <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1045" title="1045"></span>for simultaneous administration of antigens by multiple punctures at different sites. Research suggests that use of a multi-prong applicator for allergy testing decreases patient discomfort and application time (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2432">Pestotnik &#x0026; Krueger, 2018</a>). A negative response on a skin test cannot be interpreted as an absence of sensitivity to an allergen. Such a response may occur with insufficient sensitivity of the test or with the use of an inappropriate allergen in testing. Therefore, it is essential to observe the patient undergoing skin testing for an allergic reaction even if the previous response was negative (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Interpretation of Skin Test Results</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Familiarity with and consistent use of a grading system are essential. The grading system used should be identified on a skin test record for later interpretation. A positive reaction, evidenced by the appearance of an urticarial wheal (round, reddened skin elevation) (see <a href="#ff33-3">Fig. 33-3</a>), localized <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythema:&lt;/b&gt; diffuse redness of the skin">erythema</button></strong> (diffuse redness) in the area of inoculation or contact, or pseudopodia (irregular projection at the end of a wheal) with associated erythema is considered indicative of sensitivity to the corresponding antigen. False-positive results may occur because of improper preparation or administration of allergen solutions (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Corticosteroids and antihistamines, including over-the-counter allergy medications, suppress skin test reactivity and should be stopped 48 to 96 hours before testing, depending on the duration of their activity.

<p class="indent">Positive or negative skin tests are interpreted in the context of a patient&#x2019;s history, clinical signs, and exposure to allergens. The following guidelines are used for the interpretation of skin test results:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Skin tests are used most frequently with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.</span></li>
<li><span>Negative test results are helpful in ruling out food allergy.</span></li>
<li><span>Positive skin tests correlate highly with food allergy.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The use of skin tests to diagnose immediate hypersensitivity to medications is limited, because metabolites of medications, not the medications themselves, are usually responsible for causing hypersensitivity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1303">Provocative Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Provocative testing involves the direct administration of the suspected allergen to the sensitive tissue, such as the conjunctiva, nasal or bronchial mucosa, or gastrointestinal tract (by ingestion of the allergen), with observation of target organ response. This type of testing is helpful in identifying clinically significant allergens in patients who have a large number of positive tests. Major disadvantages of this type of testing are the limitation of one antigen per session and the risk of producing severe symptoms, particularly bronchospasm, in patients with asthma (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1304">Serum-Specific IgE Test</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The serum-specific IgE test, formerly known as RAST, is an automated test performed on blood samples by a pathology laboratory. As the name suggests, it detects free antigen-specific IgE in serum as opposed to antigen-specific IgE bound to mast cells in the skin. The advantages of this test over other tests include decreased risk of systemic reaction, stability of antigens, and lack of dependence on skin reactivity modified by medications. The major disadvantages include limited allergen selection and reduced sensitivity compared with intradermal skin tests, lack of immediate results, and higher cost (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kowal &#x0026; DuBuske, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec3">ALLERGIC DISORDERS</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are two types of IgE-mediated allergic reactions: atopic and nonatopic disorders. Although the underlying immunologic reactions of the two types of disorders are the same, the predisposing factors and manifestations are different. Atopy is defined as the genetic predisposition to mount an IgE response to inhaled or ingested innocuous proteins. Atopic diseases consist of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. All share a common pathogenesis, mediated by IgE, and are frequently present together in the same individual and in families. The nonatopic disorders lack the genetic component and organ specificity of the atopic disorders. Latex allergy (see later discussion) can present as an IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, type I reaction, or a type IV hypersensitivity referred to as contact dermatitis (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Stokes &#x0026; Casale, 2019</a>).</p>
