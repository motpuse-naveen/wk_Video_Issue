<h4 class="h4" id="s1190">Protein S Deficiency</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Protein S is another natural anticoagulant normally produced by the liver. APC requires protein S to inactivate certain clotting factors. When the level of protein S is deficient, this inactivation process is diminished and the risk of thrombosis increases. As with protein C deficiency, patients with protein S deficiency have a greater risk for recurrent venous thrombosis early in life, including risk for PE (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Bunn &#x0026; Bauer, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Thromboses frequently occur in axillary, mesenteric, and cerebral veins. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is also possible with protein S deficiency. A number of conditions may lead to acquired protein S deficiency including pregnancy, DIC, liver disease, nephritic syndrome, HIV infection, and the use of L-asparaginase.</p>
