<h5 class="h5" id="s2721">Ocular History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse, through careful questioning, elicits the necessary information that can assist in diagnosis of an ophthalmic condition. Pertinent questions to ask when taking an ocular history are presented in <a href="#ct58-1">Chart 58-1</a>. Genetics may play a role in the causation and progression of eye and vision disorders (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Singh &#x0026; Tyagi, 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ct58-2">Chart 58-2</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2722">Visual Acuity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Following the health history, the patient&#x2019;s visual acuity is assessed. This is an essential part of the eye examination and a measure against which all therapeutic outcomes are based.</p>
<p class="indent">Visual acuity is tested for both near (14 inches away) and distance (20 feet away) vision and is performed on each eye separately with a standardized Snellen chart for distance and a Rosenbaum pocket screener for near vision. A tumbling &#x201C;E,&#x201D; &#x201C;illiterate E,&#x201D; number, or picture chart is used if the person is illiterate or unable to read the English alphabet (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The Snellen chart is composed of a series of progressively smaller rows of letters; the person is asked to read the lowest line possible. The fraction 20/20 is considered the standard of normal vision. Most people can see the letters on the line designated as 20/20. The patient should be encouraged to read every letter possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Visual acuity is then recorded. Common abbreviations related to vision and eye health are derived from Latin terms; these include OD (<em>oculus dexter,</em> right eye), OS (<em>oculus sinister,</em> left eye), and OU (<em>oculus uterque,</em> both eyes). The following would be an example of visual acuity documentation: A patient reads all five letters from the 20/20 line on the Snellen chart with the right eye (OD) and three of the five letters on the 20/30 line with the left eye (OS); the visual acuity is documented as OD: 20/20 and OS: 20/30 (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient cannot see the big &#x201C;E&#x201D; at the top of the Snellen chart, the examiner should determine next if the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1901" title="1901"></span>patient can count fingers (&#x201C;CF&#x201D; in documentation). Initially, the examiner stands 5 feet from the person, holds up a random number of fingers, and then asks the patient to count the number of fingers seen. If the patient is unable to count fingers at 5 feet, the examiner keeps moving a foot closer until either 1 foot away or the person can correctly count fingers. If the patient correctly counts the number of fingers at 3 feet, for example, the examiner would record vision as CF/3 feet.</p>

<p class="indent">If the patient cannot count fingers, the examiner raises one hand up and down or moves it side to side and asks in which direction the hand is moving. This level of vision is known as hand motion. A patient who can perceive only light is described as having light perception. The vision of a patient who cannot perceive light is described as no light perception.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2723">External Eye Examination</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse uses a systematic approach to perform an external eye examination by first assessing for symmetry and placement of eyelids, pupils, and muscles. CNs III, IV, and VI control movement and pupil size. The eyelids should rest just above and below the corneal limbus without exposure of the sclera. The nurse observes for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ptosis:&lt;/b&gt; drooping eyelid">ptosis</button></strong> (drooping of the eyelid), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ectropion:&lt;/b&gt; turning out of the lower eyelid">ectropion</button></strong> (turning out of the lower eyelid), or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;entropion:&lt;/b&gt; turning in of the lower eyelid">entropion</button></strong> (turning in of the lower eyelid). Entropion may involve <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;trichiasis:&lt;/b&gt; turning in of the eyelashes">trichiasis</button></strong> (turning in of the eyelashes). Eyelids and lashes should be free of drainage or scaling.</p>
<p class="indent">The room should be darkened so that the pupils can be examined. The pupillary response is checked with a penlight to determine if the pupils are equally reactive and regular. A normal pupil is black. An irregular pupil may result from trauma, previous surgery, or a disease process.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s eyes are observed in primary or direct gaze, and any head tilt is noted. A head tilt may indicate CN palsy. The patient is asked to stare at a target; each eye is covered and uncovered quickly while the examiner looks for any shift in gaze. The examiner observes for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nystagmus:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary oscillation of the eyeball">nystagmus</button></strong> (involuntary oscillating movement of the eyeball). The extraocular movements of the eyes are tested by having the patient follow the examiner&#x2019;s finger, pencil, or a hand light through the six cardinal directions of gaze (i.e., up, down, right, left, and both diagonals).</p>
