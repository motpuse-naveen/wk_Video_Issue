<h4 class="h4" id="s234">Calcium Imbalances</h4>
<p class="nonindent">More than 99% of the body&#x2019;s calcium (Ca<sup>++</sup>) is located in the skeletal system; it is a major component of bones and teeth. About 1% of skeletal calcium is rapidly exchangeable with blood calcium, and the rest is more stable and only slowly exchanged. The small amount of calcium located outside the bone circulates in the serum, partly bound to protein and partly ionized. Calcium plays a major role in transmitting nerve impulses and helps regulate muscle contraction and relaxation, including cardiac muscle. Calcium is instrumental in activating enzymes that stimulate many essential chemical reactions in the body, and it also plays a role in blood coagulation. Because many factors affect calcium regulation, both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia are relatively common disturbances (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>) (<a href="#tt10-8">Table&#x00A0;10-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The normal adult total serum calcium level is 8.8 to 10.4 mg/dL (2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L) (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Calcium exists in plasma in three forms: ionized, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page248" title="248"></span>bound, and complex. Approximately 50% of the serum calcium exists in a physiologically active ionized form that is important for neuromuscular activity and blood coagulation; this is the only physiologically and clinically significant form. The normal ionized serum calcium level is 4.5 to 5.1 mg/dL (1.1 to 1.3 mmol/L). Less than half of the plasma calcium is bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin. The remainder is combined with nonprotein anions: phosphate, citrate, and carbonate (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hogan &#x0026; Goldfarb, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Calcium is absorbed from foods in the presence of normal gastric acidity and vitamin D. It is excreted primarily in the feces, with the remainder excreted in the urine. The serum calcium level is controlled by PTH and calcitonin. As ionized serum calcium decreases in the bloodstream, the parathyroid glands secrete PTH. This, in turn, increases calcium absorption from the GI tract, increases calcium reabsorption from the renal tubule, and releases calcium from the bone. The resultant increase in calcium ion concentration in the bloodstream then suppresses PTH secretion. When calcium increases excessively, the thyroid gland secretes calcitonin, which inhibits calcium reabsorption from bone and decreases the serum calcium concentration (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s235">Calcium Deficit (Hypocalcemia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hypocalcemia (serum calcium value lower than 8.8 mg/dL [2.20 mmol/L]) occurs in a variety of clinical situations. A patient may have a total-body calcium deficit (as in osteoporosis) but a normal serum calcium level. Older adults and those with disability have an increased risk of hypocalcemia because immobility, particularly lack of weight-bearing activity, increases bone resorption (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Goltzman, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s236">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The parathyroid glands are instrumental in regulating blood and body calcium levels. Several factors can cause hypocalcemia, including primary hypoparathyroidism and surgical hypoparathyroidism. Surgical hypoparathyroidism is more common as a result of unintentional trauma or devascularization of the parathyroid glands (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Kazaure &#x0026; Sosa, 2018</a>). Not only is hypocalcemia associated with thyroid and parathyroid surgery, but it can also occur after radical neck dissection and is most likely in the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Transient hypocalcemia can occur with massive administration of citrated blood (i.e., massive hemorrhage and shock), because citrate can combine with ionized calcium and temporarily remove it from the circulation (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Goltzman, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Inflammation of the pancreas causes the breakdown of proteins and lipids. It is thought that calcium ions combine with the fatty acids released by lipolysis, forming soaplike compounds. As a result of this process, hypocalcemia occurs and is common in pancreatitis. Hypocalcemia may also be related to excessive secretion of glucagon from the inflamed pancreas, which results in increased secretion of calcitonin from the thyroid gland.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypocalcemia is common in patients with acute kidney injury, because these patients frequently have elevated serum phosphate levels. Hyperphosphatemia usually causes a reciprocal drop in the serum calcium level. Other causes of hypocalcemia include inadequate vitamin D consumption, magnesium deficiency, medullary thyroid carcinoma, low serum albumin levels, alkalosis, and alcohol abuse. Medications predisposing to hypocalcemia include aluminum-containing antacids, aminoglycosides, caffeine, cisplatin, corticosteroids, mithramycin, phosphates, isoniazid, loop diuretics, and proton pump inhibitors (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Goltzman, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s237">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tetany, the most characteristic manifestation of hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, refers to the entire symptom complex induced by increased neural excitability. Clinical signs and symptoms are caused by spontaneous discharges of both sensory and motor fibers in peripheral nerves and are outlined in <a href="#tt10-8">Table&#x00A0;10-8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Chvostek sign (<a href="#ff10-9">Fig.&#x00A0;10-9</a>A) consists of twitching of muscles innervated by the facial nerve in response to tapping of the muscle just below the zygomatic arch. Trousseau sign (<a href="#ff10-9">Fig.&#x00A0;10-9</a>B) can be elicited by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to about 20 mm Hg above systolic pressure; within 2 to 5 minutes, carpal spasm will occur as ischemia of the ulnar nerve develops (Goltzman, 2019a).</p>

<p class="indent">Hypocalcemia can cause seizures because low calcium levels increase irritability of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Other changes associated with hypocalcemia include mental changes such as depression, impaired memory, confusion, delirium, and hallucinations. A prolonged QT interval is seen on the ECG due to prolongation of the ST segment, and torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia, may occur. Respiratory effects with decreasing calcium include dyspnea and laryngospasm. Signs and symptoms of chronic hypocalcemia include hyperactive bowel sounds, dry and brittle hair and nails, and abnormal clotting (Goltzman, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Osteoporosis is associated with prolonged low intake of calcium and represents a total-body calcium deficit, even though serum calcium levels are usually normal. This disorder occurs in millions of Americans and is most common in postmenopausal women. It is characterized by loss of bone mass, which causes bones to become porous and brittle and therefore susceptible to fracture (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Black &#x0026; Rosen, 2016</a>) (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for further discussion of osteoporosis).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s238">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When evaluating serum calcium levels, the serum albumin level and the arterial pH must also be considered. Because abnormalities in serum albumin levels may affect interpretation of the serum calcium level, it may be necessary to calculate the corrected serum calcium if the serum albumin level is abnormal. For every decrease in serum albumin of 1 g/dL below 4 g/dL, the total serum calcium level is underestimated by approximately 0.8 mg/dL (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hogan &#x0026; Goldfarb, 2018</a>). <a href="#ct10-2">Chart&#x00A0;10-2</a> displays a quick method that nurses can use to calculate the corrected serum calcium level.</p>
<p class="indent">Clinicians often discount a low serum calcium level in the presence of a similarly low serum albumin level. The ionized calcium level is usually normal in patients with reduced total serum calcium levels and concomitant hypoalbuminemia. When the arterial pH increases (alkalosis), more calcium becomes bound to protein. As a result, the ionized portion decreases. Symptoms of hypocalcemia may occur with alkalosis. Acidosis has the opposite effect&#x2014;that is, less calcium is bound to protein and therefore more exists in the ionized form. However, relatively small changes in serum calcium levels occur in these acid&#x2013;base abnormalities (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Stubbs, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="box1a">
<p class="BoxpNumber" id="ct10-2"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;10-2</strong></p></div>
<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Calculating Corrected Serum Calcium Level</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Abnormalities in serum albumin levels may affect interpretation of the serum calcium level. Below is a method for calculating the corrected serum calcium level if the serum albumin level is abnormal.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Quick Calculation Method</strong></p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/249-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Example Calculation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A patient&#x2019;s reported serum albumin level is 2.5 g/dL; the reported serum calcium level is 10.5 mg/dL. First, the decrease in serum albumin level from normal (i.e., the difference from the normal albumin concentration of 4 g/dL) is calculated: 4 g/dL &#x2212; 2.5 g/dL = 1.5 g/dL. Next, the following ratio is calculated:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/249-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Finally, 1.2 mg/dL is added to 10.5 mg/dL (the reported serum calcium level) to obtain the corrected total serum calcium level: 1.2 mg/dL + 10.5 mg/dL = 11.7 mg/dL.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Ideally, the ionized level of calcium should be measured in the laboratory. However, in many laboratories, only the total calcium level is reported; therefore, the concentration of the ionized fraction must be estimated by simultaneous measurement of the serum albumin level. Magnesium and phosphorus levels need to be assessed to identify possible causes of decreased calcium (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Stubbs, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s239">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Emergency Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia is life-threatening and requires prompt treatment with IV administration of a calcium salt. Parenteral calcium salts include calcium gluconate and calcium chloride (Duval, Bach, Masson, et al., 2018; Goltzman, 2019b). Although calcium chloride produces a significantly higher ionized calcium level than calcium gluconate does, it is not used as often because it is more irritating and can cause sloughing of tissue if it infiltrates.</p>
<p class="indent">IV administration of calcium is particularly dangerous in patients receiving digitalis-derived medications, because calcium ions exert an effect similar to that of digitalis and can cause digitalis toxicity, with adverse cardiac effects. The IV site that delivers calcium must be observed often for any evidence of infiltration because of the risk of extravasation and resultant cellulitis or necrosis. A 0.9% sodium chloride solution should not be used with calcium because it increases renal calcium loss. Solutions containing phosphates <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page250" title="250"></span>or bicarbonate should not be used with calcium because they cause precipitation when calcium is added. The nurse must clarify with the primary provider and pharmacist which calcium salt to administer, because calcium gluconate yields 4.5 mEq of calcium and calcium chloride provides 13.6 mEq of calcium. Calcium replacement can cause orthostatic hypotension; therefore, the patient should remain in bed during IV infusion, and blood pressure is monitored (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Duval et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Too rapid IV administration of calcium can cause cardiac arrest, preceded by bradycardia. Therefore, calcium should be diluted in D<em><sub>5</sub></em>W and given as a slow IV bolus or a slow IV infusion using an infusion pump. A 0.9% sodium chloride solution should not be used when administering calcium.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Vitamin D therapy may be instituted to increase calcium absorption from the GI tract; otherwise, the amount of calcium absorbed may not satisfy the body&#x2019;s calcium requirement. In addition, aluminum hydroxide, calcium acetate, or calcium carbonate antacids may be prescribed to decrease elevated phosphorus levels before treating hypocalcemia in the patient with chronic kidney disease. Increasing the dietary intake of calcium to at least 1000 to 1500 mg/day in the adult is recommended. Calcium supplements must be given in divided doses of no higher than 500 mg to promote calcium absorption. Calcium-containing foods include milk products; green, leafy vegetables; canned salmon; canned sardines; and fresh oysters. Hypomagnesemia can also cause tetany; if the tetany responds to IV calcium, then a low magnesium level is considered as a possible cause in chronic kidney dysfunction (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib772">Goltzman, 2019b; Rosen &#x0026; Drezner, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s240">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to assess for hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. Seizure precautions are initiated if hypocalcemia is severe. The status of the airway is closely monitored because laryngospasm can occur. Safety precautions are taken, as indicated, if confusion is present (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Duval et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must educate the patient with hypocalcemia about foods that are rich in calcium. The nurse must also advise the patient to consider calcium supplements if sufficient calcium is not consumed in the diet. Such supplements should be taken in divided doses with meals. Alcohol and caffeine in high doses inhibit calcium absorption, and moderate cigarette smoking increases urinary calcium excretion. The patient is also cautioned to avoid the overuse of laxatives and antacids that contain phosphorus, because their use decreases calcium absorption (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Rosen &#x0026; Drezner, 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s241">Calcium Excess (Hypercalcemia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hypercalcemia (serum calcium value greater than 10.4 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]) can affect many organ systems. Symptoms depend on the degree of hypercalcemia and the rate of rise of calcium in the bloodstream. Mild hypercalcemia usually causes no apparent symptoms if the rise in calcium level is chronic over a long period of time. Moderate hypercalcemia can also be well tolerated. Marked symptoms occur when rise in calcium level is acute (Shane, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s242">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common causes of hypercalcemia are malignancies and hyperparathyroidism. Malignant tumors can produce hypercalcemia by various mechanisms. The most common malignancies that are associated with hypercalcemia are breast, lung, renal, and multiple myeloma. In hyperparathyroidism, excessive PTH secretion causes increased release of calcium from the bones and increased intestinal and renal absorption of calcium. Calcifications of soft tissue occur when the calcium&#x2013;phosphorus product (serum calcium &#x00D7; serum phosphorus) exceeds 70 mg/dL. Calcium levels are inversely related to phosphorus levels (Shane, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone calcium is lost during immobilization, and sometimes this causes elevation of total (and especially ionized) calcium in the bloodstream. However, symptomatic hypercalcemia from immobilization is rare; when it does occur, it is limited to people with high calcium turnover rates (e.g., adolescents during a growth spurt). Most cases of hypercalcemia secondary to immobility occur after severe or multiple fractures or spinal cord injury (Shane, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Thiazide diuretics can cause a slight elevation in serum calcium levels because they potentiate the action of PTH on the kidneys, reducing urinary calcium excretion. Vitamin A and D intoxication, as well as chronic lithium use and theophylline toxicity, can cause calcium excess.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypercalcemia reduces neuromuscular excitability because it suppresses activity at the myoneural junction. Decreased tone in smooth and striated muscle may cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, incoordination, anorexia, and constipation. Lethal arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation) can occur when the serum calcium level is about 18 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L). Calcium enhances the inotropic effect of digitalis; therefore, hypercalcemia aggravates digitalis toxicity (Shane, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s243">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical signs and symptoms can be found in <a href="#tt10-8">Table&#x00A0;10-8</a>. The symptoms of hypercalcemia are proportional to the degree of elevation of the serum calcium level. The more severe symptoms tend to appear when the serum calcium level climbs rapidly and may be as high as 16 mg/dL (4 mmol/L) or higher. However, some patients become profoundly disturbed with serum calcium levels of only 12 mg/dL (3 mmol/L). These symptoms resolve as serum calcium levels return to normal after treatment (Shane, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Hypercalcemic crisis refers to an acute rise in the serum calcium level. Severe thirst and polyuria are often present. Other findings may include muscle weakness, intractable nausea, abdominal cramps, severe constipation, diarrhea, peptic ulcer symptoms, and bone pain. Lethargy, confusion, and coma may also occur. This condition is dangerous and may result in cardiac arrest. Emergency treatment with calcitonin is indicated (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>) (see later discussion under Pharmacologic Therapy).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s244">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In hypercalcemia, the serum calcium level is greater than 10.4 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). Cardiovascular changes may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page251" title="251"></span>include a variety of arrhythmias (e.g., heart blocks) and shortening of the QT interval and ST segment. The PR interval is sometimes prolonged. The double-antibody PTH test may be used to differentiate between primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy as a cause of hypercalcemia: PTH levels are increased in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism and suppressed in malignancy. X-rays may reveal bone changes if the patient has hypercalcemia secondary to a malignancy, bone cavitations, or urinary calculi. Urine calcium can be normal or elevated in hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia caused by malignancy (Shane, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s245">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Therapeutic aims include decreasing the serum calcium level and reversing the process causing the hypercalcemia. Treating the underlying cause (e.g., chemotherapy for a malignancy, partial parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism) is essential.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To treat hypercalcemia, measures include administering fluids to dilute serum calcium and promote its excretion by the kidneys, mobilizing the patient, and restricting dietary calcium intake. IV administration of 0.9% sodium chloride solution temporarily dilutes the serum calcium level and increases urinary calcium excretion by inhibiting tubular reabsorption of calcium. Administering IV phosphate can cause a reciprocal drop in serum calcium. Furosemide is often used in conjunction with administration of a saline solution; in addition to causing diuresis, furosemide increases calcium excretion. Although often overlooked, fluids and medications that contain calcium and dietary sources of calcium should be halted (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Calcitonin can be used to lower the serum calcium level and is particularly useful for patients with heart disease or acute kidney injury who cannot tolerate large sodium loads. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption, increases the deposition of calcium and phosphorus in the bones, and increases urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus. Although several forms are available, calcitonin derived from salmon is commonly used. Skin testing for allergy to salmon calcitonin may be necessary before the hormone is given. Systemic allergic reactions are possible because this hormone is a protein; resistance to the medication may develop later because of antibody formation. Calcitonin is administered by intramuscular injection or intranasal spray rather than subcutaneously, because patients with hypercalcemia have poor perfusion of subcutaneous tissue (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with cancer, treatment is directed at controlling the condition by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Corticosteroids may be used to decrease bone turnover and tubular reabsorption for patients with sarcoidosis, myelomas, lymphomas, and leukemias; patients with solid tumors are less responsive. Some bisphosphonates (e.g., pamidronate disodium, ibandronate sodium) inhibit osteoclast activity. IV forms of bisphosphonates can cause fever, transient leukopenia, eye inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, and jaw osteonecrosis (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Mithramycin, a cytotoxic antibiotic, inhibits bone resorption and thus lowers the serum calcium level. This agent must be used cautiously because it has significant side effects, including thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity, rebound hypercalcemia when discontinued, and hepatotoxicity. Inorganic phosphate salts can be given orally or by nasogastric tube (in the form of Phospho-Soda or Neutra-Phos), rectally (as retention enemas), or IV. IV phosphate therapy is used with extreme caution in the treatment of hypercalcemia, because it can cause severe calcification in various tissues, hypotension, tetany, and acute kidney injury (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2018</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s246">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse must monitor for hypercalcemia in at-risk patients. Interventions such as increasing patient mobility and encouraging fluids can help prevent hypercalcemia, or at least minimize its severity. Hospitalized patients at risk should be encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible. Those who are outpatients and receive home care are educated about the importance of frequent ambulation (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Daly, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When encouraging oral fluids, the nurse considers the patient&#x2019;s likes and dislikes. Fluids containing sodium should be given unless contraindicated, because sodium assists with calcium excretion. Patients are encouraged to drink 2.8 to 3.8 L (3 to 4 quarts) of fluid daily (Sterns, 2017b). Adequate fiber in the diet is encouraged to offset the tendency for constipation. Safety precautions are implemented, as necessary, when altered mental status is present. The patient and family are informed that these mental changes are reversible with treatment. Increased calcium increases the effects of digitalis; therefore, the patient on digitalis should be frequently assessed for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Because ECG changes (premature ventricular contractions, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and heart block) can occur, the cardiac rate and rhythm are monitored for any abnormalities (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
