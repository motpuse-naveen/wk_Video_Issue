<p class="nonindent">People who are <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;LGBTQ:&lt;/b&gt; acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer">LGBTQ</button></strong> (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) have unique health care needs. They also experience particular health risks and disparities based on sexuality and gender identity. Increasingly, nursing and medical professionals are recognizing these risks and disparities; furthermore, these professionals are acknowledging the importance of providing culturally appropriate care to people who identify as LGBTQ. Nurses will encounter people who are LGBTQ and their families in every practice setting. As they would for other diverse populations, nurses should be prepared to provide quality and culturally appropriate care. This chapter focuses on the terminology around sexuality and gender identity, culturally appropriate assessment and communication, and assessment and management of patients who identify as LGBTQ, and, in particular, the unique health care needs of those patients seeking gender reassignment. The management of patients seeking gender reassignment using both nonsurgical and surgical treatments is discussed.</p>
