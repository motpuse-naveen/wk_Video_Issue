<h4 class="h4" id="s963">Arteriosclerosis and Atherosclerosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Arteriosclerosis</strong> (hardening of the arteries) is the most common disease of the arteries. It is a diffuse process whereby the muscle fibers and the endothelial lining of the walls of small arteries and arterioles become thickened. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;atherosclerosis:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal accumulation of lipid deposits and fibrous tissue within arterial walls and the lumen">Atherosclerosis</button></strong> involves a different process, affecting the intima of large and medium-sized arteries. These changes consist of the accumulation of lipids, calcium, blood components, carbohydrates, and fibrous tissue on the intimal layer of the artery. These accumulations are referred to as atheromas or plaques.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the pathologic processes of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis differ, rarely does one occur without the other, and the terms are often used interchangeably. Atherosclerosis is a generalized disease of the arteries, and when it is present in the extremities, it is usually present elsewhere in the body.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s964">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common direct results of atherosclerosis in arteries include stenosis (narrowing) of the lumen, obstruction by thrombosis, aneurysm, ulceration, and rupture. Its indirect results are malnutrition and the subsequent fibrosis of the organs that the sclerotic arteries supply with blood. All actively functioning tissue cells require an abundant supply of nutrients and oxygen and are sensitive to any reduction in the supply of these nutrients. If such reductions are severe and permanent, the cells undergo ischemic necrosis (death of cells due to deficient blood flow) and are replaced by fibrous tissues, which require much less blood flow.</p>
<p class="indent">Atherosclerosis can develop in any part of the vascular system, but certain sites are more vulnerable, such as regions where arteries bifurcate or branch into smaller vessels, with males having more below-the-knee pathology than females (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1940">Jelani, Petrov, Martinez, et al., 2018</a>). In the proximal lower extremity, these include the distal abdominal aorta, the common iliac arteries, the orifice of the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries, and the superficial femoral artery in the adductor canal, which is particularly narrow. Distal to the knee, atherosclerosis can occur anywhere along the course of the artery.</p>
<p class="indent">Although many theories exist about the development of atherosclerosis, no single theory explains the pathogenesis completely; however, tenets of several theories are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page827" title="827"></span>incorporated into the reaction-to-injury theory. According to this theory, vascular endothelial cell injury results from prolonged hemodynamic forces, such as shearing stresses and turbulent flow, irradiation, chemical exposure, or chronic hyperlipidemia. Injury to the endothelium increases the aggregation of platelets and monocytes at the site of the injury. Smooth muscle cells migrate and proliferate, allowing a matrix of collagen and elastic fibers to form (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Atherosclerotic lesions are of two types: fatty streaks and fibrous plaque.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Fatty streaks are yellow and smooth, protrude slightly into the lumen of the artery, and are composed of lipids and elongated smooth muscle cells. These lesions have been found in the arteries of people of all ages, including infants. It is not clear whether fatty streaks predispose a person to the formation of fibrous plaques or whether they are reversible. They do not usually cause clinical symptoms.</span></li>
<li><span>Fibrous plaques are composed of smooth muscle cells, collagen fibers, plasma components, and lipids. They are white to white-yellow and protrude to various degrees into the arterial lumen, sometimes completely obstructing it. These plaques are found predominantly in the abdominal aorta and the coronary, popliteal, and internal carotid arteries, and they are believed to be progressive lesions (see <a href="#ff26-6">Fig. 26-6</a>).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Gradual narrowing of the arterial lumen stimulates the development of collateral circulation (see <a href="#ff26-7">Fig. 26-7</a>). Collateral circulation arises from preexisting vessels that enlarge to reroute blood flow around a hemodynamically significant stenosis or occlusion. Collateral flow allows continued perfusion to the tissues, but it is often inadequate to meet increased metabolic demands, and ischemia results.</p>

Fatty streaks are an early manifestation of atherosclerosis. Fatty streaks either regress or progress to fibrous plaques and eventually to atheroma. Atheromatous plaque may be complicated by hemorrhage, ulceration, calcification, or thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, claudication, rest pain, or gangrene.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s965">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many risk factors are associated with atherosclerosis (see <a href="#ct26-3">Chart 26-3</a>). Although it is not entirely clear whether modification of these risk factors prevents the development of cardiovascular disease, evidence indicates that it may slow the process.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of nicotine products may be one of the most important risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Nicotine in tobacco decreases blood flow to the extremities and increases heart rate and blood pressure by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, causing vasoconstriction (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1958">Quintella Farah, Silva Rigoni, de Almeida Correia, et al., 2019</a>). It also increases the risk of clot formation by increasing the aggregation of platelets. Carbon monoxide, a toxin produced <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page828" title="828"></span>by burning tobacco, combines more readily with hemoglobin than oxygen, depriving the tissues of oxygen. There is evidence that smoking decreases high-density lipoprotein (HDL; good cholesterol) levels and alters the ratios between HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL; bad cholesterol), HDL and triglycerides, and HDL and total cholesterol levels (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for discussion of HDL and LDL and their association with atherosclerosis). The amount of tobacco used&#x2014;inhaled in traditional or e-cigarette form, or chewed&#x2014;is directly related to the extent of the disease, and cessation of any type of nicotine product use reduces the risk (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Jelani et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Diabetes increases the overall risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) two- to fourfold, with amputation rates 5 to 10 times higher than in patients without diabetes. Patients with diabetes show an earlier onset and more rapid progression of PAD than patients without diabetes; furthermore, they also exhibit a different anatomic distribution of pathology, with a greater severity of disease in the profunda femoris and in all segments below the knee (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>). How diabetes affects the onset and progression of atherosclerosis is multifactorial and includes incitation of inflammatory processes, derangement of various cell types within vessel walls, promotion of coagulation, and inhibition of fibrinolysis (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Hazarika &#x0026; Annex, 2017</a>). Many other factors, such as obesity, stress, and lack of exercise, have been identified as contributing to the disease process.</p>
<p class="indent">C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive marker of cardiovascular inflammation, both systemically and locally. Slight increases in serum CRP levels are associated with an increased risk of damage in the vasculature, especially if these increases are accompanied by other risk factors, including increasing age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, elevated blood glucose levels, use of nicotine products, or a positive family history of cardiovascular disease (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Hazarika &#x0026; Annex, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In some studies, hyperhomocysteinemia has been positively correlated with the risk of peripheral, cerebrovascular, and coronary artery disease as well as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Homocysteine is a protein that promotes coagulation by increasing factor V and factor XI activity while depressing protein C activation and increasing the binding of lipoprotein(a) in fibrin. These processes increase thrombin formation and the propensity for thrombosis. Folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> have been reported to reduce serum homocysteine levels but there are no data demonstrating this therapy reduces adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, the use of B complex vitamins to reduce cardiovascular disease in patients with PAD is not recommended (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s966">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Intermittent claudication is a symptom of generalized atherosclerosis and may be a marker of atherosclerosis in other arterial territories, such as the coronary and carotid arteries. The suspicion that a high-fat diet contributes to atherosclerosis means that it is reasonable to measure serum cholesterol and to begin disease prevention efforts that include diet modification. The American Heart Association recommends reducing the amount of fat ingested, substituting unsaturated fats for saturated fats, and decreasing cholesterol intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain medications that supplement dietary modification and exercise are used to reduce blood lipid levels. Current evidence-based guidelines established by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) as first-line therapy in patients with PAD for secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1923">Conte, Bradbury, Kolh, et al., 2019</a>). These statins may include medications such as atorvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin. Several other classes of medications used to reduce lipid levels include bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol), nicotinic acid (niacin), fibric acid inhibitors (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), and cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe). Patients receiving long-term therapy with these medications require close monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypertension, which may accelerate the rate at which atherosclerotic lesions form in high-pressure vessels, can lead to a stroke, ischemic renal disease, severe PAD, or coronary artery disease. Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of PAD and may be a more significant risk factor for women than men based on research findings from the classic Framingham Heart Study and a similar study performed in Europe (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Jelani et al., 2018</a>). The majority of patients with hypertension require more than two antihypertensive agents to reach target blood pressure, and at least one third require more than three antihypertensive agents to achieve effective blood pressure control (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). See <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> for further discussion of hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Although no single risk factor has been identified as the primary contributor to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it is clear that the greater the number of risk factors, the greater the risk of atherosclerosis. Elimination of all controllable risk factors, particularly nicotine use, is strongly recommended.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page829" title="829"></span></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s967">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical signs and symptoms resulting from atherosclerosis depend on the organ or tissue affected. Coronary atherosclerosis (heart disease), angina, and acute myocardial infarction are discussed in <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>. Cerebrovascular diseases, including transient ischemic attacks and stroke, are discussed in <a href="c62.xhtml">Chapter 62</a>. Atherosclerosis of the aorta, including aneurysm, and atherosclerotic lesions of the extremities are discussed later in this chapter. Renovascular disease (renal artery stenosis and end-stage kidney disease) is discussed in Chapter&#x00A0;48.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s968">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of atherosclerosis involves modification of risk factors, a controlled exercise program to improve circulation and functional capacity, medication therapy, and interventional or surgical procedures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Vascular surgical procedures are divided into two groups: inflow procedures, which improve blood supply from the aorta into the femoral artery, and outflow procedures, which provide blood supply to vessels below the femoral artery. Inflow surgical procedures are described with diseases of the aorta and outflow procedures with peripheral artery disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endovascular Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Endovascular</strong> therapies include various procedures that use a puncture or small incision to place catheters inside a blood vessel to repair it or insert a device and have replaced a large proportion of open surgical approaches to management. If an isolated lesion or lesions are identified on imaging, <strong>angioplasty</strong>, also called <em>percutaneous transluminal angioplasty</em> (PTA), or an atherectomy, may be performed. After the patient receives a local anesthetic agent, a balloon-tipped catheter is maneuvered across the area of stenosis. Although some clinicians theorize that PTA improves blood flow by overstretching (and thereby dilating) the elastic fibers of the nondiseased arterial segment, most believe that the procedure widens the arterial lumen by &#x201C;cracking&#x201D; and flattening the plaque against the vessel wall (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). An <strong>atherectomy</strong> reduces the plaque buildup within an artery using a cutting device or laser. Complications from PTA and atherectomy include hematoma formation, <strong>embolus</strong> (blood clot, fatty deposit, or air that travels through the blood, lodges in an artery or vein, and blocks flow), <strong>dissection</strong> (separation of the intima) of the vessel, acute arterial occlusion, and bleeding. To decrease the risk of restenosis, stents (small mesh tubes made of nitinol, titanium, or stainless steel) may be inserted to support the walls of the artery and prevent collapse immediately after balloon deflation (see <a href="#ff26-8">Fig. 26-8</a>). A variety of stents and stent grafts may be used for short-segment stenoses. Complications associated with stent or stent graft use include distal embolization, dissection, and dislodgment. The advantage of angioplasty, atherectomy, stents, and stent grafts is a decreased length of hospital stay; many of the procedures are performed on an outpatient basis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s969">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An overview of the care of a patient with peripheral artery problems is provided in <a href="#ct26-4">Chart 26-4</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Improving Peripheral Arterial Circulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial blood supply to a body part can be enhanced by positioning the body part below the level of the heart. For the lower extremities, this is accomplished by elevating the head of the patient&#x2019;s bed or by having the patient use a reclining chair or sit with the feet resting on the floor.</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">For patients with PAD, blood flow to the lower extremities needs to be enhanced; therefore, the nurse encourages keeping the lower extremities in a neutral or dependent position. In contrast, for patients with venous insufficiency, blood return to the heart needs to be enhanced, so the lower extremities are elevated. Exercise promotes the development of collateral circulation (arterial) and activates the musculovenous pump (venous).</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The nurse can assist the patient with walking or other moderate or graded isometric exercises that promote blood <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page830" title="830"></span>flow and encourage the development of collateral circulation. The amount of exercise a patient can tolerate before the onset of pain is determined to provide a baseline for evaluation. The nurse instructs the patient to walk to the point of pain, rest until the pain subsides, and then resume walking so that endurance can be increased as collateral circulation develops. Pain can serve as a guide in determining the appropriate amount of exercise. The onset of pain indicates that the tissues are not receiving adequate oxygen, signaling the patient to rest. A supervised exercise therapy (SET) program should be prescribed for patients with claudication. SET can result in increased walking distance before the onset of claudication (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Gerhard-Herman et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Before recommending any exercise program or SET, the patient&#x2019;s primary provider should be consulted. Conditions that worsen with exercise include leg ulcers, cellulitis, gangrene, or acute thrombotic occlusions.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Vasodilation and Preventing Vascular Compression</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial dilation increases blood flow to the extremities and is therefore a goal for patients with PAD. However, if the arteries are severely sclerosed, inelastic, or damaged, dilation is not possible. For this reason, measures to promote vasodilation, such as medications, endovascular interventions or surgery, may be only minimally effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing interventions may involve applications of warmth to promote arterial flow and instructions to the patient to avoid exposure to cold temperatures, which causes vasoconstriction. Adequate clothing and warm temperatures protect the patient from chilling.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page832" title="832"></span></p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients are instructed to test the temperature of bath water and to avoid using hot-water bottles and heating pads on the extremities. It is safer to apply a hot-water bottle or a heating pad to the abdomen; this can cause reflex vasodilation in the extremities.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">In patients with vasospastic disorders (e.g., Raynaud&#x2019;s disease), heat may be applied directly to ischemic extremities using a warmed or electric blanket; however, the temperature of the heat source must not exceed body temperature. Even at low temperatures, trauma to the tissues can occur in ischemic extremities.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Excess heat may increase the metabolic rate of the extremities and the need for oxygen beyond that provided by the reduced arterial flow through the diseased artery. Heat must be used with great caution!</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Nicotine from any tobacco product causes vasospasm and can thereby dramatically reduce circulation to the extremities. Tobacco smoke also impairs transport and cellular use of oxygen and increases blood viscosity. Patients with arterial insufficiency who smoke, chew tobacco, or use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars, must be fully informed of the effects of nicotine on circulation and encouraged to stop.</p>
<p class="indent">Emotional stress can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and cause peripheral vasoconstriction. Emotional stress can be minimized to some degree by avoiding stressful situations when possible or by consistently following a stress management program. Counseling services or use of alternative or complementary therapies (e.g., relaxation, yoga, aromatherapy, mindfulness) may be indicated for patients who cannot cope effectively with situational stressors.</p>
<p class="indent">Constrictive clothing and accessories such as tight socks or shoelaces may impede arterial circulation to the extremities and promote venous stasis and therefore should be avoided. Crossing the legs for more than 15 minutes at a time should be discouraged because it compresses vessels in the legs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Frequently, the pain associated with peripheral arterial insufficiency is chronic, continuous, and disabling. It limits activities, affects work and life responsibilities, disturbs sleep, and alters the patient&#x2019;s sense of well-being. Patients may be depressed, irritable, and unable to exert the energy necessary to execute prescribed therapies, making pain relief even more difficult. Analgesic agents such as hydrocodone plus acetaminophen, oxycodone, oxycodone plus acetylsalicylic acid, or oxycodone plus acetaminophen may be helpful in reducing pain so that the patient can participate in therapies that can increase circulation and ultimately relieve pain more effectively. Particularly in older patients, these medications can be dangerous, contributing to delirium and falls. In all patients, issues of dependence need to be considered.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Tissue Integrity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Poorly perfused tissues are susceptible to damage and infection. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and diabetes are at increased risk. When lesions develop, healing may be delayed or inhibited because of the poor blood supply to the area. Infected, nonhealing ulcerations of the extremities can be debilitating and may require prolonged and often expensive treatments. Amputation of an ischemic toe, forefoot or limb may eventually be necessary. Measures to prevent these complications must be a high priority and vigorously implemented. Centers of excellence for the prevention of amputation which involve a multidisciplinary, specialty team approach to management have become increasingly important for early intervention and surveillance.</p>
<p class="indent">Trauma to the extremities must be avoided. Advising the patient to wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes or slippers to prevent injury to the skin may be helpful, and recommending neutral soaps and body lotions may prevent drying and cracking of skin. However, the nurse should instruct the patient not to apply lotion between the toes, because the increased moisture can lead to maceration of the interdigital skin. Scratching and vigorous rubbing can abrade skin and create sites for microbial invasion; therefore, feet should be patted dry. Stockings should be clean and dry. Fingernails and toenails should be carefully trimmed straight across and sharp corners filed to follow the contour of the nail. If the nails cannot be trimmed safely, it is necessary to consult a podiatrist, who can also remove corns and calluses. Special shoe inserts may be needed to prevent calluses from recurring. Blisters, ingrown toenails, infection, or other problems should be reported to health care professionals for treatment and follow-up. Patients with diminished vision and those with disability that limits mobility of the arms or legs may require assistance in periodically examining the lower extremities for trauma or evidence of inflammation or infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Good nutrition promotes healing and prevents tissue breakdown and is therefore included in the plan for patients with peripheral vascular disease. Eating a diet that contains adequate protein and vitamins is necessary for patients with arterial insufficiency. Key nutrients, such as vitamin C and zinc, play specific roles in wound healing. However, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found no evidence to support that supplementation with vitamins and antioxidants prevents vascular diseases (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1967">Sultan, Murarka, Jahangir, et al., 2017</a>). Obesity strains the heart, increases venous congestion, and reduces circulation; therefore, a weight reduction plan may be necessary for patients who are overweight or have obesity. A diet low in fats and lipids is indicated for patients with atherosclerosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In older adults, the symptoms of PAD may be more pronounced than in younger people. In older patients who are inactive, limb ischemia or gangrene may be the first sign of disease (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1963">Schorr, Treat-Jacobson, Lindquist, et al., 2017</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct26-5">Chart 26-5</a>. These patients may have adjusted their lifestyle to accommodate the limitations imposed by the disease and may not walk far enough to develop symptoms of claudication due to other comorbid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page833" title="833"></span>conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure. Circulation is decreased, although this is not apparent to the patient until trauma occurs. At this point, gangrene develops when minimal arterial flow is impaired further by edema formation resulting from the traumatic event.</p>
<p class="indent">Intermittent claudication may occur after walking only one half to one block or after walking up a slight incline. Any prolonged pressure on the foot can cause pressure injuries that may become ulcerated, infected, or gangrenous. The outcomes of arterial insufficiency can include reduced mobility and activity as well as a loss of independence. Older adults with reduced mobility are less likely to remain in the community setting, have higher rates of hospitalizations, and experience a poorer quality of life. Those with cognitive impairment may also be unable to verbalize symptoms such as pain.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Understanding the Relationship Between Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Symptoms and Ischemia</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Schorr, E. N., Treat-Jacobson, D., Lindquist, R. (2017). The relationship between peripheral artery disease symptomatology and ischemia. <em>Nursing Research</em>, <em>66</em>(5), 378&#x2013;387.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Peripheral artery disease (PAD) impacts over eight million Americans and is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. It is typically identified when patients report claudication (i.e., aching, cramping pain, fatigue in calves with activity). However, less than 33% of individuals who have a diagnosis of PAD report classic claudication, potentially resulting in underdiagnosis of PAD. A better understanding of symptom presentation and changes in tissue oxygenation may enhance earlier detection and treatment of PAD. The aim of this study was to explore the range of symptoms (typical versus atypical, location, and description) that patients with PAD experience to better understand the relationship between symptom variation and calf muscle ischemia.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This descriptive study explored symptoms during exercise testing and recovery in patients with a diagnosis of PAD. Individuals who were English speaking, 21 years of age or older, and met specific diagnostic criteria were recruited from a larger study. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension, angina or dyspnea on exercise testing, or vascular procedures performed within the last 3 months were excluded. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was used as a measure of disease severity. Participants exercised on a treadmill with a near-infrared spectroscopy device to measure calf muscle tissue saturation index (TSI). In addition, participants rated symptom intensity using a numerical rating scale (NRS) and provided self-report of symptom location and descriptors. Data were collected at three points (e.g., rest, exercise, recovery) during three successive treadmill tests. Descriptive statistics were generated and symptom variables and relevant demographic and clinical data (e.g., age, gender, race, ABI, diabetes, neuropathy) were examined with the TSI measurements during exercise and recovery using multilevel modeling procedures.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Three successive episodes of treadmill testing with 40 participants resulted in 120 exercise tests. The majority of participants were Caucasian males (80%) with an average age of 68 years (SD 0.92). More than half (69.2%) of tests were stopped due to discomfort in the calf, with only 55% of participants reporting typical descriptors of claudication. TSI declined rapidly between the start of exercise and symptom onset. The lowest TSI was often reached before reported maximum discomfort. Changes in TSI were related to exercise time (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001), baseline TSI (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001), exercise rating (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001), and ABI (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.5). In the recovery phase, TSI steadily increased as pain reduced; TSI was associated with recovery rating (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001) and ABI (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.03).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Recognizing variations in symptom presentation (e.g., intensity, location, description) and associated ischemic changes in PAD is important in understanding individual patient experiences and tailoring education and treatment. Nurses should be aware that some patients with PAD may use terms such as <em>burn, pressure,</em> or <em>tight</em> to describe related discomfort and that patients may report discomfort in atypical locations, such as the foot. A better understanding of the full range of ischemic symptoms in PAD may prompt earlier diagnosis and facilitate risk factor modification and exercise therapy. Unlike other medical conditions, where the onset of pain indicates the potential of increasing tissue damage with ongoing activity, pain in PAD can be used as an indicator to adjust the exercise program to extend the person&#x2019;s walking distance. Exercise prescription can greatly reduce the progression of atherosclerosis, limiting not only distal disease but also coronary and cerebral disease. Although additional research is needed, nurses can consider these findings when planning care for patients with PAD to ensure they are providing appropriate education and encouraging safe exercise regimens.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The self-care program is planned with the patient so that activities that promote arterial and venous circulation, relieve pain, and promote tissue integrity are acceptable. The patient and family are helped to understand the reasons for each aspect of the plan, the possible consequences of nonadherence, and the importance of keeping follow-up appointments. Long-term care of the feet and legs is of prime importance in the prevention of trauma, ulceration, and gangrene. <a href="c26-sec06.xhtml#ct26-6">Chart 26-6</a> provides detailed patient instructions for foot and leg care.</p>
