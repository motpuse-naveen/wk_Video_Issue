<h4 class="h4a" id="s2264"><strong>ASSESSMENT OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</strong></h4>
<h4 class="h4" id="s2265">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The female reproductive system is complex because it involves many external and internal structures that are under hormonal control.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2266">Anatomy of the Female Reproductive System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The female reproductive system consists of external and internal pelvic structures. Other anatomic structures that affect the female reproductive system include the hypothalamus and pituitary gland of the endocrine system. The female breast is covered in <a href="c52.xhtml">Chapter 52</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">External Genitalia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The female external genitalia are composed of a variety of tissue types starting with the mons pubis, which is a thick pad of adipose tissue that covers the symphysis pubis and cushions it during penile-vaginal intercourse (see <a href="#ff50-1">Fig.&#x00A0;50-1</a>). Moving downward are two thick folds of connective tissue covered with pubic hair known as the labia majora, which extend from the mons pubis to the perineum. The labia majora cover the oval-shaped area known as the vestibule, where the labia minora originate. The labia minora are two narrow folds of hairless skin, beginning at the clitoris and extending to the fourchette. This area is highly vascular and rich in nerve supply and glands that lubricate the vulva, the collective name for the external genitalia. The labia minora join at the top to form the prepuce, a hoodlike structure that partially covers the clitoris. The clitoris, an erectile organ located beneath the pubic arch, consists of a shaft and glans. It secretes smegma, a pheromone (olfactory erotic stimulant), and is sensitive to touch and temperature. Below the clitoris is the urinary meatus, the external opening of the female urethra that has a slit appearance. Below the meatus is the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;introitus:&lt;/b&gt; perineal opening to the vagina">introitus</button></strong> (vaginal opening). On each side of the introitus are Bartholin glands, which secrete mucus through tiny ducts that lie within the labia minora and are external to the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hymen:&lt;/b&gt; tissue that covers the vaginal opening partially or completely before vaginal penetration">hymen</button></strong> (membrane that encircles the introitus). The vestibule is bounded by the clitoris, fourchette, and labia minora and contains the urethral meatus. Skene glands, located within the urethral meatus, produce mucus for lubrication (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3616">Ball, Dains, Flynn, et al., 2019</a>). The Bartholin glands on either side of the entrance to the vagina also produce mucus for lubrication (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The hymen opening varies widely among women, and the size of the opening is an unreliable indicator of sexual experience (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). The fourchette is located in the midline below the vaginal opening where the labia majora and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1642" title="1642"></span>labia minora merge. The perineum is the area between the vagina and the rectum or anus; it is a skin-covered muscular tissue (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff50-1">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff50-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff50-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;50-1 &#x2022;</span> External female genitalia.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">A number of muscles support the external genitalia. Support for the pelvic organs is from the deep muscle layer known as the levator ani. This muscle, which forms most of the pelvic diaphragm, is composed of the iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, and the puborectalis muscles. It supports the organs of reproduction and provides elasticity of the pelvic floor. When viewed from above, it looks like joined cupped hands. Its main function is to provide support to the organs of the pelvis when increased pressure from coughing and sneezing occurs. When this muscle group is contracted, the pelvic floor is lifted upward, supporting continence (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eickmeyer, 2017</a>). Muscles that contribute to the strength of the pelvic floor may be damaged during childbirth (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eickmeyer, 2017</a>). The bulbocavernosus, ischiocavernosus, and transverse perineal muscles encircle and support the vagina and urethra as well as the anal sphincter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Internal Reproductive Structures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The internal structures consist of the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian or uterine tubes (see <a href="#ff50-2">Fig.&#x00A0;50-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Vagina</p>
<p class="nonindent">The vagina, a tubular-shaped canal lined with glandular mucous membrane, is 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) long and extends upward and backward from the vulva to the cervix. It is thin walled and can be distended during birth. It is highly vascular and has little sensation. Anterior to it are the bladder and the urethra, and posterior to it lies the rectum. The anterior and posterior walls of the vagina normally touch each other. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fornix:&lt;/b&gt; upper part of the vagina">fornix</button></strong> (the upper part of the vagina) surrounds the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cervix:&lt;/b&gt; bottom (inferior) part of the uterus that is located in the vagina">cervix</button></strong> (the inferior part of the uterus) (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Uterus</p>
<p class="nonindent">The uterus, a pear-shaped, muscular organ, is about 7.5 cm (3 inches) long and 5 cm (2 inches) wide at its upper part. Its walls are about 1.25 cm (0.5 inch) thick. The size of the uterus varies, depending on parity (number of pregnancies), size of the infants, and uterine abnormalities (e.g., fibroids, which are a type of tumor that may distort the uterus). A woman who is nulliparous (one who has not completed a pregnancy to the stage of fetal viability) usually has a smaller uterus than a woman who is multiparous (one who has completed two or more pregnancies to the stage of fetal viability). The uterus lies posterior to the bladder and is held in position by several ligaments. The round ligaments extend anteriorly and laterally to the internal inguinal ring and down the inguinal canal, where they blend with the tissues of the labia majora. The broad ligaments are folds of peritoneum extending from the lateral pelvic walls and enveloping the fallopian tubes. The uterosacral ligaments extend posterior to the sacrum (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eickmeyer, 2017</a>).</p>

<img src="images/ff50-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff50-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;50-2 &#x2022;</span> Internal female reproductive structures.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The uterus has four parts: the cervix, fundus, corpus, and isthmus. The cervix is the opening to the uterus and projects into the vagina. A larger upper part, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fundus:&lt;/b&gt; the rounded upper portion of the uterus">fundus</button></strong>, is the rounded portion above the insertion of the fallopian tubes. The corpus or body is the main portion of the uterus located between the fundus and the isthmus. The isthmus is referred to as the lower uterine segment during pregnancy and joins the corpus to the cervix.</p>
<p class="indent">The cervix is divided into two portions. The portion above the site of attachment of the cervix to the vaginal vault is known as the supravaginal portion; the portion below the attachment site that protrudes into the vagina is known as the vaginal portion. The cervix is composed of fibrous connective tissue. The diameter varies from 2 to 5 cm depending on the childbearing history. The length is usually 2.5 to 3 cm in the woman who is not pregnant. The vaginal portion is smooth, firm, and doughnut shaped with a visible central opening referred to as the external os. The external os is round before the first birth and is often slitlike in shape after childbirth. The internal os is the opening in the cervix to the uterine cavity. In response to cyclic hormones, the cervix produces mucus, which is an important factor in fertility awareness. The vaginal surface of the cervix is covered with squamous epithelium, a rapid cellular growth site of cervical cancer and precancerous changes.</p>
<p class="indent">The uterine wall has three layers. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endometrium:&lt;/b&gt; mucous membrane lining of the uterus">endometrium</button></strong>, the innermost layer, is highly vascular and responds to hormone stimulation to prepare to receive the developing ovum. It sloughs if pregnancy does not occur, resulting in menstruation; if pregnancy occurs, it sloughs after delivery. The myometrium, the middle layer, is made up of several smooth muscle layers. The outer layer of the myometrium is composed of longitudinal fibers, chiefly in the fundus, which provide the power to expel the fetus. The middle layer of the myometrium is composed of fibers interlaced with blood vessels in a figure-eight pattern called a <em>living ligature</em> because it contracts after childbirth to help control blood loss (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eickmeyer, 2017</a>). The inner layer of the myometrium is composed of circular fibers that are concentrated around the internal cervical os to help keep the cervix closed during pregnancy. The outer layer of the uterus is composed of parietal peritoneum, which covers most of the uterus. From here, the oviducts or fallopian (or uterine) tubes extend outward, and their lumina are internally continuous with the uterine cavity (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). The fallopian tubes or oviducts are the passageway for eggs from the ovary to the uterus. They curve around each ovary and are attached to the uterine fundus. Fallopian tubes are about 10 cm in length and are comprised of four parts. The infundibulum, the most distal portion, is covered in fimbriae, whose wavelike motion helps to pull the egg into the tube. The ampulla is usually the site of fertilization of the egg or ovum. The fallopian tube then narrows from its 0.6 cm diameter in the isthmus, ending in the narrowest part of the interstitial portion, which opens into the uterine cavity. The fallopian tube also secretes nutrients for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1643" title="1643"></span>growth and development of the ovum after fertilization while it passes down the tube to the uterus.</p>
<p class="h7">Ovaries</p>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ovaries:&lt;/b&gt; almond-shaped reproductive organs that produce eggs at ovulation and play a major role in hormone production">ovaries</button></strong> lie behind the broad ligaments and behind and below the fallopian tubes. They are almond-shaped bodies about 3 cm (1.2 inches) long. At birth, they contain thousands of tiny egg cells, or ova. The ovaries and the fallopian tubes together are referred to as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adnexa:&lt;/b&gt; the fallopian tubes and ovaries">adnexa</button></strong>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2267">Function of the Female Reproductive System</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Ovulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">At puberty (usually between 11 and 13 years of age), the ova begin to mature and menstrual cycles begin. In the follicular phase, an ovum enlarges into a cystic structure called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;graafian follicle:&lt;/b&gt; cystic structure that develops on the ovary as ovulation begins">graafian follicle</button></strong> until it reaches the surface of the ovary, where transport occurs. The ovum (or oocyte) is discharged into the peritoneal cavity. This periodic discharge of matured ovum is referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ovulation:&lt;/b&gt; discharge of a mature ovum from the ovary">ovulation</button></strong>. The ovum usually finds its way into the fallopian tube, where it is carried to the uterus. If it is penetrated by a spermatozoon, the male reproductive cell, a union occurs, and conception takes place. After the discharge of the ovum, the cells of the graafian follicle undergo a rapid change. Gradually, they become yellow and produce <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;progesterone:&lt;/b&gt; hormone produced by the corpus luteum that prepares the uterus for receiving the fertilized ovum">progesterone</button></strong>, a hormone that prepares the uterus for receiving the fertilized ovum. Ovulation usually occurs 2 weeks prior to the next menstrual period (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3617">Casanova, Chuang, Goepfert, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Menstrual Cycle</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The menstrual cycle is a complex process involving the reproductive and endocrine systems. The ovaries produce steroid hormones, predominantly estrogens and progesterone. Several different estrogens are produced by the ovarian follicle, which consists of the developing ovum and its surrounding cells. The most potent of the ovarian estrogens is estradiol. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;estrogens:&lt;/b&gt; several hormones produced in the ovaries that develop and maintain the female reproductive system">Estrogens</button></strong> are responsible for developing and maintaining the female reproductive organs and the secondary sex characteristics associated with the adult female. Estrogens play an important role in breast development and in monthly cyclic changes in the uterus (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Progesterone is also important in regulating the changes that occur in the uterus during the menstrual cycle. It is secreted by the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;corpus luteum:&lt;/b&gt; site within a follicle that changes after ovulation">corpus luteum</button></strong> (site within a follicle that changes after ovulation) or the ovarian follicle after the ovum has been released. Progesterone is the most important hormone for conditioning the endometrium (the mucous membrane lining of the uterus) in preparation for implantation of a fertilized ovum. If pregnancy occurs, the progesterone secretion becomes largely a function of the placenta and is essential for maintaining a normal pregnancy. In addition, progesterone, working with estrogen, prepares the breast for producing and secreting milk. Androgens are hormones produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands in small amounts. These hormones affect many aspects of female health, including follicle development, libido, oiliness of hair and skin, and hair growth (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Two gonadotropic hormones are released by the pituitary gland: <strong>follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</strong> and <strong>luteinizing hormone (LH)</strong>. FSH is primarily responsible for stimulating the ovaries to secrete estrogen. LH is primarily responsible for stimulating progesterone production. Feedback mechanisms, in part, regulate FSH and LH secretion. For example, elevated estrogen levels in the blood inhibit FSH secretion but promote LH secretion, whereas elevated progesterone levels inhibit LH secretion. In addition, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus affects the rate of FSH and LH release (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The secretion of ovarian hormones follows a cyclic pattern that results in changes in the uterine endometrium and in menstruation (see <a href="#ff50-3">Fig.&#x00A0;50-3</a> and <a href="#tt50-1">Table&#x00A0;50-1</a>). This cycle is typically 28 days in length, but there are many normal variations (from 21 to 42 days). In the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;proliferative phase:&lt;/b&gt; stage in the menstrual cycle before ovulation when the endometrium increases">proliferative phase</button></strong> at the beginning of the cycle (just after menstruation), FSH output increases, and estrogen secretion is stimulated. This causes the endometrium to thicken and become more vascular. In the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;secretory phase:&lt;/b&gt; stage of the menstrual cycle in which the endometrium becomes thickened, becomes more vascular, and ovulation occurs">secretory phase</button></strong> near the middle portion of the cycle (day <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1644" title="1644"></span>14 in a 28-day cycle), LH output increases, and ovulation occurs. Under the combined stimulus of estrogen and progesterone, the endometrium reaches the peak <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;luteal phase:&lt;/b&gt; stage in the menstrual cycle in which the endometrium becomes thicker and more vascular">luteal phase</button></strong>, in which the endometrium is thick and highly vascular. In the luteal phase, which begins after ovulation, progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum.</p>

<p class="indent">If the ovum is fertilized, estrogen and progesterone levels remain high, and the complex hormonal changes of pregnancy follow. If the ovum has not been fertilized, FSH and LH output diminishes; estrogen and progesterone secretion falls; the ovum disintegrates; and the endometrium, which has become thick and congested, becomes hemorrhagic. The product, menstrual flow, consisting of old blood, mucus, and endometrial tissue, is discharged through the cervix and into the vagina. After the menstrual flow stops, the cycle begins again; the endometrium proliferates and thickens from estrogenic stimulation, and ovulation recurs (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>

It usually occurs between 41 and 59 years of age (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). Perimenopause precedes this and can begin as early as 35 years of age. Physical, emotional, and menstrual changes may occur, and this transition offers another opportunity for health promotion and disease prevention education and counseling. Menopause is a normal part of aging and maturation. Menstruation ceases, and because the ovaries are no longer active, the reproductive organs become smaller. No more ova mature; therefore, no ovarian hormones are produced. (An earlier menopause may occur if the ovaries are surgically removed or are destroyed by radiation or chemotherapy or because of an unknown etiology.) Multifaceted changes also occur throughout the woman&#x2019;s body. These changes are neuroendocrine, biochemical, and metabolic and are related to normal maturation or aging (see <a href="#tt50-2">Table&#x00A0;50-2</a>).</p>
