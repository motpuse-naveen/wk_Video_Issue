<h4 class="h4" id="s1845">Hepatitis C Virus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Blood transfusions and sexual contact once accounted for most cases of HCV in the United States, but other parenteral means, such as sharing of contaminated needles by those who use IV or injection drugs and unintentional needlesticks and other injuries in health care workers now account for a significant number of cases. In 2017, a total of 3186 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported to the CDC. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, an estimated 44,300 acute hepatitis C cases occurred in 2017. Approximately 2.5 million people in the United States are living with HCV, making it the most common chronic bloodborne infection nationally, though many of those infected are unaware of the disease (CDC, 2017). The highest prevalence of HCV is in adults 40 to 59 years of age; in this age group, its prevalence is highest among African Americans. In 2017, 17,253 U.S. death certificates had HCV recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death but it has been suggested that deaths from this cause are underestimated (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>). HCV is the underlying cause of about one third of cases of HCC, and it is one of the most common reason for liver transplantation (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">People who are at particular risk for HCV include those who use IV or injection drugs, people who are sexually active with multiple partners, patients receiving frequent transfusions, those who require large volumes of blood, and health care personnel (see <a href="#ct43-8">Chart 43-8</a>). The incubation period is variable and may range from 15 to 160 days. The clinical course of acute HCV is similar to that of HBV; symptoms are usually mild or absent. However, a chronic carrier state occurs frequently, and there is an increased risk of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or liver cancer, after HCV. It is for this reason that those in high- and moderate-risk groups as well as those known to have high prevalence rates (e.g., those born in certain countries or regions) be screened for HCV <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1391" title="1391"></span>as well as for HBV (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). Small amounts of alcohol taken regularly appear to cause progression of the disease. Therefore, alcohol and medications that may affect the liver should be avoided.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no benefit from rest, diet, or vitamin supplements. The treatment for HCV infection has evolved since the introduction of highly effective HCV protease inhibitor therapies in 2011. Currently available therapies can achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) defined as the absence of detectable virus 12 weeks after completion of treatment; an SVR is indicative of a cure of HCV infection. Over 90% of persons infected with HCV can be cured of HCV infection regardless of HCV genotype (there are over 67 identified subtypes but type 1 is most common), with 8 to 12 weeks of oral therapy (CDC, 2017). HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAA) including simeprevir plus sofosbuvir, ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, and ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir packaged with dasabuvir have fewer side effects, shorter treatment durations, and higher cure rates than previously recommended antiviral agents. A newer dual combination that includes another derivative of daclatasivir with sofosbuvir is equally effective against all HCV genotypes (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>). Prescribers must take into account the degree of cirrhosis in individual patients in order to determine the most appropriate protease inhibitor. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">AASLD, 2020</a>) recommends regimens of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or sofusbuvir/velpatasvir for those patients who meet the criteria for simplified HCV treatment that includes treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis or those with compensated cirrhosis. The choice of medication is dependent on the genotype as well (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">AASLD, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are HCV treatments in development that are expected to be more effective in curing the disease and better tolerated with fewer adverse effects and contraindications (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>). As a result of the rapidly changing landscape for treatment of viral infections, it is important to monitor related websites for the most up-to-date recommendations (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>). A key challenge remains how to deliver the currently expensive DAA drugs to all global carriers of HCV (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Houghton, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Screening of blood has reduced the incidence of HCV associated with blood transfusion, and public health programs are helping to reduce the number of cases associated with shared needles in IV or injection drug use (see <a href="c43-sec12.xhtml#ct43-5">Chart 43-5</a>).</p>
