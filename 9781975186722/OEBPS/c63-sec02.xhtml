<h4 class="h4" id="s3004">Brain Injury</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The most important consideration in any head injury is whether the brain is injured. Even seemingly minor injury can cause significant brain damage secondary to obstructed blood flow and decreased tissue perfusion. The brain cannot store oxygen or glucose to any significant degree. Because the cerebral cells need an uninterrupted blood supply to obtain these nutrients, irreversible brain damage and cell death occur if the blood supply is interrupted for even a few minutes. A <strong>traumatic brain injury, closed (blunt)</strong> occurs when the head accelerates and then rapidly decelerates or collides with another object (e.g., a wall, the dashboard of a car) and brain tissue is damaged but there is no opening through the skull and dura. A <strong>traumatic brain injury, open (penetrating)</strong> occurs when an object penetrates the skull, enters the brain, and damages the soft brain tissue in its path or when blunt trauma to the head is so severe that it opens the scalp, skull, and dura to expose the brain.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3005">Types of Brain Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Injuries to the brain can be focal or diffuse. Focal injuries include contusions and several types of hematomas. Concussions and DAI are the major diffuse injuries (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Contusion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In cerebral <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;contusion:&lt;/b&gt; blunt force injury to soft tissue (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; bruise)">contusion</button></strong>, the brain is bruised and damaged in a specific area because of severe acceleration&#x2013;deceleration force or blunt trauma. The impact of the brain against the skull leads to a contusion. Clinical manifestations of a contusion are dependent upon size, location, and the extent of surrounding cerebral edema. Although a contusion may occur in any area of the brain, most are usually located in the anterior portions of the frontal and temporal lobes, around the sylvian fissure, and at the orbital areas; less commonly, contusions are located at the parietal and occipital areas.</p>
<p class="indent">Contusions can be characterized by loss of consciousness associated with stupor and confusion. The effects of injury, particularly hemorrhage and edema, peak after about 18 to 36 hours. These effects, which can cause secondary effects resulting in an increased ICP and possible herniation syndromes, are most pronounced in temporal lobe contusions. Patients are most often managed medically with interventions directed toward prevention of additional insults. Deep contusions are more often associated with hemorrhage and destruction of the reticular activating fibers, altering arousal (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intracranial Hemorrhage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hematomas are collections of blood in the brain that may be epidural (above the dura), subdural (below the dura), or intracerebral (within the brain) (see <a href="#ff63-2">Fig. 63-2</a>). Major symptoms are frequently delayed until the hematoma is large enough to cause distortion of the brain and increased ICP. The signs and symptoms of cerebral ischemia resulting from compression by a hematoma are variable and depend on the speed with which vital areas are affected and the area that is injured. A rapidly developing hematoma, even if small, may be fatal, whereas a larger but slowly developing one may allow compensation for increases in ICP.</p>
<p class="h7">Epidural Hematoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">After a head injury, blood may collect in the epidural (extradural) space between the skull and the dura mater. This can result from a skull fracture that causes a rupture or laceration of the middle meningeal artery, the artery that runs between the dura and the skull inferior to a thin portion of temporal bone. Hemorrhage from this artery causes rapid pressure in the brain. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2059" title="2059"></span>Epidural hematomas (EDHs) account for approximately 2.7% to 4% of traumatic head injuries (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff63-2">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff63-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff63-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;63-2 &#x2022;</span> Location of epidural, subdural, and intracerebral hematomas.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Symptoms are caused by the expanding hematoma. EDHs are often characterized by a brief loss of consciousness, followed by a lucid interval in which the patient is awake and conversant. During this lucid interval, compensation for the expanding hematoma takes place by rapid absorption of CSF and decreased intravascular volume, both of which help to maintain the ICP within normal limits. When these mechanisms can no longer compensate, even a small increase in the volume of the blood clot produces a marked elevation in ICP. The patient then becomes increasingly restless, agitated, and confused as the condition progresses to coma. Then, often suddenly, signs of herniation appear (usually deterioration of consciousness and signs of focal neurologic deficits, such as dilation and fixation of a pupil or paralysis of an extremity), and the patient&#x2019;s condition deteriorates rapidly. The most common type of herniation syndrome associated with an EDH is uncal herniation causing pressure on the midbrain (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An EDH is considered an extreme emergency; marked neurologic deficit or even respiratory arrest can occur within minutes. Treatment consists of making openings through the skull (burr holes; see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, <a href="c61-sec03.xhtml#ff61-8">Fig. 61-8</a>) to decrease ICP emergently, remove the clot, and control the bleeding. A craniotomy may be required to remove the clot and control the bleeding. A drain is usually inserted after creation of burr holes or a craniotomy to prevent reaccumulation of blood.</p>
<p class="h7">Subdural Hematoma (SDH)</p>
<p class="nonindent">An SDH is a collection of blood between the dura and the brain, a space normally occupied by a thin cushion of fluid. The most common cause is trauma, but it can also occur as a result of coagulopathies or rupture of an aneurysm. An SDH is more frequently venous in origin and is caused by the rupture of small vessels that bridge the subdural space (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Vacca &#x0026; Argento, 2018</a>). SDHs may be acute or chronic depending on the size of the involved vessel and the amount of bleeding in the CT scan.</p>
<p class="h8">Acute SDH</p>
<p class="nonindent">An acute SDH is usually caused by some kind of head injury, typically a fall. Signs and symptoms include changes in the level of consciousness (LOC), pupillary signs, and hemiparesis. There may be minor or even no symptoms with small collections of blood. Coma, increasing blood pressure, decreasing heart rate, and slowing respiratory rate are all signs of a rapidly expanding mass requiring immediate intervention.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient can be transported rapidly to the hospital, an immediate craniotomy is performed to open the dura, allowing the subdural clot to be evacuated. Successful outcome also depends on the control of ICP and careful monitoring of respiratory function (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>). The mortality rate for patients with acute SDH is high because of associated brain damage (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Chronic SDH</p>
<p class="nonindent">A chronic SDH can develop from seemingly minor head injuries and is seen most frequently in older adults who are prone to this type of head injury due to brain atrophy, which is a consequence of the aging process (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Vacca &#x0026; Argento, 2018</a>). Seemingly minor head trauma may produce enough impact to shift the brain contents abnormally. The time between injury and onset of symptoms can be lengthy (e.g., 3 weeks to months), so the actual injury may be forgotten.</p>
<p class="indent">A chronic SDH can resemble other conditions&#x2014;for example, it may be mistaken for a stroke. The bleeding is less profuse, but compression of the intracranial contents still occurs. The blood within the brain changes in character in 2 to 4 days, becoming thicker and darker. In a few weeks, the clot breaks down and has the color and consistency of motor oil. Eventually, calcification or ossification of the clot takes place. The brain adapts to this foreign body invasion, and the clinical signs and symptoms fluctuate. Symptoms include severe headache, which tends to come and go; alternating focal neurologic signs; personality changes; mental deterioration; and focal seizures (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Vacca &#x0026; Argento, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The treatment for a chronic SDH consists of surgical evaluation for evacuation of the clot. Consideration must be made for reversal of coagulopathies and iatrogenic anticoagulation (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Vacca &#x0026; Argento, 2018</a>). The operative procedure may be carried out through multiple burr holes, or a craniotomy may be performed for a sizable subdural mass that cannot be suctioned or drained through burr holes.</p>
<p class="h7">Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Hematoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the parenchyma of the brain. It is commonly seen in head injuries when force is exerted to the head over a small area (e.g., missile injuries, bullet wounds, stab injuries). These hemorrhages within the brain may also result from the following:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Systemic hypertension, which causes degeneration and rupture of a vessel</p>

<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Complications of anticoagulant therapy</p>
<p class="indent">Nontraumatic causes of intracerebral hemorrhage are discussed in <a href="c62.xhtml">Chapter 62</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The onset may be insidious, beginning with the development of neurologic deficits, followed by headache. Management includes supportive care; control of ICP; and careful administration of fluids, electrolytes, and antihypertensive medications. Surgical intervention by craniotomy or craniectomy permits removal of the blood clot and control of hemorrhage but may not be possible because of the inaccessible location of the bleeding or the lack of a clearly circumscribed area of blood that can be removed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Concussion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;concussion:&lt;/b&gt; a temporary loss of neurologic function with no apparent structural damage to the brain">concussion</button></strong> is a temporary loss of neurologic function with no apparent structural damage to the brain. Of the 1.7 million TBIs that occur in the United States each year, it is estimated that approximately 80% of them are concussions, also referred to as &#x201C;mild TBI&#x201D; (CDC, 2019). The mechanism of injury is usually blunt trauma from an acceleration&#x2013;deceleration force, a direct blow, or a blast injury. If brain tissue in the frontal lobe is affected, the patient may exhibit bizarre irrational behavior, whereas involvement of the temporal lobe can produce temporary amnesia or disorientation.</p>
<p class="indent">The duration of mental status abnormalities is an indicator of the grade of the concussion. The patient is discharged from the hospital or ED once they return to baseline after a concussion. Monitoring includes observing the patient for a decrease in LOC, worsening headache, dizziness, seizures, abnormal pupil response, vomiting, irritability, slurred speech, and numbness or weakness in the arms or legs (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4424">Silverberg, Iaccarino, Panenka, et al., 2020</a>). The occurrence of these symptoms is a red flag indicating the need for further intervention. Recovery may appear complete, but long-term sequelae are possible and repeat injuries are common.</p>
<p class="indent">Repeated concussive incidents can lead to a syndrome known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This syndrome has been recognized in those participating in contact sports such as football and boxing. The presentation is similar to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, characterized by personality changes, memory impairment, and speech and gait disturbances. Imaging findings show gross cerebral, particularly temporal lobe, atrophy (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Turk &#x0026; Budson, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">DAI results from widespread shearing and rotational forces that produce damage throughout the brain&#x2014;to axons in the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, and brain stem. The injured area may be diffuse with no identifiable focal lesion. DAI is associated with prolonged traumatic coma; it is more serious and is associated with a poorer prognosis than a focal lesion. The patient with DAI in severe head trauma experiences no lucid interval, immediate coma, decorticate and decerebrate posturing (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, <a href="c61-sec01.xhtml#ff61-1">Fig. 61-1</a>), and global cerebral edema. Diagnosis is made by clinical signs in conjunction with a CT or MRI scan (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4422">Schweitzer, Niogi, Whitlow, et al., 2019</a>). Recovery depends on the severity of the axonal injury.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3006">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment and diagnosis of the extent of injury are accomplished by the initial physical and neurologic examinations. CT and MRI scans are the main neuroimaging diagnostic tools and are useful in evaluating the brain structure (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Schweitzer et al., 2019</a>). Positron emission tomography (PET) is available in some trauma centers for assessing brain function.</p>
<p class="indent">Any patient with a head injury is presumed to have a cervical spine injury until proven otherwise. The patient is transported from the scene of the injury on a board with the head and neck maintained in alignment with the axis of the body. A cervical collar should be applied and maintained until cervical spine x-rays have been obtained and the absence of cervical SCI documented.</p>
<p class="indent">All therapy is directed toward preserving brain homeostasis and preventing secondary brain injury, which is injury to the brain that occurs after the original traumatic event. Common causes of secondary injury are cerebral edema, hypotension, and respiratory depression that may lead to hypoxemia and electrolyte imbalance. Treatments to prevent secondary injury include stabilization of cardiovascular and respiratory function to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion, control of hemorrhage and hypovolemia, and maintenance of optimal blood gas values.</p>
<p class="indent">Acute TBI treatment guidelines have been developed by the Brain Trauma Foundation. Adherence to these treatment guidelines may subsequently improve patient care and outcomes (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4420">Saherwala, Bader, Stutzman, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17a.png" alt=""/> Treatment of Increased Intracranial Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As the damaged brain swells with edema or as blood collects within the brain, an increase in ICP occurs; this requires aggressive treatment (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for a discussion on the relationship between ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP]). If the ICP remains elevated, it can decrease the CPP. Initial management is based on preventing secondary injury and maintaining adequate cerebral oxygenation (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Sacco &#x0026; Delibert, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery is required for evacuation of blood clots, d&#x00E9;bridement and elevation of depressed fractures of the skull, and suture of severe scalp lacerations. ICP is monitored closely; if increased, it is managed by maintaining adequate oxygenation, elevating the head of the bed, and maintaining normal blood volume (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4413">McCafferty, Neal, Marshall, et al., 2018</a>). Devices to monitor ICP or drain CSF can be inserted during surgery or at the bedside using aseptic technique. The patient is cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU), where expert nursing care and medical treatment are readily available.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Supportive Measures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment also includes ventilatory support, seizure prevention, fluid and electrolyte maintenance, nutritional support, and management of pain and anxiety. Patients who are comatose are intubated and mechanically ventilated to ensure adequate oxygenation and protect the airway.</p>
<p class="indent">Because seizures can occur after head injury and can cause secondary brain damage from hypoxia, anticonvulsant agents may be given. If the patient is very agitated, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used sedative agents which do not affect cerebral blood flow or ICP. Lorazepam and midazolam are frequently used but have active metabolites that may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2061" title="2061"></span>cause prolonged sedation, making it difficult to conduct a neurologic assessment. Propofol, a sedative&#x2013;hypnotic agent that is supplied in an intralipid emulsion for intravenous (IV) use, is the sedative of choice. It is an ultrashort-acting, rapid-onset drug with elimination half-life of less than an hour. It has a major advantage of being titratable to its desired clinical effect but still provides the opportunity for an accurate neurologic assessment (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A nasogastric tube may be inserted, because reduced gastric motility and reverse peristalsis are associated with head injury, making regurgitation and aspiration common in the first few hours.</p>

<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct63-3"><strong>Chart 63-3 <img class="m" src="images/icon20watch.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>How Can Advocacy Be Assured for a Patient Who Is Undocumented and Incapacitated?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">J.S. is a 24-year-old man who is undocumented and undomiciled. He was brought to the hospital by ambulance after falling from a 20-foot-high scaffold at a construction site 2 days ago. You are J.S.&#x2019;s nurse in the intensive care unit (ICU). According to J.S.&#x2019;s assigned medical social worker, a coworker on the work site where J.S. fell followed him to the hospital post injury. Information gathered from the coworker included that J.S. was working as a day laborer and was sending money to his parents in Honduras. J.S. reportedly speaks no English and only some Spanish; his primary language is native Honduran Moskitu. Despite aggressive interventions, including emergent craniotomy, ventriculostomy placement, and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, J.S. has remained unresponsive to all stimuli since admission to the ICU, with a current Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. The consulting neurologist has opined that J.S. will not recover from his traumatic brain injury, and that he will either succumb to his injuries or remain in a persistent vegetative state (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>). The state where you work has a provision that two physicians may decide to withdraw life-sustaining therapy for patients who are unbefriended (i.e., without next of kin/surrogates) and decisionally incapacitated such as J.S. The attending physician intensivist assigned to J.S. tells you during her rounds that she intends to consult with another intensivist colleague so that J.S. is extubated, and wants you to prepare to assist them. You ask the intensivist if attempts should be made to find J.S.&#x2019;s parents to get their permission to withdraw treatment. The intensivist says to you &#x201C;How are we supposed to find them? And even if we do locate them, they do not speak English, and maybe they do not understand Spanish, either. How can we tell them what has happened and get them on board? For heaven&#x2019;s sake, we are not doing this man any favors by letting him linger like this!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">People from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and those who are racial and ethnic minorities are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality than those who are socioeconomically secure and White. No group is at greater risk for suffering health disparities than those who are undocumented and undomiciled. Patients who are undocumented will typically forego seeking treatment for anything other than a dire health emergency, as they typically are uninsured, not eligible for assistance programs, and risk deportation by seeing a health care provider.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Assume that the intensivist believes she is advocating for what is best for J.S. by withdrawing life support. What dangers might be inherent in this type of paternalistic attitude (i.e., <em>I know what is best for the patient</em>)?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>How might it be possible to ascertain what J.S.&#x2019;s wishes would be if he were not incapacitated? Is trying to determine this futile and needlessly prolonging his suffering?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might you mobilize to be of assistance to you, to J.S., and to J.S.&#x2019;s parents in Honduras? Do J.S.&#x2019;s parents have the right to know what has happened to their son? What if his parents are found, and want J.S. to continue life-sustaining treatments? Can they legitimately make that decision on his behalf?</p>

<h6 class="h6">Brain Death</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When a patient has sustained a severe head injury incompatible with life, the patient is a potential organ donor. The nurse may assist in the clinical examination for determination of brain death and in the process of organ procurement. The three cardinal signs of brain death on clinical examination are coma, the absence of brain stem reflexes, and apnea. Adjunctive tests, such as cerebral blood flow studies, electroencephalogram (EEG), transcranial Doppler, and brain stem auditory-evoked potential, are often used to confirm brain death (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The health care team provides information to the family and assists them with the decision-making process about end-of-life care (see the section Supporting Family Coping and <a href="#ct63-3">Chart 63-3</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Depending on the patient&#x2019;s neurologic status, the nurse may elicit information from the patient, from the family, or from witnesses or emergency rescue personnel. Although all usual baseline data may not be collected initially, the immediate health history should include the following questions:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When did the injury occur?</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What caused the injury? A high-velocity missile? An object striking the head? A fall?</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What was the direction and force of the blow?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A history of unconsciousness or amnesia after a head injury indicates a significant degree of brain damage, and changes that occur minutes to hours after the initial injury can reflect recovery or indicate the development of secondary brain damage. The nurse should determine if there was a loss of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2062" title="2062"></span>consciousness, the duration of the unconscious period, and if the patient could be aroused.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to asking questions that establish the nature of the injury and the patient&#x2019;s condition immediately after the injury, the nurse examines the patient thoroughly. This assessment includes determining the patient&#x2019;s LOC using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and assessing the patient&#x2019;s response to tactile stimuli (if unconscious), pupillary response to light, corneal and gag reflexes, and motor function (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4427">Teasdale &#x0026; Jennett, 1974</a>). The GCS (see <a href="#ct63-4">Chart 63-4</a>) is based on the three criteria of eye opening, verbal responses, and motor responses to verbal commands or painful stimuli. It is particularly useful for monitoring changes during the acute phase, the first few days after a head injury. It does not take the place of an indepth neurologic assessment.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Detailed assessments are made initially and at frequent intervals throughout the acute phase of care (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Monitoring of ICP is crucial to decision making for patients with neurologic injuries, yet research findings indicate that proper training and a standard guideline is necessary to correctly document ICP (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4411">Liu, Griffith, Jang, et al., 2020</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, <a href="c61-sec02.xhtml#ct61-2">Chart 61-2</a>). Baseline and ongoing assessments are critical in nursing assessment of the patient with brain injury, whose condition can worsen dramatically and irrevocably if subtle signs are overlooked (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Sacco &#x0026; Davis, 2019</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Urden, Stacy, &#x0026; Lough, 2018</a>).

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient may include maintenance of a patent airway, adequate CPP, fluid and electrolyte balance, adequate nutritional status, prevention of secondary injury, maintenance of body temperature within normal limits, maintenance of skin integrity, improvement of coping, prevention of sleep deprivation, effective family coping, increased knowledge about the rehabilitation process, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nursing interventions for the patient with a TBI are extensive and diverse. They include making nursing assessments, setting priorities for nursing interventions, anticipating needs and complications, and initiating rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">AINTAINING THE</span> A<span class="small">IRWAY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">One of the most important nursing goals in the management of head injury is to establish and maintain an adequate airway. The brain is extremely sensitive to hypoxia, and a neurologic deficit can worsen if the patient is hypoxic. Therapy is directed toward maintaining optimal oxygenation to preserve cerebral function. An obstructed airway causes carbon dioxide retention and hypoventilation, which can produce cerebral vessel dilation and increased ICP (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Interventions to ensure an adequate exchange of air are discussed in <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> and include the following (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>):</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Maintaining the patient who is unconscious in a position that facilitates drainage of oral secretions, with the head of the bed elevated about 30 degrees to decrease intracranial venous pressure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Establishing effective suctioning procedures (pulmonary secretions produce coughing and straining, which increase ICP)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Guarding against aspiration and respiratory insufficiency</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Closely monitoring arterial blood gas values to assess the adequacy of ventilation. The goal is to keep blood gas values within normal limits to ensure adequate cerebral blood flow</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Monitoring the patient who is receiving mechanical ventilation for pulmonary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient who is intubated is at high risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia and providing good oral hygiene can help prevent this complication (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Gallagher, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ONITORING</span> N<span class="small">EUROLOGIC</span> F<span class="small">UNCTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients with severe TBI are admitted to the ICU for close assessment and monitoring (cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, and temperature monitoring). Parameters are assessed initially and as frequently as the patient&#x2019;s condition requires. As soon as the initial assessment is made, the use of a neurologic observational flow record is started and maintained. The importance of ongoing assessment and monitoring of the patient with brain injury cannot be overstated.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Level of Consciousness.</span> The GCS is used to assess LOC at regular intervals, because changes in the LOC precede all other changes in vital and neurologic signs. The patient&#x2019;s best responses to predetermined stimuli are recorded (see <a href="#ct63-4">Chart 63-4</a>). Each response is scored (the greater the number, the better the functioning), and the sum of these scores gives an indication of the severity of coma and a prediction of possible outcome. The lowest score is 3 (least responsive); the highest is 15 (most responsive). A GCS score between 3 and 8 is generally accepted as indicating a severe head injury (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt"><em>The GCS is considered the most sensitive indicator of a lapse in neurologic functioning in patients with TBI and is often the earliest sign of acute change in ICP.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Vital Signs.</span> Although a change in LOC is the most sensitive neurologic indication of deterioration of the patient&#x2019;s condition, vital signs are also monitored at frequent intervals to assess the intracranial status. <a href="#tt63-1">Table 63-1</a> depicts the general assessment parameters for the patient with a head injury.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Signs of increasing ICP include bradycardia (slowing of the heart rate), increasing systolic blood pressure, and widening pulse pressure (Cushing&#x2019;s reflex). As brain compression increases, respirations become rapid, the blood pressure may decrease, and the pulse slows further. This is an ominous development, as is a rapid fluctuation of vital signs (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The temperature is maintained at less than 38&#x00B0;C (100.4&#x00B0;F) (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Young &#x0026; Prescott, 2019</a>). Tachycardia and arterial hypotension may indicate that bleeding is occurring elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img class="m" src="images/icon29cma.png" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt"><em>In a patient with a head injury, a rapid increase in body temperature is regarded as unfavorable because hyperthermia increases the metabolic demands of the brain and may indicate brain stem damage&#x2014;a poor prognostic sign.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Motor Function.</span> Motor function is assessed frequently by observing spontaneous movements, asking the patient to raise and lower the extremities, and comparing the strength and equality of the upper and lower extremities at periodic intervals. To assess upper extremity strength, the nurse instructs the patient to squeeze the examiner&#x2019;s fingers tightly. The nurse assesses lower extremity motor strength by placing the hands on the soles of the patient&#x2019;s feet and asking the patient to push down against the examiner&#x2019;s hands. Examination of the motor system is discussed in more detail in <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>. The presence or absence of spontaneous movement of each extremity is also noted, and speech and eye signs are assessed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient does not demonstrate spontaneous movement, responses to painful stimuli are assessed (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Motor response to pain is assessed by applying a central stimulus, such as pinching the pectoralis major muscle, to determine the patient&#x2019;s best response. Peripheral stimulation may provide inaccurate assessment data because it may result in a reflex movement rather than a voluntary motor response. Abnormal responses (lack of motor response; extension responses) are associated with a poorer prognosis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Other Neurologic Signs.</span> The size and equality of the pupils and their reaction to light need to be continuously assessed. A unilaterally dilated and poorly responding pupil may indicate a developing hematoma, with subsequent pressure on the third cranial nerve due to shifting of the brain. If both pupils become fixed and dilated, this indicates acute injury and intrinsic damage to the upper brain stem and is a poor prognostic sign (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with a head injury may develop deficits such as anosmia (lack of sense of smell), eye movement abnormalities, aphasia, memory deficits, and posttraumatic seizures or epilepsy. Patients may be left with residual psychological deficits (impulsiveness; emotional lability; or uninhibited, aggressive behaviors) and, as a consequence of the impairment, may lack insight into their emotional responses.</p>

<p class="processppara">Brain damage can produce metabolic and hormonal dysfunctions. The monitoring of serum electrolyte levels is important, especially in patients receiving osmotic diuretics, those with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion, and those with posttraumatic diabetes insipidus.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Serial studies of blood and urine electrolytes and osmolality are carried out because head injuries may be accompanied by disorders of sodium regulation. Hyponatremia is common after head injury due to shifts in extracellular fluid, electrolytes, and volume. Hyperglycemia, for example, can cause an increase in extracellular fluid that lowers sodium. Hypernatremia may also occur as a result of sodium retention that may last several days, followed by sodium diuresis. Increasing lethargy, confusion, and seizures may be the result of electrolyte imbalance.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Endocrine function is evaluated by monitoring serum electrolytes, blood glucose values, and intake and output. Urine is tested regularly for acetone. A record of daily weights is maintained, especially if the patient has hypothalamic involvement and is at risk for the development of diabetes insipidus.</p>

<p class="processppara">Head injury results in metabolic changes that increase calorie consumption and nitrogen excretion. Protein demand increases. Early initiation of nutritional therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with head injury. Patients with brain injury are assumed to be catabolic, and nutritional support consultation should be considered as soon as the patient is admitted. Parenteral nutrition via a central line or enteral feedings given via a nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding tube should be considered, though enteral is the preferred route (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). If CSF rhinorrhea occurs or if there is any suspicion of disruption to the skull base, an oral feeding tube should be inserted instead of a nasal tube.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Laboratory values should be monitored closely in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Elevating the head of the bed can help prevent distention, regurgitation, and aspiration. A continuous-drip infusion or pump may be used to regulate the feeding. Enteral or parenteral feedings are usually continued until the swallowing reflex returns and the patient can meet caloric requirements orally. See <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for the principles and technique of enteral feedings.</p>

<p class="processppara">Often, as the patient emerges from coma, a period of lethargy and stupor is followed by a period of agitation. Each phase is variable and depends on the person, the location of the injury, the depth and duration of coma, and the patient&#x2019;s age. Restlessness may be caused by hypoxia, fever, pain, or a full bladder. It may indicate injury to the brain but may also be a sign that the patient is regaining consciousness. (Some restlessness may be beneficial because the lungs and extremities are exercised.) Agitation may also be the result of discomfort from catheters, IV lines, restraints, and repeated neurologic checks. Alternatives to restraints must be used whenever possible.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Strategies to prevent injury include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assessing the patient to ensure that oxygenation is adequate, and the bladder is not distended. Dressings and casts are checked for constriction</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Using padded side rails or wrapping the patient&#x2019;s hands in mitts to protect the patient from self-injury and dislodging of tubes. Restraints are used judiciously because straining against them can increase ICP or cause other injury. Enclosed or floor-level specialty beds may be indicated</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2066" title="2066"></span>Avoiding opioids as a means of controlling restlessness, because they depress respiration, constrict the pupils, and alter responsiveness</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Reducing environmental stimuli by keeping the room quiet, limiting visitors, speaking calmly, and providing frequent orientation information (e.g., explaining where the patient is and what is being done)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Providing adequate lighting to prevent visual hallucinations</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Minimizing disruption of the patient&#x2019;s sleep&#x2013;wake cycles</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lubricating the patient&#x2019;s skin with oil or emollient lotion to prevent irritation due to rubbing against the sheet</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Using an external sheath catheter for a male patient if incontinence occurs. Because prolonged use of an indwelling catheter inevitably produces infection, the patient may be placed on an intermittent catheterization schedule.</p>

<p class="processppara">Fever in the patient with a TBI can be the result of damage to the hypothalamus, cerebral irritation from hemorrhage, or infection. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s temperature every 2 to 4 hours. If the temperature increases, efforts are made to identify the cause and to control it using acetaminophen and cooling devices to maintain normothermia. Cooling devices should be used with caution so as not to induce shivering, which increases ICP. If infection is suspected, potential sites of infection are cultured, and antibiotic agents are prescribed and administered. Research about therapeutic hypothermia for patients with TBI suggests there is no clear evidence to guide therapy (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4434">Watson, Shepherd, Rhodes, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4435">Weng, Yang, Huang, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with TBI often require assistance in turning and positioning because of immobility or unconsciousness. Prolonged pressure on the tissues decreases circulation and leads to tissue necrosis. Potential areas of breakdown need to be identified early to avoid the development of pressure injuries. Specific nursing measures include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assessing all body surfaces and documenting skin integrity every 8 hours</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Turning and repositioning the patient every 2 hours</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Providing skin care every 4 hours</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assisting the patient to get out of bed to a chair three times a day</p>

<p class="processppara">Although many patients with head injury survive because of resuscitative and supportive technology, they frequently have ineffective coping due to cognitive sequelae. Cognitive impairment includes memory deficits; decreased ability to focus and sustain attention to a task (distractibility); impulsivity; egocentricity; and slowness in thinking, perceiving, communicating, reading, and writing. Psychiatric, emotional, and relationship problems develop in many patients after head injury. Resulting psychosocial, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive impairments are devastating to the family as well as to the patient (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4416">Oyesanya, Arulselvam, Thompson, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">These problems require collaboration among many disciplines. A neuropsychologist (specialist in evaluating and treating cognitive problems) plans a program and initiates therapy or counseling to help the patient reach maximal potential. Cognitive rehabilitation activities help the patient devise new problem-solving strategies. The retraining is carried out over an extended period and may include the use of sensory stimulation and reinforcement, behavior modification, reality orientation, computer training programs, and video games. Assistance from many disciplines is necessary during this phase of recovery. Even if intellectual ability does not improve, social and behavioral abilities may improve.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient recovering from a TBI may experience fluctuations in the level of cognitive function, with orientation, attention, and memory frequently affected. Many types of sensory stimulation programs have been tried, and research on these programs is ongoing (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). When pushed to a level greater than the impaired cortical functioning allows, the patient may show symptoms of fatigue, anger, and stress (headache, dizziness). The Rancho Los Amigos Scale: Levels of Cognitive Functioning is frequently used to assess cognitive function and evaluate ongoing recovery from head injury. Progress through the levels of cognitive function can vary widely for individual patients (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4408">Hagen, Malkmus, &#x0026; Durham, 1972</a>). Nursing management and a description of each level are included in <a href="#tt63-2">Table 63-2</a>.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients who require frequent monitoring of neurologic status may experience sleep deprivation as they are awakened hourly for assessment of LOC. To allow the patient longer times of uninterrupted sleep and rest, the nurse can group nursing care activities so that the patient is disturbed less frequently. Environmental noise is decreased, and the room lights are dimmed. Measures to increase comfort may promote sleep and rest (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4407">Giusti, Tuteri, &#x0026; Mirella, 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Having a loved one sustain a TBI produces a great deal of stress in the family. This stress can result from the patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional deficits, the unpredictable outcome, and altered family relationships. Families report difficulties in coping with changes in the patient&#x2019;s temperament, behavior, and personality (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4416">Oyesanya et al., 2019</a>). Such changes are associated with disruption in family cohesion, loss of leisure pursuits, and loss of work capacity, as well as social isolation of the caretaker. The family may experience marital disruption, anger, grief, guilt, and denial in recurring cycles.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">To promote effective coping, the nurse can ask the family how the patient is different now, what has been lost, and what is most difficult about coping with this situation. Helpful interventions include providing family members with accurate and honest information and encouraging them to continue to set well-defined short-term goals. Family counseling helps address the family members&#x2019; acute feelings of loss and helplessness and gives them guidance for the management of inappropriate behaviors. Support groups help the family members share problems, develop insight, gain information, network, and gain assistance in maintaining realistic expectations, hope, and a good quality of life (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4416">Oyesanya et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The Brain Injury Association of America (see the Resources section) serves as a clearinghouse for information and resources for patients with head injuries and their families, including specific information on coma, rehabilitation, behavioral consequences of head injury, and family issues. This organization can provide names of facilities and professionals who work with patients with head injuries and can assist families in organizing local support groups.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Many patients with severe head injury die of their injuries, and many of those who survive experience long-term disability that prevents them from resuming their previous roles and functions. During the most acute phase of injury, family members need factual information and support from the health care team.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Many patients with severe head injuries that result in brain death are young and otherwise healthy and are therefore considered for organ donation. Family members of patients with such injuries need support during this extremely stressful time and assistance in making decisions to end life support and permit donation of organs. They need to know that the patient who is brain dead and whose respiratory and cardiovascular systems are maintained through life support is not going to survive and that the severe head injury, not the removal of the patient&#x2019;s organs or the removal of life support, is the cause of the patient&#x2019;s death. Bereavement counselors and members of the organ procurement team are often immensely helpful to family members in making decisions about organ donation and in helping them cope with stress.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Decreased Cerebral Perfusion Pressure.</span> Maintenance of adequate CPP is important to prevent serious complications of head injury due to decreased cerebral perfusion. Adequate CPP is greater than 50 mm Hg. If CPP falls below a patient&#x2019;s threshold, a vasodilating cascade occurs, causing the volume of blood to increase inside the brain, which causes ICP to increase. Measures to maintain adequate CPP are essential because a decrease in CPP can impair cerebral perfusion and cause brain hypoxia and ischemia, leading to permanent brain damage. Once the threshold CPP is reached, vasoconstriction of the cerebral blood vessels occurs, causing ICP to decrease. Therapy (e.g., elevation of the head of the bed, increased IV fluids, CSF drainage) is directed toward decreasing cerebral edema and increasing venous outflow from the brain. Systemic hypotension, which causes vasoconstriction and a significant decrease in CPP, is treated with increased IV fluids or vasopressors (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4412">Livesay, McNett, Keller, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Cerebral Edema and Herniation.</span> The patient with a head injury is at risk for additional complications such as increased ICP and brain stem herniation. Cerebral edema is the most common cause of increased ICP in the patient with a head injury, with the swelling peaking approximately 48 to 72 hours after injury. Bleeding also may increase the volume of contents within the rigid, closed compartment of the skull, causing increased ICP and herniation of the brain stem and resulting in irreversible brain anoxia and brain death (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Vijay &#x0026; Jaison, 2019</a>). ICP is measured continuously and nursing interventions such as turning and suctioning have been associated with variation in the ICP (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4415">Olson, Parcon, Santos, et al., 2017</a>). Measures to control ICP are listed in <a href="#ct63-5">Chart 63-5</a> and discussed in <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Impaired Oxygenation and Ventilation.</span> Impaired oxygenation and ventilation may require mechanical ventilatory support. The patient must be monitored for a patent airway, altered breathing patterns, and hypoxemia and pneumonia.

<p class="processpparapindent">Undernutrition is also a common problem in response to the increased metabolic needs associated with severe head injury. Decisions about early feeding should be individualized; options include IV hyperalimentation or placement of a feeding tube (jejunal or gastric). Caloric expenditure can increase up to 120% to 140% with TBI, requiring close monitoring of nutritional status, with a higher concentration of protein if tolerated (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Quintard &#x0026; Ichai, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Posttraumatic Seizures.</span> Patients with head injury are at an increased risk for posttraumatic seizures. Posttraumatic seizures are classified as immediate (within 24 hours after injury), early (within 1 to 7 days after injury), or late (more than 7 days after injury) (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Seizure prophylaxis is the practice of administering anticonvulsant medications to patients with head injury to prevent seizures. It is important to prevent posttraumatic seizures, especially in the immediate and early phases of recovery, because seizures may increase ICP and decrease oxygenation (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4398">Chartrain, Yaeger, Feng, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4438">Zaman, Dubiel, Driver, et al., 2017</a>). However, many anticonvulsant medications impair cognitive performance and can prolong the duration of rehabilitation. Therefore, the overall benefits of these medications must be weighed against their side effects. Research evidence supports the use of prophylactic anticonvulsant agents to prevent immediate and early seizures after head injury, but not for prevention <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2069" title="2069"></span>of late seizures (<a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Chartrain et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c63-sec03.xhtml#bib4447">Zaman et al., 2017</a>). See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for the nursing management of seizures.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Education early in the course of head injury often focuses on reinforcing information given to the family about the patient&#x2019;s condition and prognosis. As the patient&#x2019;s status and expected outcome change over time, family education may focus on interpretation and explanation of changes in the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological responses.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Once the patient&#x2019;s physical status allows discharge to home, a rehabilitation center, or a subacute care facility, the patient and family are educated about limitations that can be expected and complications that may occur. The nurse explains to the patient and family, verbally and in writing, how to monitor for complications that merit contacting the primary provider. Depending on the patient&#x2019;s prognosis and physical and cognitive status, the patient may be included in education about self-care management strategies.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient is at risk for late posttraumatic seizures, anticonvulsant medications may be prescribed at discharge. The patient and family require education about the side effects of these medications and the importance of continuing to take them as prescribed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The rehabilitation phase of care for the patient with a TBI begins at hospital admission. Admission to the rehabilitation unit is a milestone in a patient&#x2019;s recovery and requires intense work by the patient to complete the daily schedule of therapies. The goals of rehabilitation are to maximize the patient&#x2019;s ability to return to their highest level of functioning and to their home and the community, address concerns before discharge for a smooth transition to home or rehabilitation, and promote independence with adaptation to deficits. The patient is encouraged to continue the rehabilitation program after discharge, because improvement in status may continue 3 or more years after injury. Changes in the patient with a TBI and the effects of long-term rehabilitation on the family and their coping abilities need ongoing assessment. Continued education and support of the patient and family are essential as their needs and the patient&#x2019;s status change. Education to address with the family of the patient who is about to return home is described in <a href="#ct63-6">Chart 63-6</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Depending on status, the patient is encouraged to return to usual activities gradually. Referral to support groups and to the Brain Injury Association of America may be warranted (see the Resources section).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During the acute and rehabilitation phases of care, the focus of education is on obvious needs, issues, deficits, and complications. Complications after TBI include infections (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection [UTI], sepsis, wound infection, osteomyelitis, meningitis, ventriculitis, brain abscess) and heterotopic ossification (painful bone overgrowth in weight-bearing joints).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse reminds the patient and family of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices after the initial phase of care. Patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers.</p>
