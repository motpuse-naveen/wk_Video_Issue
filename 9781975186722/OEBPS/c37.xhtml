<p class="nonindent">Unintentional injury is the third leading cause of death in the United States (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2745">Kochanek, Murphy, Xu, et al., 2019</a>). Unintentional injuries are commonly called <em>accidents;</em> however, this term is considered inaccurate by trauma professionals. The term <em>accident</em> infers that there is no potential for prevention; yet, health care professionals understand that prevention plays a major role in decreasing the rate of unintentional injuries. The implementation of evidence-based primary prevention policies (e.g., mandatory use of seat belts for drivers and passengers in motor vehicles) may prevent many unintentional injuries from occurring.</p>
<p class="indent">Trauma is a frequent cause of musculoskeletal injury and is among the most common reasons for people to seek medical attention (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2695">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], National Center for Health Statistics, 2017</a>). Therefore, nurses who work in emergency departments (EDs), critical care units, and inpatient medical-surgical units frequently encounter patients who have experienced musculoskeletal trauma. The management of musculoskeletal injuries frequently includes the use of casts, splints, braces, traction, surgery, or a combination of these. Nursing care is planned to maximize the effectiveness of these treatment modalities and to prevent potential complications associated with each of the interventions. However, upon discharge from the hospital, many of these patients require extensive periods of rehabilitation and follow-up. Thus, nurses who work in rehabilitation centers, long-term care facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, occupational health settings, and primary care clinics may all care for patients with musculoskeletal injuries.</p>
