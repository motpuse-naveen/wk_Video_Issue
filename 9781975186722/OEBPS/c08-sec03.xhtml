<h4 class="h4" id="s155">Mental Health Problems in the Older Adult</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Severe mood swings, uncontrolled laughing or crying, changes in cognitive ability, and excessive forgetfulness are not a part of normal aging. These symptoms should not be dismissed as age-related changes; a thorough assessment may reveal a treatable, reversible condition. Changes in mental status can be related to many factors, such as alterations in diet and fluid and electrolyte balance, fever, or low oxygen levels associated with many cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Older adults are less likely than younger people to acknowledge or seek treatment for mental health symptoms. Changes may be reversible when the underlying condition is identified and treated. Nurses must recognize, assess, refer, collaborate, treat, and support older adults who exhibit signs and symptoms of depression, substance abuse, delirium, or dementia.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Nursing Strategies for Improving Medication Management and Adherence</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following strategies can help patients manage their medications and improve adherence:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assess self-management abilities, psychomotor skills, and current medication knowledge.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Destroy or remove old, unused medications.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encourage the use of standard containers without safety lids (if there are no children in the household).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encourage the patient to inform the primary provider about the use of OTC medications and herbal agents, alcohol, and recreational drugs.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encourage the patient to keep a current list of all medications, including OTC and herbal medications, in their purse or wallet to share with the primary provider at each visit and in case of an emergency.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Explain the purpose, adverse effects, and dosage of each medication, particularly those that are newly prescribed.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the patient&#x2019;s competence is doubtful, identify a reliable family member or friend who might assist the patient with adherence.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Provide the medication schedule in writing.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Reconcile medication schedule upon discharge from hospital or rehabilitation facility.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recommend using one supplier for prescriptions; pharmacies frequently track patients and are likely to notice a prescription problem such as duplication or contraindications in the medication regimen.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Suggest the use of a multiple-day, multiple-dose medication dispenser to help the patient adhere to the medication schedule.</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s156">Depression</h3>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;depression:&lt;/b&gt; the most common affective (mood) disorder of old age; results from changes in reuptake of the neurochemical serotonin in response to chronic illness and emotional stresses">Depression</button></strong> is the most common affective or mood disorder of old age (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). The percentage of older adults with depressive symptoms varies widely depending upon the measures used and the population studied. Estimates range from 15% to 25% in community-dwelling older adults, and up to 25% of those living in long-term care facilities (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Depression among older adults can follow a major precipitating event or loss and is often related to chronic illness or pain. It may also be secondary to a medication interaction or an undiagnosed physical condition. Rather than obvious sadness, an older person may exhibit more subtle signs of depression such as fatigue, diminished memory and concentration, feelings of worthlessness, sleep disturbances, appetite disturbances with excessive weight loss or gain, restlessness, impaired attention span, and suicidal ideation. Mild depression with symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depression is often underrecognized and undertreated, which results in reduced quality of life and function (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The risk of suicide is increased in older adults. There is a need for routine assessment of patients for depression and risk for suicide. Geriatric depression may be confused with dementia. However, the cognitive impairment resulting from depression is related to apathy rather than decline in brain function. When depression and medical illnesses coexist, as they often do, neglect of the depression can impede physical recovery. Assessing the patient&#x2019;s mental status, including depression, is vital and must not be overlooked. A commonly used assessment tool is the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib587">Yesavage, Brink, Rose, et al., 1983</a>). (See <a href="#ct8-6">Chart&#x00A0;8-6</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults with depression can respond appropriately to treatment. Initial management involves evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s medication regimen and eliminating or changing any medications that contribute to depression. Furthermore, treatment of underlying medical conditions that may produce depressive symptoms may alleviate the depression. For mild depression, nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise, bright lighting, increasing interpersonal interactions, cognitive therapy, and reminiscence therapy are effective. However, for major depression, antidepressants and short-term psychotherapy, particularly in combination, are effective in older adults. Antidepressants, such as bupropion hydrobromide, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and mirtazapine, as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine hydrochloride, can be effective (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Tricyclic antidepressants can be useful for treating major depression in some patients. Electroconvulsive therapy is highly effective when antidepressant medications are not tolerated, not effective, or pose a significant medical risk (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most antidepressant medications have anticholinergic, cardiac, and orthostatic adverse effects (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). They also interact with other medications and, therefore, should be used with care to avoid medication toxicity, hypotensive events, and falls. Older patients prescribed antidepressants should be carefully monitored for side effects. Good patient education is needed to make sure older adults understand that it may take even longer than the typical 4 to 6 weeks for symptoms to diminish. During this period, nurses should offer support, encouragement, and strategies to maintain safety, such as changing positions slowly and maintaining adequate hydration (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s157">Substance Use Disorder</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Substance use disorders caused by misuse of alcohol and drugs may be related to depression. A national survey indicated that between 7% and 14% of adults age 65 and older reported alcohol abuse, dependence, binge drinking, or were at least at risk for alcohol dependence (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). Approximately 50% of adults age 65 and older drink alcohol on a regular basis (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Kennedy-Malone et al., 2019</a>). Moderate alcohol consumption has shown to have positive health benefits, such as lowering the risks for cardiovascular disease. Alcohol abuse is especially dangerous in older adults because of age-related changes in renal and liver function as well as the high risk of interactions with prescription medications and the resultant adverse effects. Alcohol and drug misuse in older adults often remains hidden because many older adults deny their habit when questioned. Using screening tools may help provide a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive method for screening alcohol misuse. Alcohol use should be addressed during routine physical examinations (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Resnick, 2019</a>). See <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for more information and specific assessment tools.</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s158">Delirium</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Delirium occurs secondary to numerous causes, including physical illness, surgery, medication or alcohol toxicity, dehydration, fecal impaction, malnutrition, infection, head trauma, lack of environmental cues, and sensory deprivation or overload. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to acute confusion because of their decreased biologic reserve and the large number of medications they may take. Nurses must recognize the symptoms of delirium and report them immediately. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a commonly used screening tool (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib567">Inouye, van Dyck, Alessi, et al., 1990</a>). (See <a href="#ct8-7">Chart&#x00A0;8-7</a>.) Because of the acute and unexpected onset of symptoms and the unknown underlying cause, delirium is a medical emergency. If the delirium goes unrecognized and the underlying cause is not treated, permanent, irreversible brain damage or death can follow.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s159">Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease</h3>
<p class="nonindent">AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. For adults 65 years of age and older it is the fifth leading cause of death. AD is a progressive, irreversible, degenerative neurologic disease that begins insidiously and is characterized by gradual losses of cognitive function and disturbances in behavior and affect. AD can occur in people as young as 40 years of age but is less common before 65 years of age. Although the prevalence of AD increases dramatically with increasing age, affecting as many as half of those 85 years and older, AD is not a normal part of aging. Without a cure or any preventive measures, it is estimated that 13.8 million Americans will have this disease by 2050 (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib550">Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous theories about the cause of age-related cognitive decline. Although the greatest risk factor for AD is increasing age, many environmental, dietary, and inflammatory factors also may determine whether a person suffers from this cognitive disease. AD is a complex brain disorder caused by a combination of various factors that may include genetics, neurotransmitter changes, vascular abnormalities, stress hormones, circadian changes, head trauma, and the presence of seizure disorders.</p>
<p class="indent">AD can be classified into two types: familial or early-onset AD and sporadic or late-onset AD (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <a href="c06-sec04.xhtml#tt6-5">Table&#x00A0;6-5</a>). Familial AD is rare, accounting for less than 2% of all cases, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page183" title="183"></span>and is frequently associated with genetic mutations. It can occur in middle-aged adults. If family members have at least two other relatives with AD, then there is a familial component, which may include both environmental triggers and genetic determinants (NIH, 2017).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s160">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathogenesis of AD is uncertain but the disease includes specific neuropathologic and biochemical changes that interfere with neurotransmission. These changes consist of neurofibrillary tangles (tangled masses of nonfunctioning neurons) and senile or neuritic plaques (deposits of amyloid protein, part of a larger protein called <em>amyloid precursor protein</em> in the brain). The neuronal damage occurs primarily in the cerebral cortex and results in decreased brain size. Similar changes are found in the normal brain tissue of nonsymptomatic older adults, although to a lesser extent. Cells that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine are principally affected by AD. At the biochemical level, the enzyme active in producing acetylcholine, which is specifically involved in memory processing, is decreased.</p>
<p class="indent">Scientists have been studying complex neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and have focused on two key issues: whether a gene might influence a person&#x2019;s overall risk of developing the disease, and whether a gene might influence some particular aspect of a person&#x2019;s risk, such as the age at which the disease begins (age at onset). There are genetic differences in early- and late-onset forms of AD (NIH, 2017). Researchers are investigating what predisposes people to develop the plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that can be seen at autopsy in the brains of patients with AD. Understanding the complex ways in which aging as well as genetic and nongenetic factors affect brain cells over time, eventually leading to AD, continues to increase.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s161">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the early stages of AD, forgetfulness and subtle memory loss occur. Patients may experience small difficulties in work or social activities but have adequate cognitive function to compensate for the loss and continue to function independently. With further progression of AD, the deficits can no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page184" title="184"></span>longer be concealed. Forgetfulness is manifested in many daily actions; patients may lose their ability to recognize familiar faces, places, and objects and they may become lost in a familiar environment. They may repeat the same stories or ask the same question repeatedly. Trying to reason with people with AD and using reality <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orientation:&lt;/b&gt; a person&#x2019;s ability to recognize who and where they are in a time continuum; used to evaluate one&#x2019;s basic cognitive status">orientation</button></strong> (a person&#x2019;s ability to recognize who and where they are in a time continuum) only increase their anxiety without increasing function. Conversation becomes difficult, and word-finding difficulties occur. The ability to formulate concepts and think abstractly disappears&#x2014;for example, a patient can interpret a proverb only in concrete terms. Patients are often unable to recognize the consequences of their actions and, therefore, exhibit impulsive behavior&#x2014;for example, on a hot day a patient may decide to wade in the city fountain fully clothed. Patients have difficulty with everyday activities, such as operating simple appliances and handling money.</p>
<p class="indent">Personality changes are also usually evident. Patients may become depressed, suspicious, paranoid, hostile, and even combative. Progression of the disease intensifies the symptoms: Speaking skills deteriorate to nonsense syllables, agitation and physical activity increase, and patients may wander at night. Eventually, assistance is needed for most ADLs, including eating and toileting, because dysphagia and incontinence develop. The terminal stage, in which patients are usually immobile and require total care, may last months or years. Occasionally, patients may recognize family members or caregivers. Death occurs as a result of complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition, or dehydration.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s162">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A definitive diagnosis of AD can be made only at autopsy; however, an accurate clinical diagnosis can be made in the majority of cases. The most important goal is to rule out other causes of dementia that are reversible, such as depression, delirium, alcohol or drug abuse, or inappropriate drug dosage or drug toxicity. AD is a diagnosis of exclusion; a diagnosis of probable AD is made when the medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests have excluded all known causes of other dementias.</p>
<p class="indent">The health history&#x2014;including medical history, family history, social and cultural history, and medication history&#x2014;and the physical examination, including functional and mental health status, are essential to the diagnosis of probable AD. Diagnostic tests, including complete blood count, chemistry profile, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and thyroid hormone levels, as well as screening with electroencephalography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), may all refute or support a diagnosis of probable AD.</p>
<p class="indent">Depression can closely mimic early-stage AD and coexists in many patients. Therefore, assessing the patient for underlying depression is important. The GDS is a useful tool to assess for depression (see <a href="#ct8-6">Chart&#x00A0;8-6</a>). Tools such as the MMSE (see <a href="c08-sec02.xhtml#ct8-3">Chart&#x00A0;8-3</a>) are useful for assessing cognitive status and screening for AD. Both CT and MRI of the brain are useful for excluding hematoma, brain tumor, stroke, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, and atrophy but are not reliable in making a definitive diagnosis of AD. Infections and physiologic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, can cause cognitive impairment that may be misdiagnosed as AD. Biochemical abnormalities can be excluded through examination of the blood and CSF.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s163">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In AD, the primary goal is to help maintain mental function as well as manage the cognitive and behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of the disease. Although there is no cure, several medications slow the progression of the disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil hydrochloride and rivastigmine tartrate, for example, enhance acetylcholine uptake in the brain, thus maintaining memory skills for a period of time. Cognitive ability may improve within 6 to 12 months of therapy. Rivastigmine is indicated for severe AD and it is recommended that treatment continue as long as possible (NIH, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Behavioral problems such as agitation and psychosis can be managed by behavioral and other interventions such as music therapy (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib584">Weise, Jakob, T&#x00F6;pfer, et al., 2018</a>). Associated depression and behavioral problems can also be treated pharmacologically if other interventions fail. Because symptoms change over time, all patients with AD should be reevaluated routinely, and the nurse should document and report both positive and negative responses to medications.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s164">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses play an important role in the recognition of AD, particularly in hospitalized older adults, by assessing for signs (e.g., repeating or asking the same thing over and over). Nursing interventions for AD are aimed at promoting patient function and independence for as long as possible. Other important goals include promoting the patient&#x2019;s physical safety, promoting independence in self-care activities, reducing anxiety and agitation, improving communication, providing for socialization and intimacy, promoting adequate nutrition, promoting balanced activity and rest, and supporting and educating family caregivers. These nursing interventions apply to all patients with AD, regardless of cause.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Supporting Cognitive Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because dementia of any type is degenerative and progressive, patients display a decline in cognitive function over time. In the early phase of dementia, minimal cuing and guidance may be all that are needed for the patient to function fairly independently for a number of years. However, as the patient&#x2019;s cognitive ability declines, family members must provide more and more assistance and supervision. A calm, predictable environment helps people with dementia interpret their surroundings and activities. Environmental stimuli are limited, and a regular routine is established. A quiet, pleasant manner of speaking, clear and simple explanations, and the use of memory aids and cues help minimize confusion and disorientation and give patients a sense of security. Prominently displayed clocks and calendars may enhance orientation to time. Color-coding the doorway may help patients who have difficulty locating their room. Active participation may help patients maintain cognitive, functional, and social interaction abilities for a longer period. Physical activity and communication have also been demonstrated to slow some of the cognitive decline of AD.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Physical Safety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A safe home and hospital environment allow the patient to move about as freely as possible and relieves the family of constant worry about safety. For the patient residing at home, in order to prevent falls and other injuries, all obvious hazards are removed and hand rails are installed. A hazard-free environment allows the patient maximum independence and a sense of autonomy. Adequate lighting, especially in halls, stairs, and bathrooms, is necessary. Nightlights are helpful, particularly if the patient has increased confusion at night, sometimes referred to as sundowning. Driving is prohibited, and smoking is allowed only with supervision. The patient may have a short attention span and be forgetful; therefore, the nurse and the family must be patient, repeat instructions as needed, and use reminders (i.e., post-it notes, electronic reminders) for daily activities. Doors leading from the house must be secured. Outside the home, all activities must be supervised to protect the patient, and the patient should wear some type of identification in case of separation from the caregiver.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is hospitalized, additional precautionary measures should be taken. Wandering behavior, which may be worse in the hospital due to unfamiliar surroundings, can often be reduced by gentle persuasion, distraction, or by placing the patient close to the nursing station. Restraints should be avoided because they can increase agitation and lead to injury.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Independence in Self-Care Activities</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pathophysiologic changes in the brain make it difficult for people with AD to maintain physical independence. Patients should be assisted to remain functionally independent for as long as possible. One way to do this is to simplify daily activities by organizing them into short, achievable steps so that the patient experiences a sense of accomplishment. Frequently, occupational therapists can suggest ways to simplify tasks or recommend adaptive equipment. Direct patient supervision is sometimes necessary; however, maintaining personal dignity and autonomy is important for people with AD, who should be encouraged to make choices when appropriate and to participate in self-care activities as much as possible.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Anxiety and Agitation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Despite profound cognitive losses, patients are sometimes aware of their diminishing abilities. Patients need constant emotional support that reinforces a positive self-image. When loss of skills occurs, goals are adjusted to fit the patient&#x2019;s declining ability.</p>
<p class="indent">The environment should be kept familiar and noise free. Excitement and confusion can be upsetting and may precipitate a combative, agitated state known as a catastrophic reaction (overreaction to excessive stimulation). The patient may respond by screaming, crying, or becoming abusive (physically or verbally); this may be the patient&#x2019;s only way of expressing an inability to cope with the environment. When this occurs, it is important to remain calm and unhurried. Forcing the patient to proceed with the activity only increases the agitation. It is better to postpone the activity until later, even to another day. Frequently, the patient quickly forgets what triggered the reaction. Measures such as moving to a familiar environment, listening to music, stroking, rocking, or distraction may quiet the patient. Research suggests that the use of activities and music therapy, both individualized and in groups, help decrease agitation (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib588">Zhang, Cai, An, et al., 2017</a>). Becoming familiar with a particular patient&#x2019;s usual responses to certain stressors helps caregivers avoid stressful situations.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Improving Communication</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To promote the patient&#x2019;s interpretation of messages, the nurse should remain unhurried and reduce noises and distractions. Use of clear, easy-to-understand sentences to convey messages is essential because patients frequently forget the meaning of words or have difficulty organizing and expressing thoughts. In the earlier stages of dementia, lists and simple written instructions that serve as reminders may be helpful. In later stages, the patient may be able to point to an object or use nonverbal language to communicate. Tactile stimuli, such as hugs or hand pats, are usually interpreted as signs of affection, concern, and security.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing for Socialization and Intimacy Needs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because socialization with friends can be comforting, visits, letters, and phone calls are encouraged. Recreation is important, and people with dementia are encouraged to participate in simple activities. Realistic goals for activities that provide satisfaction are appropriate. Hobbies and activities such as walking, exercising, and socializing can improve quality of life. The nonjudgmental friendliness of a pet may provide stimulation, comfort, and contentment. Care of plants or a pet can also be satisfying and an outlet for energy.</p>
<p class="indent">AD does not eliminate the need for intimacy. Patients and their spouses may continue to enjoy sexual activity. Spouses should be encouraged to talk about any sexual concerns, and sexual counseling may be necessary. Simple expressions of love, such as touching and holding, are often meaningful.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Adequate Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Mealtime can be a pleasant social occasion or a time of upset and distress, and it should be kept simple and calm, without confrontations. Patients prefer familiar foods that look appetizing and taste good. Cueing may be necessary to encourage adequate nutrition and hydration. Food is cut into small pieces to prevent choking. Liquids may be easier to swallow if they are thickened. Hot food and beverages are served warm, and the temperature of the foods should be checked to prevent burns.</p>
<p class="indent">When lack of coordination interferes with self-feeding, adaptive equipment is helpful (see <a href="#ff8-4">Fig.&#x00A0;8-4</a>). Some patients may do well eating with a spoon or with their fingers. If this is the case, an apron or a smock, rather than a bib, is used to protect clothing. As deficits progress, it may become necessary to feed the patient. Forgetfulness, disinterest, dental problems, lack of coordination, overstimulation, and choking all serve as barriers to good nutrition and hydration.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Balanced Activity and Rest</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients with dementia exhibit sleep disturbances, wandering, and behaviors that may be considered inappropriate. These behaviors are most likely to occur when there are unmet underlying physical or psychological needs. Caregivers must identify the needs of patients who are exhibiting these behaviors because further health decline may occur if the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page186" title="186"></span>source of the problem is not corrected. Adequate sleep and physical exercise are essential. If sleep is interrupted or the patient cannot fall asleep, music, warm milk, or a back rub may help the patient relax. During the day, patients should be encouraged to participate in exercise because a regular pattern of activity and rest enhances nighttime sleep. Long periods of daytime sleeping are discouraged.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The emotional burden on the families of patients with all types of dementia is enormous. The physical health of the patient is often very stable and the decline gradual. Family members may cling to the hope that the diagnosis is incorrect and that their relative will improve with greater effort. Family members provide at least 83% of the home care that is required by patients with AD (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib550">Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association, 2019</a>). They are faced with numerous difficult decisions (e.g., when the patient should stop driving, when to assume responsibility for the patient&#x2019;s financial affairs). Aggression and hostility exhibited by the patient are often misunderstood by caregivers, who may feel unappreciated, frustrated, and angry. Feelings of guilt, nervousness, and worry contribute to caregiver fatigue, depression, and family dysfunction. Researchers have identified that a Web-based intervention can be effective in helping with anxiety and stress, reducing depressive symptoms, and identifying care needs and planning interventions that promote balance and congruence in the lives of caregivers (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib575">Ploeg, Markle-Reid, Valaitis, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Neglect or abuse of the patient can occur, and this has been documented in home situations as well as in institutions. If neglect or abuse of any kind&#x2014;including physical, emotional, sexual, neglect, or financial abuse&#x2014;is suspected, the local adult protective services agency must be notified. The responsibility of the nurse is to report the suspected abuse, not to prove it.</p>
<p class="indent">The Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association is a coalition of family members and professionals who share the goals of family support and service, education, research, and advocacy. Family support groups, respite (relief) care, and adult day care may be available through different community resources, such as the Area Agency on Aging, in which concerned volunteers are trained to provide structure to caregiver support groups (see Resources section at the end of chapter). Respite care is a commonly provided service in which caregivers can get away from the home for short periods while someone else tends to the needs of the patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s165">Vascular Dementia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and is characterized by an uneven, stepwise downward decline in mental function (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Norris, 2019</a>). Multi-infarct dementia, the most common form of vascular dementia, has an unpredictable course and is characterized by variable impairment depending on the affected sites in the brain. The patient may present with a deficit in only one domain such as word retrieval whereas other cognitive abilities may be intact. Diagnosis may be even more difficult if a patient has both vascular dementia and AD.</p>
<p class="indent">Because vascular dementia is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, risk factors (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, smoking, heart disease, diabetes) are similar. Prevention and management are also similar (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>). Measures to decrease blood pressure, control diabetes, and lower cholesterol levels may slow cognitive decline.</p>
