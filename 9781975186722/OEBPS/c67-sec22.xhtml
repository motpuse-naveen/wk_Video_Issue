<h4 class="h4" id="s3218">Intra-Abdominal Injuries</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Intra-abdominal injuries are categorized as penetrating or blunt trauma. <em>Penetrating</em> abdominal injuries (i.e., gunshot wounds, stab wounds) are serious and usually require surgery. Penetrating abdominal trauma results in a high incidence of injury to hollow organs, particularly the small bowel. The liver is the most frequently injured solid organ due to its size and anterior placement in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. In gunshot wounds, the most important prognostic factor is the velocity at which the missile enters the body. High-velocity missiles (bullets) produce extensive tissue damage. All abdominal gunshot wounds that cross the peritoneum require surgical exploration. On the other hand, some stab wounds may be managed nonoperatively due to low velocity and less penetration of the implement (i.e., weapon) (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Blunt trauma</em> to the abdomen may result from motor vehicle crashes, falls, blows, or explosions. Blunt trauma is commonly associated with extra-abdominal injuries to the chest, head, or extremities. Patients with blunt trauma pose a challenge because injuries may be difficult to detect. The incidence of delayed and trauma-related complications is greater than for penetrating injuries. This is especially true of blunt injuries involving the liver, kidneys, spleen, or blood vessels, which can lead to massive blood loss into the peritoneal cavity (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3219">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As the history of the traumatic event is obtained, the abdomen is inspected as a part of the secondary survey for obvious signs of injury, including penetrating injuries, bruises, and abrasions. Abdominal assessment continues with auscultation of bowel sounds to provide baseline data from which changes can be noted. Absence of bowel sounds may be an early sign of intraperitoneal involvement, although stress can also decrease or halt peristalsis and thus bowel sounds. Further abdominal assessment may reveal progressive abdominal distention, involuntary guarding, tenderness, pain, muscular rigidity, or rebound tenderness along with changes in bowel <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2194" title="2194"></span>sounds, all of which are signs of peritoneal irritation. Hypotension and signs and symptoms of shock may also be noted. In addition, the chest and other body systems are assessed for injuries that frequently accompany intra-abdominal injuries (ENA, 2020a).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Improving Thermoregulation for Patients with Trauma</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Saqe-Rockoff, A., Schubert, F. D., Ciardiello, A., et al. (2018). Improving thermoregulation for trauma patients in the emergency department: An evidence-based practice project. <em>Journal of Trauma Nursing</em>, <em>25</em>(1), 14&#x2013;20.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Research indicates there is a strong association between increased mortality in patients with trauma and hypothermia. Therefore, hypothermia is an important modifiable risk factor for patients with trauma. A variety of rewarming methods currently exist and are utilized with varying degrees of success. Gaps in emergency nursing practice include the assessment of temperature as well as limited personnel knowledge regarding the management of patients with hypothermia and the utilization of rewarming techniques.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The setting was a 450 bed Level I trauma center with more than 75,000 annual ED visits. The project goals were to decrease time to temperature assessment upon patient arrival to the trauma bay and to improve use of best practice rewarming methods among patients with trauma. The research team utilized the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to provide a framework for the evaluation of current practice and implementation of best practices. Practice changes that were instituted on patients with trauma during the study period included providing warmed blankets, ensuring regulated standardized trauma bay temperature, assessing patient temperature on arrival with appropriate escalation of rewarming as needed, and using a rapid infuser with warmed fluid as needed. In order to implement these changes, a standardized protocol checklist was developed. The impact of the interventions was assessed by <em>post hoc</em> chart reviews. Data analysis included descriptive statistics for assessment of differences pre and post project implementation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">There were 193 patients with trauma during the study period. There was no appreciable difference in time to temperature assessment upon patient arrival to the trauma bay pre and post project implementation. However, there was an increase in patients identified with hypothermia post implementation and a significant increase in core temperature assessment from 4% to 23% (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001). Use of blankets in normothermic patients increased (<em>p</em> = 0.002). There was a significant increase in the average temperature of the trauma bay post implementation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses often identify lack of education, access to information, and lack of time as barriers for implementing evidence-based practice changes. Staff education and implementation of relatively simple tools such as the hypothermia checklist used in this study can encourage implementation of best practices and consistency of care of patients with trauma who are at risk for hypothermia. Incorporating best practices for thermoregulation of the patient with trauma may lead to improved patient outcomes and decreased mortality rates.</p>

<p class="indent">Laboratory studies that aid in assessment include the following:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to evaluate trends reflecting the presence or absence of bleeding</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Lactate to determine acidosis and need for continued resuscitation</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Arterial blood gas (ABG) for pH (acidosis), base deficit for resuscitation evaluation, and ventilation parameters (PaCO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub>)</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>International normalized ratio (INR) to identify coagulopathy or presence of pharmacologically induced anticoagulation</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>White blood cell (WBC) count to detect elevation (generally associated with trauma)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Internal Hemorrhage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hemorrhage frequently accompanies abdominal injury, especially if the liver or spleen has been traumatized. Therefore, the patient is assessed continuously for signs and symptoms of external and internal bleeding. The front of the body, flanks, and back are inspected for bluish discoloration, asymmetry, abrasion, and contusion. Abdominal CT scans permit detailed evaluation of abdominal contents and retroperitoneal examination. Abdominal ultrasounds can be used to rapidly assess patients who are hemodynamically unstable to detect intraperitoneal bleeding. This is referred to as the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination. During the resuscitation period, pain is managed using administration of small dosages of opioids (ENA, 2020a).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The location of pain can indicate certain types of intra-abdominal injuries. Pain in the left shoulder is common in a patient with bleeding from a ruptured spleen, whereas pain in the right shoulder can result from laceration of the liver.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Intraperitoneal Injury</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The abdomen is assessed for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, spasm, increasing distention, and pain. Referred pain is a significant finding because it suggests intraperitoneal injury. To determine if there is intraperitoneal injury and bleeding, the patient is usually prepared for diagnostic procedures, such as diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), abdominal ultrasonography, or abdominal CT scanning. DPL, although no longer the standard diagnostic study used to evaluate a traumatized abdomen, remains a viable backup procedure that is easily performed and is very useful during mass casualty incidents when CT scanners may not be readily available. DPL involves the instillation of 1 L of warmed lactated Ringer&#x2019;s or normal saline solution into the abdominal cavity. After a minimum of 400 mL has been returned, a fluid specimen is sent to the laboratory for analysis. Positive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2195" title="2195"></span>laboratory findings include a red blood cell count greater than 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; a WBC count greater than 500/mm<sup>3</sup>; or the presence of bile, feces, or food (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genitourinary Injury</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A focused genitourinary examination, which typically includes a rectal and vaginal examination, is performed to determine any injury to the pelvis, bladder, urethra, vagina, or intestinal wall. In the male patient, a high-riding prostate gland (abnormal position) discovered during a rectal examination indicates a potential urethral injury. A digital vaginal examination is performed on female patients to determine if there is an open pelvic fracture that has torn the vagina (ENA, 2020a).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>To decompress the bladder and monitor urine output in a patient with a genitourinary injury, an indwelling catheter is inserted after a rectal examination has been completed, not before the examination. In addition, urethral catheter insertion when a possible urethral injury is present is contraindicated; a urology consultation and further evaluation of the urethra are required.</em></p></div>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3220">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As indicated by the patient&#x2019;s condition, resuscitation procedures (restoration of airway, breathing, and circulation) are initiated as described previously.</p>
<p class="indent">With blunt trauma, the patient is kept on a stretcher to immobilize the spine. If the patient has been placed on a backboard, it should be removed as early as possible to prevent skin breakdown. Cervical spine immobilization is maintained until cervical x-rays have been obtained and cervical spine injury has been ruled out. Likewise, once the backboard is removed, logrolling can be used to protect the spine until x-rays are obtained and confirm that there is no evidence of injuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing the mechanism of injury (e.g., penetrating force from a gunshot or knife, blunt force from a blow) is essential to determining the type of management needed. All wounds are located, counted, and documented. If abdominal viscera protrude, the area is covered with sterile, moist saline dressings to keep the viscera from drying.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, oral fluids are withheld in anticipation of surgery, and the stomach contents are aspirated with an orogastric tube to reduce the risk of aspiration and to decompress the stomach in preparation for diagnostic procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">Trauma predisposes the patient to infection by disruption of mechanical barriers, exposure to exogenous bacteria from the environment at the time of injury, aspiration of vomitus, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (hospital-acquired infection). Tetanus prophylaxis and broad-spectrum antibiotics are given as prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout the stay in the ED, the patient&#x2019;s condition is continuously monitored for changes. If there is continuing evidence of shock, blood loss, free air under the diaphragm, evisceration, hematuria, severe head injury, musculoskeletal injury, or suspected or known abdominal injury, the patient is rapidly transported to surgery. In most cases, blunt liver and spleen injuries are managed nonsurgically. The goal for the management of all patients who have experienced trauma is to minimize the length of stay in the ED. The patient should be moved to the definitive destination quickly so that care and rehabilitation can continue (ENA, 2020a).</p>
