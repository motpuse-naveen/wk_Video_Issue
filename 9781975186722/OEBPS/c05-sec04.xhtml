<h4 class="h4" id="s85">Nursing Management</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Stress or the potential for stress is ubiquitous&#x2014;that is, it is both everywhere and anywhere. It is essential for all people, particularly student nurses, to engage in strategies for stress relief. Nursing students experience stressors that can negatively affect their academic and clinical performance (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib312">Kinchen &#x0026; Loerzel, 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct5-2">Chart&#x00A0;5-2</a>. Anxiety, frustration, anger, and feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, or powerlessness are emotions often associated with stress. In the presence of these emotions, the customary activities of daily living may be disrupted&#x2014;for example, a sleep disturbance may occur, eating and activity patterns may be altered, and family processes or role performance may be disrupted.</p>
<p class="indent">The optimal point of intervention to promote health is during the stage when a person&#x2019;s own compensatory processes are still functioning effectively. A major role of nurses is the early identification of both physiologic and psychological stressors. Nurses should be able to relate the presenting signs and symptoms of distress to the physiology they represent and identify a person&#x2019;s position on the continuum of function, from health and compensation to pathophysiology and disease.</p>
<p class="indent">In the assessment of people who seek health care, both objective signs and subjective symptoms are the primary indicators of existing physiologic processes. The following questions are addressed:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Are the heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature normal?</span></li>
<li><span>What emotional distress may be contributing to the patient&#x2019;s health problems?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there other indicators of steady-state deviation?</span></li>
<li><span>What are the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure, height, and weight?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any problems in movement or sensation?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any problems with affect, behavior, speech, cognitive ability, orientation, or memory?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there obvious impairments, lesions, or deformities?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Objective evidence can be obtained from laboratory data, such as electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, and urinalysis results. Further signs of injury are seen in diagnostic studies such as computed tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Further information on diagnostic evaluation can be found in assessment chapters of each unit of this book. Many nursing diagnoses are possible for patients suffering from stress. One nursing diagnosis associated with stress is anxiety, which is defined as a vague, uneasy feeling, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page110" title="110"></span>the source of which may be nonspecific or not known to the person. Stress may also be manifested as difficulty coping patterns, decisional conflict, or relationship problem. These human responses are reflected in the nursing diagnoses of anxiety, difficulty coping, and denial, all of which indicate poor adaptive responses. Other possible nursing diagnoses include social isolation, risk for spiritual distress, readiness for positive family processes, decisional conflict, lack of resilience, and risk for powerlessness, among others. Because human responses to stress are varied, as are the sources of stress, arriving at an accurate diagnosis allows interventions and goals to be more specific and leads to improved outcomes.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Nursing Students&#x2019; Attitudes and Use of Holistic Therapies for Stress Relief</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Kinchen, E. V., &#x0026; Loerzel, V. (2019). Nursing students&#x2019; attitudes and use of holistic therapies for stress relief. <em>Journal of Holistic Nursing, 37</em>(1), 6&#x2013;17.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this mixed methods research study was to determine nursing students&#x2019; openness to using or making recommendations to use holistic strategies to manage school or work stress, along with their perceptions of engaging in the use of holistic therapies for their own personal health.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In this quasi-experimental, mixed methods study, a convenience sample of nursing students was recruited from a senior undergraduate class and provided an email to obtain information about the study, the consent form, and the survey link. Participants completed the quantitative electronic survey and answered the accompanying three open-ended questions. The questions asked the participants about their personal use or recommendation to use holistic therapies for stress relief, the strategies they utilized for managing their stress, and their perceptions of the influence that holistic therapies have on personal health. Students who participated in the study were given two extra credit points; nonparticipants who desired to obtain the extra credit points were permitted to write a one-page essay as an alternative assignment on the holistic therapy of their choice.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The reported findings were only from the qualitative portion of the study. Of the 116 participants, 81 (70%) were very open or open to using or recommending holistic therapies, while 32 (28%) were somewhat open, and 3 (2%) were not open to using or recommending holistic modalities. From the data, eight categories of stress management activities were obtained: physical activity, prayer and meditation, time management, distraction, socialization, artistic/creative pursuits, interactions with animals, and other behaviors such as napping, taking a day off, stress eating, and crying. It was noted that 62% of the identified stress management actions are designated as holistic therapies. Overall, 85 of the participants (73%) held the view that holistic therapies had a positive influence on personal health, while 25 participants (22%) believed that holistic therapies had a potential influence on their health, and the remaining 6 (5%) perceived that holistic therapies had no effect on personal health. Four recurring themes were extracted from the data: wholeness, self-empowerment, relaxation/restoration, and alternative/complement to traditional medicine. The student participants were open to recommending these strategies to others. There also were barriers identified, such as a lack of knowledge and a lack of time, which interfered with using holistic methods for managing stress.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Information from this study supports that, in addition to the traditional behavioral health and pharmacologic interventions used for managing stress, many nursing students found holistic strategies useful for managing stress in their daily lives. This study lends support to the recommendations from many nursing organizations, such as the American Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA) and the American Nurses Association (ANA), to promote self-care and stress-relief strategies while providing students with the knowledge necessary to educate their patients about the use of holistic therapies. It is important for nursing education programs to establish and implement curriculum content and practical experiences related to holistic therapies.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Stress management is directed toward reducing and controlling stress and improving coping. The need to prevent illness, improve the quality of life, and decrease the cost of health care makes efforts to promote health essential, and stress control a significant health promotion goal. Stress reduction methods and coping enhancements can derive from either internal or external sources. For example, healthy eating habits and relaxation techniques are internal resources that help reduce stress, and a broad social network is an external resource that helps reduce stress. Goods and services that can be purchased are also external resources for stress management. It may be easier for people with adequate financial resources to cope with constraints in the environment, because their sense of vulnerability to threat is decreased compared to those without adequate financial resources.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s86">Promoting a Healthy Lifestyle</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A health-promoting lifestyle provides internal resources that aid in coping, and it buffers or cushions the impact of stressors. Lifestyles or habits that contribute to the risk of illness can be identified through a health risk appraisal, which is an assessment method designed to promote health by examining a person&#x2019;s habits and recommending changes when a health risk is identified.</p>
<p class="indent">Health risk appraisals involve the use of health risk questionnaires to estimate the likelihood that people with a given set of characteristics will become ill. People who receive this information may be influenced to adopt healthy behaviors (e.g., stop smoking, have periodic screening examinations) to improve their health. Questionnaires typically address the information presented in <a href="#ct5-3">Chart&#x00A0;5-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The personal information is compared with average population risk data, and the risk factors are identified and weighted. From this analysis, a person&#x2019;s risks and major health hazards are identified. Further comparisons with population data can estimate how many years will be added to a person&#x2019;s lifespan if the suggested changes are made. However, research has not yet demonstrated that providing people with such information ensures that they will change their behaviors. The single most important factor for determining health <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page111" title="111"></span>status is social class, and within a social class, research suggests that the major factor influencing health is level of education (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib281">Bastable, Gramet, Jacobs, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Bulechek, Butcher, Dochterman, and colleagues (2018) identified coping enhancement as a nursing intervention and defined it as handling perceived and actual stressors, changes, or threats that affect how one meets daily life demands and roles (<a href="#ct5-4">Chart&#x00A0;5-4</a>). The nurse can build on the patient&#x2019;s existing coping strategies, as identified in the health appraisal, or provide education about new strategies for coping if necessary.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The five predominant ways of coping with illness identified in a review of 57 nursing research studies were as follows (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib287">Jalowiec, 1993</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Trying to be optimistic about the outcome</span></li>
<li><span>Using social support</span></li>
<li><span>Using spiritual resources</span></li>
<li><span>Trying to maintain control either over the situation or over feelings</span></li>
<li><span>Trying to accept the situation</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Other ways of coping included seeking information, reprioritizing needs and roles, lowering expectations, making compromises, comparing oneself to others, planning activities to conserve energy, taking things one step at a time, listening to one&#x2019;s body, and using self-talk for encouragement.</p>

<p class="box5text"><span class="unfold"><strong>Skyler Hansen</strong></span> is an 18-year-old male recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He lives with his parents and two younger siblings and is active in high school sports. He now requires insulin injections, glucose monitoring, and a diabetic diet. Examine how the psychological, physical, and educational needs for managing a new diagnosis can be a great source of stress to the patient and the family. How can the nurse enhance his ability to cope with and adapt to diabetes management? (Skyler Hansen&#x2019;s story continues in <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>.)</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s88"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating About Relaxation Techniques</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Relaxation techniques are a major method used to relieve stress. The goal of using relaxation techniques is to produce a response that counters the stress response. When this goal is achieved, the action of the hypothalamus adjusts, decreasing sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity. The sequence of physiologic effects and their signs and symptoms are then interrupted, thus reducing psychological stress. This is a learned response and requires practice to achieve. Commonly used techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, the Benson relaxation response, and relaxation with guided imagery (all discussed later). Other relaxation techniques include meditation, breathing techniques, massage, Reiki, music therapy, biofeedback, and the use of humor.</p>
<p class="indent">The different relaxation techniques share four similar elements: (1) a quiet environment, (2) a comfortable position, (3) a passive attitude, and (4) a mental device (something on which to focus one&#x2019;s attention, such as a word, phrase, or sound).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing the muscles of the body in sequence and sensing the difference in feeling. It is best if the person lies on a soft cushion in a quiet room, breathing easily. Someone usually reads the instructions in a low tone in a slow and relaxed manner, or a recording of the instructions may be played. The person tenses the muscles in the entire body (one muscle group at a time), holds, senses the tension, and then relaxes. As each muscle group is tensed, the person keeps the rest of the body relaxed. Each time the focus is on feeling the tension and relaxation. When the exercise is completed, the entire body should be relaxed (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib282">Benson, 1993</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib284">Benson &#x0026; Stark, 1996</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">The Benson Relaxation Response</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The Benson relaxation response (<a href="#ct5-5">Chart&#x00A0;5-5</a>) combines meditation with relaxation. Along with the repeated word or phrase, a passive demeanor is essential. If other thoughts or distractions (noises, pain) occur, Benson recommends not fighting the distraction but simply continuing to repeat the focus phrase. Time of day is not important; however, the exercise works best on an empty stomach (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib282">Benson, 1993</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib283">Benson &#x0026; Proctor, 1984</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib284">Benson &#x0026; Stark, 1996</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Guided Imagery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Simple <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;guided imagery:&lt;/b&gt; the mindful use of a word, phrase, or visual image to achieve relaxation or direct attention away from uncomfortable sensations or situations">guided imagery</button></strong> is the mindful use of a word, phrase, or visual image for the purpose of distracting oneself from distressing situations or consciously taking time to relax or re-energize. A nurse can help a person select a pleasant scene or experience, such as watching the ocean or dabbling the feet in a cool stream. The image serves as the mental device in this technique. As the person sits comfortably and quietly, the nurse guides the person to review the scene, trying to feel and relive the imagery with all of the senses. A recording may be made of the description of the image, or commercial recordings for guided imagery and relaxation can be used.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s89"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating About Stress Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Two commonly prescribed nursing educational interventions&#x2014;providing sensory information and providing procedural information (e.g., preoperative education)&#x2014;aim to reduce stress and improve the patient&#x2019;s coping ability. This preparatory education includes giving structured content, such as a lesson in childbirth preparation to expectant parents, a review of how an implantable cardioverter defibrillator works to a patient with heart disease, or a description of sensations a patient will experience during cardiac catheterization. These techniques may alter the person&#x2013;environment relationship such that something that might have been viewed as harmful or a threat will now be perceived more positively. Giving patients information also reduces the emotional response so that they can concentrate and solve problems more effectively (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Kittleson, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Miller &#x0026; Stoeckel, 2017</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib322">Rhee, Marottoli, Van Ness, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Veterans have similar educational needs to nonveterans. Yet one study revealed that, in a postsecondary education setting, women service members and veterans received less health information compared to women who were not service members or veterans (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib295">Albright, Thomas, McDaniel, et al., 2019</a>). In this cross-sectional study, women service members and veterans received less education about alcohol and illicit drug use, depression and anxiety, sexual assault and relational violence prevention, and stress reduction. Nurses who work on college campuses should be attuned to the educational needs of women veterans.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s90">Promoting Family Health</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to individual concepts of homeostasis, stress, adaptation, and health problems associated with maladaptation, the concept of family is also important. Nurses can intervene with both individuals and families to reduce stress and its health-related effects. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;family:&lt;/b&gt; a group whose members are related by reciprocal caring, mutual responsibilities, and loyalties">family</button></strong> (group whose members are related by reciprocal caring, mutual responsibilities, and loyalties) plays a central role in the life of the patient and is a major part of the context of the patient&#x2019;s life. It is within families that people grow, are nurtured, acquire a sense of self, develop beliefs and values about life, and progress through life&#x2019;s developmental stages (<a href="#ff5-7">Fig.&#x00A0;5-7</a>). Families are also the first source for socialization and education about health and illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, the health care team conducts a careful and comprehensive family assessment (including coping style), develops interventions tailored to handle the stressors, implements <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page113" title="113"></span>the specified treatment protocols, and facilitates the construction of social support systems. The use of existing family strengths, resources, and education is augmented by therapeutic family interventions. The nurse&#x2019;s primary goals are to maintain and improve the patient&#x2019;s present level of health and to prevent physical and emotional deterioration. Next, the nurse intervenes in the cycle that the illness creates: patient illness, stress for other family members, new illness in other family members, and additional patient stress.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff5-7">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff5-7.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff5-7.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;5-7 &#x2022;</span> Within families, individuals progress through life&#x2019;s developmental stages.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Helping the family members manage the myriad stressors that bombard them daily involves working with family members to develop coping skills. Seven traits that enhance coping of family members under stress have been identified (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib286">Burr, Klein, Burr, et al., 1994</a>). Communication skills and spirituality were frequently useful traits. Cognitive abilities, emotional strengths, relationship capabilities, willingness to use community resources, and individual strengths and talents were also associated with effective coping. As nurses work with families, they must not underestimate the impact of their therapeutic interactions, educational information, positive role modeling, provision of direct care, and education on promoting health. Maladaptive coping may result if health care team members are not perceived as actively supporting family members. Often, denial and blaming of others occur. Sometimes, physiologic illness, emotional withdrawal, and physical distancing are the results of severe family conflict, violent behavior, or addiction to drugs and alcohol. Substance abuse may develop in family members who feel unable to cope or solve problems. People may engage in these dysfunctional behaviors when faced with difficult or problematic situations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s91">Enhancing Social Support</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nature of social support and its influence on coping have been studied extensively. Social support has been demonstrated to be an effective moderator of life stress. Such support has been found to provide people with several different types of emotional information (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib319">Nicks, Wray, Peavler, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib335">Warner, Roberts, Jeanblanc, et al., 2017</a>). The first type of information leads people to believe that they are cared for and loved. This emotional support appears most often in a relationship between two people in which mutual trust and attachment are expressed by helping each other to meet their emotional needs. The second type of information leads people to believe that they are esteemed and valued. This is most effective when others in a group recognize a person&#x2019;s favorable position within that group, demonstrating the person&#x2019;s value. Known as esteem support, this elevates the person&#x2019;s sense of self-worth. The third type of information leads people to feel that they belong to a network of communication and mutual obligation. Members of this network share information and make goods and services available to the members as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Social support also facilitates a person&#x2019;s coping behaviors; however, this depends on the nature of the social support. People can have extensive relationships and interact frequently; however, the necessary support comes only when people feel a deep level of involvement and concern, not when they merely touch the surface of each other&#x2019;s lives.</p>
<p class="indent">The critical qualities within a social network are the exchange of intimate communications and the presence of solidarity and trust.</p>
<p class="indent">Emotional support from family and significant others provides love and a sense of sharing the burden. The emotions that accompany stress are unpleasant and often increase in a spiraling fashion if relief is not provided. Being able to talk with someone and express feelings openly may help a person gain mastery of the situation. Nurses can provide this support but also must identify the person&#x2019;s social support system and encourage its use. People who are &#x201C;loners,&#x201D; who are isolated, or who withdraw in times of stress have a high risk of coping failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Because anxiety can also distort a person&#x2019;s ability to process information, it helps to seek information and advice from others who can assist with analyzing the threat and developing a strategy to manage it. Again, this use of others helps people maintain mastery of a situation and self-esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, social networks assist with management of stress by providing people with:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>A positive social identity</span></li>
<li><span>Emotional support</span></li>
<li><span>Material aid and tangible services</span></li>
<li><span>Access to information</span></li>
<li><span>Access to new social contacts and new social roles</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s92">Recommending Support and Therapy Groups</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Support groups exist especially for people in similar stressful situations. Groups have been formed by people with ostomies; women who have had mastectomies; and people with cancer or other serious diseases, chronic illness and disability. There are groups for single parents, substance abusers and their family members, homicide bereavement, and victims of child abuse. Professional, civic, and religious support groups are active in many communities (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib317">Mavandadi, Wray, &#x0026; Toseland, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Supiano &#x0026; Overfelt, 2018</a>).
