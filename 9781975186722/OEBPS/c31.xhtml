The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immune system:&lt;/b&gt; the collection of organs, cells, tissues, and molecules that mediate the immune response">immune system</button></strong> functions as the body&#x2019;s defense mechanism against invasion and allows a rapid response to foreign substances in a specific manner. Genetic and cellular responses result. Any qualitative or quantitative change in the components of the immune system can produce profound effects on the integrity of the human organism. Immune function is affected by a variety of factors, such as central nervous system integrity, general physical and emotional status, medications, dietary patterns, and the stress of illness, trauma, or surgery. Immune memory is a property of the immune system that provides protection against harmful microbial agents despite the timing of re-exposure to the agent. Tolerance is the mechanism by which the immune system is programmed to eliminate foreign substances such as microbes, toxins, and cellular mutations but maintains the ability to accept self-antigens. Some credence is given to the concept of surveillance, in which the immune system is in a perpetual state of vigilance, screening and rejecting any invader that is recognized as foreign to the host. The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immunopathology:&lt;/b&gt; study of diseases resulting in dysfunctions within the immune system">immunopathology</button></strong> refers to the study of diseases that result from dysfunctions within the immune system. Immune system dysfunctions can occur across the lifespan; many are genetically based, others are acquired. Disorders of the immune system may stem from excesses or deficiencies of immunocompetent cells, alterations in the function of these cells, immunologic attack on self-antigens, or inappropriate or exaggerated responses to specific antigens (<a href="#tt31-1">Table 31-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Primary immunodeficiencies and acquired immune disorders affect large numbers of the population. Thus, nurses in many practice settings need to understand how the immune system functions as well as immunopathologic processes. In addition, knowledge about assessment and care of people with immunologic disorders enables nurses to make appropriate management decisions.</p>
