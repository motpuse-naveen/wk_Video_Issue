<h4 class="h4" id="s1951">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Various hormones and chemicals are responsible for normal thyroid function. Key among them are thyroid hormone, calcitonin, and iodine.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1952">Thyroid Hormone</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Thyroid hormone is comprised of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>, two separate hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Both are amino acids that contain iodine molecules bound to the amino acid structure; T<sub>4</sub> contains four iodine atoms in each molecule, and T<sub>3</sub> contains three. These hormones are synthesized and stored bound to proteins in the cells of the thyroid gland until needed for release into the bloodstream. Three thyroid-binding hormones&#x2014;thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (formerly known as thyroid-binding prealbumin), and albumin&#x2014;bind and transport T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Synthesis of Thyroid Hormone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Iodine is essential to the thyroid gland for synthesis of its hormones. The major use of iodine in the body is by the thyroid, and the major derangement in iodine deficiency is alteration of thyroid function. Iodide is ingested in the diet and absorbed into the blood in the GI tract. The thyroid gland is extremely efficient at taking up iodide from the blood and concentrating it within the cells, where iodide ions are converted to iodine molecules, which react with tyrosine (an amino acid) to form the thyroid hormones (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regulation of Thyroid Hormone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The secretion of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> by the thyroid gland is controlled by TSH (also called <em>thyrotropin</em>) from the anterior pituitary gland. TSH controls the rate of thyroid hormone release through a negative feedback mechanism. In turn, the level of thyroid hormone in the blood determines the release of TSH. If the thyroid hormone concentration in the blood decreases, the release of TSH increases, which causes increased output of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>. The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;euthyroid:&lt;/b&gt; state of normal thyroid hormone production">euthyroid</button></strong> refers to thyroid hormone production that is normal.</p>
<p class="indent">TRH, secreted by the hypothalamus, exerts a modulating influence on the release of TSH from the pituitary. Environmental factors, such as a decrease in temperature, may lead to increased secretion of TRH, resulting in elevated secretion of thyroid hormones. Figure 45-4 shows the hypothalamic&#x2013;pituitary&#x2013;thyroid axis, which regulates thyroid hormone production.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Function of Thyroid Hormone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The main function of thyroid hormone is to control cellular metabolic activity. T<sub>4</sub>, a relatively weak hormone, maintains body metabolism in a steady state. T<sub>3</sub> is about five times as potent as T<sub>4</sub> and has a more rapid metabolic action. These hormones accelerate metabolic processes by increasing the level of specific enzymes that contribute to oxygen consumption and altering the responsiveness of tissues to other hormones. The thyroid hormones influence cell replication, are important in brain development, and are necessary for normal growth. Thyroid hormones affect virtually every major organ system and tissue function, including the basal metabolic rate, tissue thermogenesis, serum cholesterol levels, and vascular resistance (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1953">Calcitonin</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Calcitonin, or thyrocalcitonin, is another important hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. The hormone is secreted in response to high plasma levels of calcium, and it reduces the plasma level of calcium by increasing its deposition in bone.</p>

Thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine [T<sub>3</sub>] and thyroxine [T<sub>4</sub>]). High circulating levels of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> inhibit further TSH secretion and thyroid hormone production through a negative feedback mechanism (<em>dashed lines</em>).</p></figcaption></figure></div>
