<h4 class="h4" id="s900"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management: Valvuloplasty and Valve Replacement</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assists the patient and family to prepare for the procedure, reinforces and supplements explanations provided by the primary provider, and provides psychosocial support. (See Chapters 14 through 16 for care of the surgical patient.)</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have undergone percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty with or without percutaneous valve replacement may be admitted to a telemetry unit or intensive care unit (ICU). The nurse assesses for signs and symptoms of heart failure and emboli (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>), auscultates the chest for changes in heart sounds at least every 4 hours, and provides the patient with the same care as for postprocedure cardiac catheterization or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). After undergoing percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty, the patient usually remains in the hospital for 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have undergone surgical valvuloplasty or valve replacements are admitted to the ICU. Care focuses on recovery from anesthesia and hemodynamic stability. Vital signs are assessed every 5 to 15 minutes and as needed until the patient recovers from anesthesia or sedation, and then are assessed according to unit protocol. Intravenous (IV) medications may be used to increase or decrease blood pressure, to treat arrhythmias, to increase or decrease heart rate; and, their effects are monitored. Medications are gradually decreased until they are no longer required, or the patient takes the needed medication by another route (e.g., oral, topical). Patient assessments are conducted every 1 to 4 hours and as needed, with attention to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, Chart&#x00A0;23-11).</p>
<p class="indent">After the patient has recovered from anesthesia and sedation, is hemodynamically stable without the use IV medications, and has stable physical assessment parameters, they are usually transferred to a telemetry unit, typically within 24 to 72 hours of surgery. Nursing care continues as for most postoperative patients, including wound care and patient education regarding diet, activity, medications, and self-care. The patient usually is discharged from the hospital in 3 to 7 days.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient about anticoagulant therapy, explaining the need for frequent follow-up appointments and blood laboratory studies. Patients who take warfarin have individualized target international normalized ratios, usually between 2 and 3.5 for mitral valve replacement and 1.8 and 2.2 for aortic valve replacement. Patients who have been treated with an annuloplasty ring or a tissue valve replacement usually require anticoagulation for only 3 months unless there are other risk factors such as atrial fibrillation or a history of thromboembolism. Aspirin is prescribed with warfarin for patients with bioprostheses or at high risk for embolic events (e.g., history of embolic event or having two or more preexisting conditions: diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, older than 75 years) (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1834">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). The nurse provides education about all prescribed medications, including the name of medication, dosage, actions, prescribed schedule, potential adverse effects, and any drug&#x2013;drug or drug&#x2013;food interactions.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with a mechanical valve prosthesis (including annuloplasty rings and other prosthetic materials used in valvuloplasty) require education to prevent infective endocarditis. Patients may be at risk for infective endocarditis, caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and adhering to abnormal valve structures or prosthetic devices. The nurse educates the patient about how to minimize the risk of developing infective endocarditis (see prevention of endocarditis later in this chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">Transitional, home health, office, or clinic nurses help reinforce all new information and self-care instructions with patients and families for 4 to 8 weeks after the procedure (<a href="#ct24-1">Chart 24-1</a>). An echocardiogram may be performed 3 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge to further evaluate the effects and results of surgery. The echocardiogram also provides a baseline for future comparison if cardiac symptoms or complications develop. Echocardiograms usually are repeated every 1 to 2 years.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s901">Cardiomyopathy</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardiomyopathy:&lt;/b&gt; disease of the heart muscle">Cardiomyopathy</button></strong> is disease of the heart muscle that is associated with cardiac dysfunction. It is classified according to the structural and functional abnormalities of the heart muscle: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D), and unclassified cardiomyopathy (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1810">Elliott, Andersson, Arbustini, et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>). A patient may have pathology representing more than one of these classifications, such as a patient with HCM with restrictive physiology. <em>Ischemic cardiomyopathy</em> is a term frequently used to describe an enlarged heart caused by coronary artery disease, which is usually accompanied by heart failure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). In 2006, the American Heart Association proposed a set of Contemporary Classifications for cardiomyopathies, which continues to be in widespread use. Under this classification system, cardiomyopathies are divided into two major groups based on predominant organ involvement. These include <em>primary cardiomyopathies</em> (genetic, nongenetic, and acquired), which are focused primarily on the heart muscle, and <em>secondary cardiomyopathies,</em> which show myocardial involvement secondary to the influence of a vast list of disease processes that include, but are not limited to, amyloidosis, Fabry disease, sarcoidosis, and scleroderma (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1827">Maron, Towbin, Thiene, et&#x00A0;al., 2006</a>). This chapter focuses on the primary cardiomyopathies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s902">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathophysiology of all cardiomyopathies is a series of events that culminate in impaired cardiac output. Decreased <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page776" title="776"></span>stroke volume stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone response, resulting in increased systemic vascular resistance and increased sodium and fluid retention, which place an increased workload on the heart. Often, the decrease in cardiac output can be seen on echocardiogram as a decrease in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ejection fraction:&lt;/b&gt; percentage of the end-diastolic blood volume ejected from the ventricle with each heartbeat">ejection fraction</button></strong>, expressed as a percentage of the end-diastolic blood volume ejected from the ventricle with each heartbeat. These alterations can lead to heart failure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>

<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt">Sodium is the major electrolyte involved with cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy often leads to heart failure, which develops, in part, from fluid overload. Fluid overload is often associated with elevated sodium intake.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Dilated Cardiomyopathy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy, with a general prevalence of between 1 in 250 and 1 in 2500 (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1830">Merlo, Cannata, Gobbo, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). DCM is distinguished by significant dilation of the ventricles without simultaneous hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction (<a href="#ff24-8">Fig. 24-8</a>). The ventricles have elevated systolic and diastolic volumes but a decreased ejection fraction.</p>
<p class="indent">Microscopic examination of the muscle tissue shows diminished contractile elements (actin and myosin filaments) of the muscle fibers and diffuse necrosis of myocardial cells. The result is poor systolic function. The structural changes decrease the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle with systole, increasing the amount of blood remaining in the ventricle after contraction. Less blood is then able to enter the ventricle during diastole, increasing end-diastolic pressure and eventually increasing pulmonary and systemic venous pressures. Altered valve function, usually regurgitation, can result from an enlarged stretched ventricle. Poor blood flow through the ventricle may also cause ventricular or atrial thrombi, which may embolize to other locations in the body.</p>
<p class="indent">More than 75 conditions and diseases may cause DCM, including pregnancy, hypertension, heavy alcohol intake, viral infection (e.g., influenza), chemotherapeutic medications (e.g., daunorubicin, doxorubicin), thyrotoxicosis, myxedema, persistent tachycardia, and Chagas disease. When the causative factor cannot be identified, the diagnosis is idiopathic DCM which accounts for 20% to 30% of nonischemic DCM cases (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">McNally &#x0026; Mestroni, 2017</a>; <a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1830">Merlo et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Familial DCM accounts for approximately 30% to 50% of all DCM cases and approximately 40% of familial DCM cases have a definitive genetic etiology (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">McNally &#x0026; Mestroni, 2017</a>). An elucidation of family history by the nurse is therefore a very important component of the assessment process. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent or delay significant symptoms and sudden death from DCM.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The estimated prevalence of HCM is 0.16% to 0.29% of the adult population (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Marian &#x0026; Braunwald, 2017</a>). HCM is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to increased heart muscle size and mass, especially along the septum <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page777" title="777"></span>(see&#x00A0;<a href="#ff24-8">Fig. 24-8</a>) but can involve other areas of the heart. The phenotypic expression of the disease is age dependent. HCM is the leading cause of sudden death in adolescents and young adults, particularly in athletes (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Marian &#x0026; Braunwald, 2017</a>). 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations, and echocardiograms are used to screen for the disease.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff24-8">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff24-8.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff24-8.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;24-8 &#x2022;</span> Cardiomyopathies that lead to congestive heart failure. Adapted from Anatomical Chart Company. (2010). <em>Atlas of pathophysiology</em> (3rd ed.). Ambler, PA: Lippincott Williams &#x0026; Wilkins.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">Patients with a suspected diagnosis of HCM should undergo genetic testing; if negative, the diagnosis is not completely ruled out. If genetic testing is positive for known HCM genetic mutations, first-degree relatives should also be tested for the genetic mutation found in the patient. In patients that have positive genetic testing, but are asymptomatic for cardiomyopathy, annual screening with an ECG, physical examination and echocardiogram should be done, as the likelihood of clinical progression increases with increasing age. The phenotype typically manifests sometime between adolescence and the fifth decade of life (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Marian &#x0026; Braunwald, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiac muscle cells normally lie parallel to and end to end with each other. The hypertrophied cardiac muscle cells are disorganized, oblique, and perpendicular to each other, decreasing the effectiveness of contractions. In HCM, the coronary arteriole walls are thickened, which decrease the internal diameter of the arterioles. The narrow arterioles restrict the blood supply to the myocardium, causing numerous small areas of ischemia and necrosis. The necrotic areas of the myocardium ultimately fibrose and scar, further impeding ventricular contraction and possibly increasing the risk of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Increased thickness of the heart muscle reduces the size of the ventricular cavities and causes the ventricles to take a longer time to relax after systole. During the first part of diastole, it is more difficult for the ventricles to fill with blood. The atrial contraction at the end of diastole becomes critical for ventricular filling and systolic contraction.</p>
<p class="indent">HCM can lead to obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) if there is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve that abuts the mitral valve against the hypertrophied septum during systole (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Marian &#x0026; Braunwald, 2017</a>; <a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Nishimura, Seggewiss, &#x0026; Schaff, 2017</a>). LVOT obstruction is a dynamic process that is dependent on both the volume of blood in the left ventricle as well as the ability of the myocytes to contract. Approximately one third of patients with HCM have LVOT obstruction at rest that worsens with provocation, another one third do not have obstruction at rest, but can get obstruction with provocation (e.g., exercise or the Valsalva maneuver), and roughly one third of patients have no LVOT obstruction even with provocation (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Marian &#x0026; Braunwald, 2017</a>). Obstruction of the LVOT can lead to syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, dyspnea, and heart failure. The presence of a systolic ejection murmur can be indicative of LVOT, and echocardiography is then indicated to confirm its presence. Hydration, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and lifestyle modification can be used to minimize LVOT obstruction. In particular, patients should avoid activities that can cause rapid alterations to preload (e.g., hot tubs, saunas, prolonged hot showers) (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1835">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). However, patients that do not respond to medical therapy should be considered for surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation to decrease the size of the hypertrophied septum and thereby eliminate LVOT obstruction.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Restrictive Cardiomyopathy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">RCM is the least common type of cardiomyopathy (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Muchtar, Blauwet, &#x0026; Gertz, 2017</a>; <a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Pereira, Grogan, &#x0026; Dec, 2018</a>). RCM is characterized by diastolic dysfunction caused by rigid ventricular walls that impair diastolic filling and ventricular stretch (see <a href="#ff24-8">Fig. 24-8</a>). A rigid ventricle alters the curve in the Frank&#x2013;Starling law (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>) and leads to the rapid rise of filling pressures despite only small increases in blood volume. However, chamber size and systolic function are usually normal. Arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are common. Signs and symptoms are similar to constrictive pericarditis (see later discussion) and include dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and chest pain. Echocardiography may be useful in differentiating between these two conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, RCM is either due to an inherited or acquired disease that may be systemic. There are four general categories for the causes of RCM: infiltrative disease, storage disease, noninfiltrative, and endomyocardial.</p>
<p class="indent">An example of an infiltrative disease that may cause RCM is amyloidosis, in which amyloid, a misfolded protein, is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page778" title="778"></span>deposited between cardiomyocytes. An inherited storage disease that can lead to RCM is hemochromatosis, in which iron deposits in the heart lead to cardiac stiffness. Scleroderma is a noninfiltrative connective tissue disorder that can cause RCM. Certain cancer treatments, such as radiation and use of various chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., anthracyclines) can cause endomyocardial damage that leads to RCM (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1831">Muchtar et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Often, endomyocardial biopsy is needed to determine the etiology; treatment is then directed at the underlying cause.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">ARVC/D is an uncommon form of inherited heart muscle disease. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 5000 people in the general population (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1804">Bennett, Haqqani, Berruezo, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). ARVC/D occurs when the myocardium is progressively infiltrated and replaced by fibrous scar and adipose tissue. Infiltration of fibrous and adipose tissue leads to ventricle dilatation, poor contractility, and arrhythmias.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, only localized areas of the right ventricle are affected, but as the disease progresses, the entire heart is affected. Because of this typical pathologic progression, there is a move to change the name of this cardiomyopathy to a more general term of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) to recognize the left ventricular involvement (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1804">Bennett et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with ARVC/D, palpitations or syncope may develop between 15 and 40 years of age. Sudden cardiac death may also be the first presentation. Diagnosis is made based on the ECG, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, and family history. Since this is a genetic disorder, patients that are diagnosed are referred to a genetic counselor for testing. However, genetic testing can be negative in up to 50% of patients (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1804">Bennett et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If a genetic mutation is identified, first-degree relatives of the patient should undergo genetic testing. Patients affected by arrhythmias may benefit from having an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placed (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Unclassified Cardiomyopathies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Unclassified cardiomyopathies are different from or have characteristics of more than one of the previously described types and are caused by fibroelastosis, noncompacted myocardium, systolic dysfunction with minimal dilation, and mitochondrial diseases. Examples of unclassified cardiomyopathies can include left ventricular noncompaction and stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1810">Elliott et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s903">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with cardiomyopathy may remain stable and without symptoms for many years. As the disease progresses, so do the symptoms. Frequently, dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy is first diagnosed when the patient presents with signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., DOE, fatigue, PND, cough [especially with exertion or at night], orthopnea, peripheral edema, early satiety, nausea; see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). The patient also may experience chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, nausea, and syncope with exertion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s904">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Physical examination at early stages may reveal tachycardia and extra heart sounds (e.g., S<sub>3</sub>, S<sub>4</sub>). Patients with DCM may have diastolic murmurs, and patients with DCM and HCM may have systolic murmurs. With disease progression, examination also reveals signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., crackles on pulmonary auscultation, jugular vein distention, pitting edema of dependent body parts, hepatomegaly [i.e., enlarged liver]).</p>
<p class="indent">Diagnosis is usually made from findings disclosed by the patient history and by ruling out other causes of heart failure such as myocardial infarction. The echocardiogram is one of the most helpful diagnostic tools because the structure and function of the ventricles can be observed easily. Cardiac MRI may also be used, particularly to assist with the diagnosis of HCM and ARCV/D. ECG may demonstrate arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias) and changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy (left axis deviation, wide QRS, ST changes, inverted T waves). In ARVC/D, the ECG may show QRS widening, T-wave inversions in leads V<sub>1</sub>&#x2013;V<sub>4</sub>, and ventricular ectopy. Additionally, there is often a small epsilon wave at the end of the QRS (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1804">Bennett et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The chest x-ray reveals heart enlargement and possibly pulmonary congestion. Cardiac catheterization, coronary CT, or stress testing is often used to rule out coronary artery disease as a causative factor. Endomyocardial biopsy may be performed to analyze myocardial cells, particularly in RCM.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s905">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management is directed toward identifying and managing possible underlying or precipitating causes; correcting the heart failure with medications, a low sodium diet, and an exercise/rest regimen (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>); and controlling arrhythmias with antiarrhythmic medications and possibly with an implanted electronic device, such as an ICD (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>). If the patient has signs and symptoms of congestion, fluid intake may be limited to 2 L each day. However, patients with HCM should avoid dehydration and may need beta-blockers to maintain cardiac output and minimize the risk of LVOT obstruction during systole. Anticoagulants are no longer routinely prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">For some patients with DCM, biventricular pacing (also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy or CRT) increases the ejection fraction and reverses some of the structural changes in the myocardium (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As noted previously, some forms of cardiomyopathy are inherited/genetic. Any family history of cardiomyopathy should be noted when the nurse is taking a family health history. In appropriate cases, the patient should be referred to a genetic counselor for testing. If genetic mutations are found, it is recommended that first-degree relatives also be tested. Unfortunately, there are currently some problems with patients receiving insurance reimbursement for genetic testing in the United States.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s906">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When heart failure progresses and medical treatment is no longer effective, surgical intervention, including heart transplantation, is considered. However, because of the limited number of organ donors, many patients die waiting for transplantation. In some cases, a VAD is implanted to support the failing heart until a suitable donor heart becomes available (see later discussion).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 778</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page779" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="779">p. 779</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Surgery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When patients with HCM and LVOT obstruction become symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy or cannot tolerate medical therapy, surgery is considered. The most common procedure done is a myectomy (sometimes referred to as a myotomy&#x2013;myectomy or the Morrow procedure), in which some of the heart tissue is excised. Septal tissue approximately 1 cm wide and deep is cut from the enlarged septum below the aortic valve. The length of septum removed typically extends to the papillary muscles. Possible complications include complete heart block and subsequent pacemaker dependence, ventricular septal defects, or failure to adequately alleviate the obstruction. Surgical mortality rates are reportedly between less than 1% and as high as 16% (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1835">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Heart Transplantation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because of advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapies, heart transplantation is now a therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart disease. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are some of the more common immunosuppressants that decrease the body&#x2019;s rejection of foreign proteins, such as transplanted organs. Unfortunately, these drugs also decrease the body&#x2019;s ability to resist infections and increase the risk of various cancers, and a satisfactory balance must be achieved between suppressing rejection and avoiding infection. In 2017, there were 3273 heart transplants performed in the United States (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1841">Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, rejection of previously transplanted hearts, and congenital heart disease are the most common indications for transplantation. Typical candidates have severe symptoms uncontrolled by medical therapy, no other surgical options, and a prognosis of less than 1 to 2 years to live. A multidisciplinary team screens the candidate before recommending the transplantation procedure. The person&#x2019;s age, pulmonary status, other chronic health conditions, psychosocial status, family support, infections, history of other transplantations, adherence to therapeutic regimens, and current health status are considered. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a national organization that is regulated by the U.S. government, is charged with maintaining organ transplant waiting lists and allocating donor organs. When a donor heart becomes available, UNOS generates a list of potential recipients on the basis of ABO blood group compatibility, the body sizes of the donor and the potential recipient, age, severity of illness, length of time on the waiting list, and the geographic locations of the donor and potential recipient (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1837">Organ Procurement and Transplant Network [OPTN], 2019</a>). Some patients are candidates for more than one organ transplant (e.g., heart&#x2013;lung, heart&#x2013;kidney, heart&#x2013;liver).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orthotopic transplantation:&lt;/b&gt; the recipient&#x2019;s heart is removed and a donor heart is grafted into the same site">Orthotopic transplantation</button></strong> is the most common surgical procedure for cardiac transplantation. Some surgeons prefer to remove the recipient&#x2019;s heart but leave a portion of the recipient&#x2019;s atria (with the vena cava and pulmonary veins) in place, which is known as the biatrial technique. However, this technique has been modified to a more common approach called the <em>bicaval technique.</em> This technique includes removal of the recipient&#x2019;s heart, and the implantation of the donor heart with intact atria at the vena cava and pulmonary veins (<a href="#ff24-9">Fig. 24-9</a>) (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Kittleson, Patel, &#x0026; Kobashigawa, 2017</a>). This newer approach is associated with decreased AV valve regurgitation, arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Patients who have had heart transplantations are constantly balancing the risk of rejection with the risk of infection and diseases such as cancer. They must adhere to a complex regimen of diet, medications, activity, follow-up laboratory studies, biopsies of the transplanted heart (to diagnose rejection), and clinic visits. There are three classes of medications that are prescribed for a transplant patient to help minimize rejection: corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), and antiproliferative agents (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or sirolimus).</p>
<p class="indent">The transplanted heart has no nerve connections (i.e., denervated heart) to the recipient&#x2019;s body, so the sympathetic and vagus nerves do not affect the transplanted heart. The resting rate of the transplanted heart is approximately 90 to 110 bpm, but it increases gradually if catecholamines are in the circulation. Patients must gradually increase and decrease their exercise (i.e., extended warm-up and cool-down periods), because 20 to 30 minutes may be required to achieve the desired heart rate. Atropine does not increase the heart rate of transplanted hearts, and digoxin does not decrease the heart rate in atrial fibrillation. Additionally, many patients who have had heart transplantations do not experience angina with ischemia and may present with congestive heart failure, silent myocardial infarction, or sudden death without a prior history of coronary artery disease (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1795">Kittleson et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to rejection and infection, complications may include accelerated atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (i.e., cardiac allograft vasculopathy, accelerated graft atherosclerosis, transplant coronary artery disease). Both immunologic and nonimmunologic factors cause arterial injury and inflammation of the coronary arteries. The arterial smooth muscle proliferates, and there is hyperplasia of the coronary artery intima, accelerating atherosclerosis along the entire length of the coronary arteries (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1845">Stehlik, Kobashigawa, Hunt, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page780" title="780"></span> Hypertension may occur in patients taking cyclosporine or tacrolimus due to the effect these medications have on the kidneys. Osteoporosis is a frequent side effect of the antirejection medications as well as pretransplantation dietary insufficiency and medications. Patients with a long-term sedentary lifestyle are at greater risk for osteoporosis. Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease and cancer of the skin and lips are the most common malignancies after transplantation, possibly caused by immunosuppression. Weight gain, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemias (e.g., hypercholesterolemia), hypertension, and kidney failure, as well as central nervous system, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disturbances, may be adverse effects of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. Toxicity from immunosuppressant medications may occur as well. For patients receiving their transplanted hearts after the year 2000, the median survival is more than 12 years (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1845">Stehlik et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In the first year after transplantation, patients respond to the psychosocial stresses imposed by organ transplant in various ways. Most report a higher quality of life and can return to activities of daily living and to work with little to no functional limitations (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1845">Stehlik et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Some have significant feelings of indebtedness to the donor, or experience guilt that someone had to die for them to be able to live, which can negatively affect their adherence to the medical regimen (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1842">Shemesh, Peles-Bortz, Peled, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="#ct24-2">Chart 24-2</a> Nursing Research Profile: Factors Affecting Nonadherence After Heart Transplant).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mechanical Assist Devices and Total Artificial Hearts</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The use of cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiovascular surgery and the possibility of performing heart transplantation in patients with end-stage cardiac disease, as well as the desire for a treatment option for patients who are not transplant candidates, have increased the need for mechanical assist devices. Patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and patients in cardiogenic shock may benefit from a period of mechanical heart assistance. The most commonly used device is the intra-aortic balloon pump (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). This pump decreases the work of the heart during contraction but does not perform the actual work of the heart.</p>
<p class="h7">Ventricular Assist Devices</p>
<p class="nonindent">More complex devices that perform some or all of the pumping function for the heart are now being used. These more sophisticated <strong>ventricular assist devices</strong> can circulate as much blood per minute as the heart, if not more (<a href="#ff24-10">Fig. 24-10</a>). There are short- and long-term devices available, depending on the indication. Each VAD is used to support one ventricle, although in some instances, two VAD pumps may be used for biventricular support. Additionally, some VADs can be combined with an oxygenator; the combination is called <em>extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</em> The oxygenator&#x2013;VAD combination is used for the patient whose heart cannot pump adequate blood through the body or when the lungs fail to oxygenate the blood despite supplemental oxygen or ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">VADs may be external, internal (i.e., implanted) with an external power source, or completely internal, and they may generate a pulsatile or continuous blood flow. There are four types of VADs: pneumatic, electric or electromagnetic, axial flow, and centrifugal. Pneumatic VADs are external or implanted pulsatile devices with a flexible reservoir housed in a rigid exterior. The reservoir usually fills with blood drained from the atrium or ventricle. The device then forces pressurized air into the rigid housing, compressing the reservoir and returning the blood to the circulation, usually into the aorta. Electric or electromagnetic VADs are similar to pneumatic VADs, but instead of using pressurized air to return the blood to the circulation, one or more flat metal plates are pushed against the reservoir. Generally, pulsatile VADs have been replaced by the newer generation of axial and centrifugal pumps. The axial and centrifugal pumps have lower rates of pump thrombus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page781" title="781"></span>formation and are of smaller device sizes. Axial flow VADs use a rotary mechanism (an impeller) to create nonpulsatile blood flow. The impeller spins rapidly within the VAD, creating a vacuum that pulls blood into the VAD and then pushes the blood out into the systemic circulation&#x2014;the process is similar to a fan spinning in a tunnel, pulling air in one end of the tunnel and pushing it out the other. Centrifugal VADs are nonpulsatile devices that consist of a single moving impeller that is suspended in the pump housing by a combination of magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. The impeller rotates and pulls blood into the pump housing and ejects the blood out to the systemic circulation (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1795">Kittleson et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Shemesh, Y., Peles-Bortz, A., Peled, Y., et&#x00A0;al. (2017). Feelings of indebtedness and guilt toward donor and immunosuppressive medication adherence among heart transplant (HTx) patients, as assessed in a cross-sectional study with the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale (BAASIS). <em>Clinical Transplantation, 31</em>(10). doi:10.1111/ctr.13053</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to assess immunosuppression medication adherence among patients who had heart transplants and to test if adherence was affected by feelings of indebtedness and guilt toward the donor.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a descriptive correlational study with a cross-sectional design. It utilized a convenience sample consisting of 102 patients who had heart transplants and who engaged in outpatient follow up at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel. Participants were 76.5% male, 65.3% were born in Israel, and had a mean age of 56.66 y at the time of the study. The five-item BAASIS survey was used to assess adherence in the past 4 wks as it related to timing of medication intake, self-altering the prescribed dosage, and stopping or missing medication doses. Feelings of guilt and indebtedness were assessed with two survey questions via a Likert scale. Medical record review was also utilized. Data were evaluated using a variety of statistical analyses, which included <em>t</em>-tests, correlation analyses, and logistic regression analysis.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Sixty-four percent of participants reported nonadherence with immunosuppression within the previous 4 wks. Age, time since transplant, and feelings of guilt were statistically associated with variance in adherence. An increase in age was associated with an increase in adherence, whereas an increase in time since transplant and feelings of guilt were associated with an increase in nonadherence.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nonadherence to immunosuppression is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality among patients with heart transplants. Nurses should assess patients&#x2019; adherence to immunosuppression and be aware of the various factors that may influence adherence. Understanding what can contribute to nonadherence, such as feelings of guilt, enables the nurse to attempt to alleviate those feelings and thereby improve patient adherence and transplant outcomes.</p>

<p class="indent">VADs may be used as (1) a &#x201C;bridge to recovery&#x201D; for patients who require temporary assistance for reversible ventricular failure, (2) a &#x201C;bridge to transplant&#x201D; for patients with end-stage heart failure until a donor organ becomes available for transplant, and (3) &#x201C;destination therapy&#x201D; for patients with end-stage heart failure who are not candidates for or decline heart transplantation and have the VAD implanted for permanent use (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1795">Kittleson et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). As patients spend an increased length of time on the transplant list and more VADs are being implanted, destination therapy now accounts for 50% of patients on mechanical circulatory support (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Han, Acker, &#x0026; Atluri, 2018</a>). Thus, the volume of patients with VADs in the community is rapidly expanding and it is important that first responders and other providers are familiar with the basics of VAD management and equipment (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1808">Cook, Colvin, Francis, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). In some instances, the patient may request deactivation of the VAD, which may cause ethical controversy (<a href="#ct24-3">Chart 24-3</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Can an Adult with a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) Have the LVAD Deactivated?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You work on a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) and are assigned to care for J.J., a 75-year-old man with an extensive cardiac history who received a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) 10 mo ago. When the device was implanted, J.J. knew the treatment was a destination therapy (i.e., a final treatment option) since he was not a candidate for a heart transplant. The goal was to improve his quality of life. However, this is now his 12th hospitalization since the LVAD was activated, and J.J. now questions the purported benefit of the LVAD. During morning rounds with the cardiologist, J.J. tells you, the cardiologist, his wife, and adult daughter that he feels that the quality of his life is poor and not going to improve. He pointedly asks the cardiologist to deactivate the device, saying that he realizes this will lead to his death. J.J. is mentally competent (i.e., possesses the mental capacity to understand the ramifications of his request). J.J.&#x2019;s family, the cardiologist, and you are all stakeholders in this decision and each of you express reluctance at honoring his request.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Many ethical dilemmas are inherent in this scenario. Although the LVAD is internally implanted, the control switch to deactivate the device is external. Some bioethicists argue that since the device has an external component, deactivating the device is similar to withdrawing treatment, which is ethical. Others argue that it becomes an integrated body part once it is implanted; therefore, to remove it is consistent with euthanasia. There is an obligation to respect J.J.&#x2019;s autonomy and self-determination, especially since he has the capacity to make these decisions (i.e., he is mentally competent). Yet, there is a &#x201C;slippery slope&#x201D; at play here in terms of the principle of nonmaleficence.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chapter 1, Chart 1-7</a>). Which principle do you think should have preeminence as you work to resolve the conflicting emotions between J.J., his family, and the health care team?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What arguments would you offer <em>in favor of</em> removal of the LVAD?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What arguments would you offer <em>against</em> removal of the LVAD?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you believe deactivation of an LVAD is the same as withdrawal of other life-sustaining treatments (e.g., extubation)? Do you believe deactivation of an LVAD constitutes euthanasia?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assume that J.J. is determined competent to make this decision and the deactivation is scheduled. Discuss the implications of this procedure on the stakeholders including you, the cardiologist, and the patient&#x2019;s wife and daughter. Do you have the right to refuse to participate in the procedure? Identify what resources might be of help to you as you grapple with making the best decision for all stakeholders.</p>

<p class="h7">Total Artificial Hearts</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Total artificial hearts</strong> are designed to replace both ventricles. Only one TAH has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a bridge to transplant, the SynCardia TAH, and it requires the removal of the patient&#x2019;s heart for implant. Although there has been some short-term success, the long-term results have been disappointing. Researchers hope to develop a device that can be permanently implanted and will eliminate the need for donated human heart transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease. The CARMAT TAH is undergoing early clinical trials in Europe; it features biocompatible materials (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Ewald, Milano, &#x0026; Rogers, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications of VADs and TAHs include bleeding disorders, hemorrhage, thromboemboli, hemolysis, infection, kidney injury, right-sided heart failure, multisystem failure, and mechanical failure. Nursing care of patients with these mechanical assist devices focuses on assessment for and minimization of these complications as well as providing emotional support and education about the device and the underlying cardiac disease.</p>

<p class="processppara">Nursing assessment for the patient with cardiomyopathy begins with a detailed history of the presenting signs and symptoms. The nurse identifies possible etiologic factors, such as heavy alcohol intake, recent illness or pregnancy, family history of sudden death or history of the disease in immediate family members. If the patient reports chest pain, a thorough review of the pain, including its precipitating factors, is warranted. The review of systems includes the presence of orthopnea, PND, and syncope or dyspnea with exertion. The number of pillows needed to sleep, usual weight, any weight change, and limitations on activities of daily living are assessed. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Stages of Heart Failure classification is utilized to help identify disease progression, and the New York Heart Association Functional Classification for heart failure is determined based on the severity of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, Tables 25-1 and 25-2). The patient&#x2019;s usual diet is evaluated to determine the need to reduce sodium intake, optimize nutrition, or supplement with vitamins.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because of the chronicity of cardiomyopathy, the nurse conducts a careful psychosocial history, exploring the impact of the disease on the patient&#x2019;s role within the family and community. Identification of perceived stressors helps the patient and the health care team to implement activities that relieve anxiety associated with changes in health status. Very early on, the patient&#x2019;s support systems are identified, and members are encouraged to become involved in the patient&#x2019;s care and therapeutic regimen. The assessment addresses the effect the diagnosis has had on the patient and members of their support system and the patient&#x2019;s emotional status. Findings from a recent meta-analysis suggest that 19% of patients with heart failure meet criteria for depressive disorders and 21.5% have significant symptoms of depression (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1806">Celano, Villegas, Albanese, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Various screening tools are available to assess symptoms associated with heart failure, including depression, though no one screening tool has emerged as the generally accepted standard.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for patients include improvement or maintenance of cardiac output, increased activity tolerance, reduction of anxiety, effective management of the self-care program, increased sense of power with decision making, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page783" title="783"></span><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> C<span class="small">ARDIAC</span> O<span class="small">UTPUT AND</span> P<span class="small">ERIPHERAL</span> B<span class="small">LOOD</span> F<span class="small">LOW</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">During a symptomatic episode, rest is indicated. Many patients with DCM find that sitting up with their legs down is more comfortable than lying down in a bed. This position is helpful in pooling venous blood in the periphery and reducing preload. Assessing the patient&#x2019;s oxygen saturation at rest and during activity may assist with determining a need for supplemental oxygen. Oxygen usually is given through a nasal cannula when indicated.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Ensuring that medications are taken as prescribed is important to preserving adequate cardiac output. The nurse may assist the patient with planning a schedule for taking medications and identifying methods to remember to follow it, such as associating the time to take a medication with an activity (e.g., eating a meal, brushing teeth) or obtaining a pillbox.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">It is also important to ensure that the patient receives or chooses food selections that are appropriate for a low sodium diet. One way to monitor a patient&#x2019;s response to treatment is to determine the patient&#x2019;s weight every day and identify any significant change. Another indication of the effect of treatment involves assessment of shortness of breath after activity and comparison to before treatment, as well as a change in the number of pillows needed to comfortably sleep. Patients with low cardiac output may need assistance keeping warm and frequently changing position to stimulate circulation and reduce the possibility of skin breakdown.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">NCREASING</span> A<span class="small">CTIVITY</span> T<span class="small">OLERANCE AND</span> I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> G<span class="small">AS</span> E<span class="small">XCHANGE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse plans the patient&#x2019;s activities so that they occur in cycles, alternating rest with activity periods. This benefits the patient&#x2019;s physiologic status, and it helps educate the patient about the need for planned cycles of rest and activity. For example, after taking a bath or shower, the patient should plan to sit and read a newspaper or engage in other relaxing activities. Suggesting that the patient sit while chopping vegetables, drying their hair, or shaving helps the patient learn to balance rest with activity. The nurse also makes sure that the patient recognizes the symptoms indicating the need for rest and actions to take when the symptoms occur. Patients with HCM, ARVC/D, or RCM must avoid strenuous activity, isometric exercises, and competitive sports.</p>

<p class="processppara">Spiritual, psychological, and emotional support may be indicated for patients, families, and significant others. Interventions are directed toward eradicating or alleviating perceived stressors. Patients receive appropriate information about cardiomyopathy and self-management activities. It is important to provide an atmosphere in which patients feel free to verbalize concerns and receive assurance that their concerns are legitimate. If the patient is awaiting transplantation or facing death, it is necessary to allow time to discuss these issues. Providing the patient with realistic hope helps reduce anxiety while they await a donor heart. The nurse helps the patient, family, and significant others with anticipatory grieving.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients often go through a grieving process when cardiomyopathy is diagnosed. The patient is assisted in identifying the things in life that they have lost (e.g., foods that the patient enjoyed eating but are high in sodium, the ability to engage in an active lifestyle, the ability to play sports, the ability to lift grandchildren) and their emotional responses to the loss (e.g., anger, feelings of sadness). The nurse assists the patient in identifying the amount of control that they still have over life, such as making food choices, managing medications, and working with the patient&#x2019;s primary provider to achieve the best possible outcomes. A diary in which the patient records food selections and weight may help with understanding the relationship between sodium intake and weight gain and give patients a sense of control over their disease. Some patients can manage a self-titrating diuretic regimen in which they adjust the dose of diuretic to their symptoms.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="yellon">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> A key part of the plan of nursing care involves educating patients about the medication regimen, symptom monitoring, and symptom management (<a href="#ct24-4">Chart 24-4</a>). The nurse plays an integral role as the patient learns to balance lifestyle and work while accomplishing therapeutic activities. Helping patients cope with their disease status helps them adjust their lifestyles and implement a self-care program at home. Attainment of a goal, no matter how small, also promotes the patient&#x2019;s sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4n"><span class="yellon">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The nurse reinforces previous education and performs ongoing assessment of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms and progress. The nurse also assists the patient and family to adjust to lifestyle changes. Patients are taught to read nutrition labels, to maintain a record of daily weights and symptoms, and to organize daily activities to increase activity tolerance. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s response to recommendations about diet and fluid intake and to the medication regimen and stresses the signs and symptoms that should be reported to the primary provider. Because of the risk of arrhythmia, it may be necessary to educate the patient&#x2019;s family about cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). Women are often advised to avoid pregnancy, but each case is assessed individually. The nurse assesses the psychosocial needs of the patient and family on an ongoing basis. There may be concerns and fears about the prognosis, changes in lifestyle, effects of medications, and the possibility of others in the family having the same condition; these concerns often increase the patient&#x2019;s anxiety and interfere with effective coping strategies. Establishing trust is vital to the nurse&#x2019;s relationship with patients who are chronically ill and with these patients&#x2019; families. This is particularly significant when the nurse is involved with a patient and family in discussions about end-of-life decisions. Patients who have significant symptoms of heart failure or other complications of cardiomyopathy may benefit from transitional or home care.</p>
