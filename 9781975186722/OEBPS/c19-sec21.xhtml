<h4 class="h4" id="s706">Lung Cancer (Bronchogenic Carcinoma)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer among men and women in the United States, with about 1 out of 4 cancer deaths from lung cancer; over 135,000 deaths were estimated in 2018 (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Midthun, 2019</a>). Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. Approximately 228,820 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed annually; 13% of new cancers for men and women involve the lung or bronchus (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1453">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2019</a>). In approximately 48.5% of patients with lung cancer, the disease has spread to regional lymphatics and other sites by the time of diagnosis. As a result, the long-term survival rate is low. Overall, the 5-year survival rate is 21.7% (ALA, 2020; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Thomas &#x0026; Gould, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s707">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common cause of lung cancer is inhaled carcinogens, most often cigarette smoke (&#x003E;85%); other carcinogens include radon gas and occupational and environmental agents (ALA, 2020). Lung cancers arise from a single transformed epithelial cell in the tracheobronchial airways, in which the carcinogen binds to and damages the cell&#x2019;s DNA. This damage results in cellular changes, abnormal cell growth, and eventually a malignant cell. As the damaged DNA is passed on to daughter cells, the DNA undergoes further changes and becomes unstable. With the accumulation of genetic changes, the pulmonary epithelium undergoes malignant transformation from normal epithelium eventually to invasive carcinoma. Carcinoma tends to arise at sites of previous scarring in the lung (e.g., TB, fibrosis).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s708">Classification and Staging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For purposes of staging and treatment, over 95% of lung cancers are classified into one of two major categories: small <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page578" title="578"></span>cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC represents approximately 13% of tumors, and includes small cell and combined small cell cancers. NSCLC represents approximately 84% of tumors, and these are further classified by cell type, including squamous cell (20%), large cell (5%), adenocarcinoma (41%), and others, some of which cannot be classified (18%) (ACS, 2019; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Midthun, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="tablesource"><sup><em>a</em></sup>Data are for patients diagnosed between the years 2009 and 2015. The SEER database does not group patients by the TNM system; rather, SEER categorizes patients based upon whether or not cancer has spread to distant organs/tissues (<em>distant</em>), or to proximal tissues or lymph nodes (<em>regional)</em>, or has not spread outside the lung (<em>localized</em>).</p>
<p class="TABLEpLEGEND">NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; SCLC, small cell lung cancer; TNM system, a tumor staging system promulgated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer that stages cancer based upon evidence of the size of the tumor (<em>T</em>), extent of lymph node involvement (<em>N</em>), and whether or not metastasis has occurred (<em>M</em>).</p>
<p class="tablesource">Adapted from American Cancer Society (ACS). (2019). Lung cancer survival rates. Last updated 10/1/2019. Retrieved on 10/4/2019 at: <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html">www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html</a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In terms of specific types of NSCLC, squamous cell cancer is usually more centrally located and arises more commonly in the segmental and subsegmental bronchi. Adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent carcinoma of the lung in both men and women; it occurs peripherally as peripheral masses or nodules and often metastasizes. Large cell carcinoma (also called <em>undifferentiated carcinoma</em>) is a fast-growing tumor that tends to arise peripherally. Bronchoalveolar cell cancer is found in the terminal bronchi and alveoli and is usually slower growing compared with other bronchogenic carcinomas.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to classification according to cell type, lung cancers are staged using the TNM staging system. The stage of the tumor refers to the size of the tumor, its location, whether lymph nodes are involved, and whether the cancer has spread (ACS, 2019). NSCLC is staged as I to IV. Stage I is the earliest stage and has the highest cure rate, whereas stage IV designates metastatic spread. Survival rates for NSCLC are shown in <a href="#tt19-7">Table&#x00A0;19-7</a>. (Diagnostic tools and further information on staging are described in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s709">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN; 2020) asserts that 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases are caused by cigarette smoke, whether it is from voluntary or involuntary (secondhand) smoking. Other factors that have been associated with lung cancer include genetic predisposition, dietary deficits, and underlying respiratory diseases, such as COPD and TB. Some familial predisposition to lung cancer exists. The incidence of lung cancer in close relatives of patients with lung cancer is two to three times higher than the general population, regardless of smoking status (ACS, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tobacco Smoke</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times higher in men who smoke and 13 times higher in women who smoke compared to individuals who have never smoked (ACS, 2019). Risk is determined by the pack-year history (number of packs of cigarettes used each day, multiplied by the number of years smoked), the age of initiation of smoking, the depth of inhalation, and the tar and nicotine levels in the cigarettes smoked. The younger a person is when they start smoking, the greater the risk of developing lung cancer. People who smoke and use smokeless products as a supplemental source of nicotine have an increased overall risk of lung cancer (ACS, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Almost all cases of SCLC are due to cigarette smoking. SCLC is rare in people who have never smoked. It is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, grows quickly, and usually starts in the airways in the center of the chest (ACS, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) include e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookahs, and e-cigars. According to a 2018 survey of 44,000 high school adolescents, 37% of 12th graders self-reported use of e-cigarettes (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1525">NIH News in Health, 2019</a>). The amounts of nicotine and other substances a person gets from each cartridge are also unclear and have been found to vary greatly even when comparing same brand cartridges from the same manufacturer. Since these ENDS products have only been available for about a decade, the link between their use and lung cancer is unclear at the present time (ACS, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Secondhand Smoke</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Secondhand or involuntary smoking has been identified as a cause of lung cancer in people who do not smoke. People who are involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke in a closed environment (house, automobile, building) have an increased risk of lung cancer when compared with unexposed individuals who do not smoke (CDC, 2018a; NCCN, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Environmental and Occupational Exposure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Various carcinogens have been identified in the atmosphere, including motor vehicle emissions and pollutants from refineries and manufacturing plants. Evidence suggests that the incidence of lung cancer is greater in urban areas as a result of the buildup of pollutants and motor vehicle emissions (ALA, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Radon is a colorless, odorless gas found in soil and rocks. For many years, it has been associated with uranium mines, but it is now known to seep into homes through ground rock. High levels of radon have been associated with the development of lung cancer, especially when combined with cigarette smoking. Homeowners are advised to have radon levels checked in their houses and to arrange for special venting if the levels are high.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic exposure to industrial carcinogens, such as arsenic, asbestos, mustard gas, chromates, coke oven fumes, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page579" title="579"></span>nickel, oil, and radiation, has been associated with the development of lung cancer. Laws have been passed to control exposure to these carcinogens in the workplace.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genetic Mutations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic mutations can cause certain changes in the DNA of lung cells. These changes can lead to abnormal cell growth and, sometimes, cancer. Acquired mutations in lung cells often result from exposure to factors in the environment, such as cancer-causing chemicals in tobacco smoke (ACS, 2019). The most common genetic mutations occur in <em>EGFR</em> (the gene that produces epidermal growth factor receptor) and the <em>K-RAS</em> or <em>ALK</em> oncogenes. <em>EGFR</em> is abnormal in about 50% of all patients with lung cancer. Abnormalities in <em>K-RAS</em> or <em>ALK</em> oncogenes are thought to be important in the development of NSCLC (ACS, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s710">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Often, lung cancer develops insidiously and is asymptomatic until late in its course. The signs and symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor, the degree of obstruction, and the existence of metastases to regional or distant sites.</p>
<p class="indent">The most frequent symptom of lung cancer is cough or change in a chronic cough. People frequently ignore this symptom and attribute it to smoking or a respiratory infection. The cough may start as a dry, persistent cough, without sputum production. When obstruction of airways occurs, the cough may become productive due to infection.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>A cough that changes in character should arouse suspicion of lung cancer.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Dyspnea is prominent in patients early in their disease. Causes of dyspnea may include tumor occlusion of the airway or lung parenchyma, pleural effusion, pneumonia, or complications of treatment. Hemoptysis or blood-tinged sputum may be expectorated. Chest or shoulder pain may indicate chest wall or pleural involvement by a tumor. Pain also is a late manifestation and may be related to metastasis to the bone.</p>
<p class="indent">In some patients, a recurring fever is an early symptom in response to a persistent infection in an area of pneumonitis distal to the tumor. In fact, cancer of the lung should be suspected in people with repeated unresolved upper respiratory tract infections. If the tumor spreads to adjacent structures and regional lymph nodes, the patient may present with chest pain and tightness, hoarseness (involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia, head and neck edema, and symptoms of pleural or pericardial effusion. The most common sites of metastases are lymph nodes, bone, brain, contralateral lung, adrenal glands, and liver (see <a href="#ff19-10">Fig.&#x00A0;19-10</a>). Nonspecific symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and weight loss also may be present (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Eldridge, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s711">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If pulmonary symptoms occur in individuals who currently smoke or who formerly smoked, or in people chronically exposed to secondhand smoke, cancer of the lung should be considered. A chest x-ray is performed to search for pulmonary density, a solitary pulmonary nodule (coin lesion), atelectasis, and infection. CT scans of the chest are used to identify small nodules not easily visualized on the chest x-ray and also to serially examine areas for lymphadenopathy. Additionally, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual lung cancer screening using low dose CT (LDCT) for adults 55 to 80 years of age who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and either currently smoke or have quit smoking less than 15 years ago. Each pack-year is calculated based upon smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 1 year; for instance, a 30 pack-year is defined as smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years, or 3 packs daily for 10 years (CDC, 2019e).</p>

<p class="indent">Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is commonly used to diagnose lung cancer; it provides a detailed study of the tracheobronchial tree and allows for brushings, washings, and biopsies of suspicious areas. For peripheral lesions not amenable to bronchoscopic biopsy, a transthoracic fine-needle aspiration may be performed under CT guidance to aspirate cells from a suspicious area.</p>
<p class="indent">A variety of scans may be used to assess for metastasis of the cancer. These may include bone scans, abdominal scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and liver ultrasound. CT scan of the brain, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other neurologic diagnostic procedures are used to detect central nervous system metastases. Mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy may be used to obtain biopsy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page580" title="580"></span>samples from lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Endobronchial ultrasound biopsy of mediastinal nodes is also used. In some circumstances, an endoscopy with esophageal ultrasound may be used to obtain a transesophageal biopsy of enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes.</p>
<p class="indent">If surgery is a potential treatment, the patient is evaluated to determine whether the tumor is resectable and whether the patient can tolerate the physiologic impairment resulting from such surgery. Preoperative diagnostic studies provide a baseline for comparison during the postoperative period and detect additional abnormalities. Studies can be comprehensive and may include a bronchoscopic examination (a lighted scope is inserted into the airways to examine the bronchi), chest x-ray, MRI, ECG (for arteriosclerotic heart disease, conduction defects), nutritional assessment, determination of BUN and serum creatinine levels (to assess renal function), determination of glucose tolerance or blood glucose level (to check for diabetes), serum electrolytes and protein levels, blood volume determinations, complete blood cell count (CBC), pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, V./Q. scans, and exercise testing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s712">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objective of management is to provide a cure, if possible. Treatment depends on the cell type, the stage of the disease, and the patient&#x2019;s physiologic status (particularly cardiac and pulmonary status). In general, treatment for patients with NSCLC may involve surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy&#x2014;or a combination of these. Immunotherapy specifically targets patients&#x2019; immune cells so that they are primed to more effectively kill cancer cells. Gene therapy using agents that target specific genetic mutations including <em>EGFR</em> mutations and <em>ALK</em> and <em>ROS1</em> rearrangements have shown promising results (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Eldridge, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment for patients with SCLC may include surgery (but only if the cancer is in one lung and there is no metastasis), radiation therapy, laser therapy to open airways blocked by tumor growth, and endoscopic stent placement (to open an airway). Although the cancer cells are small, they grow very quickly and create large tumors. These tumors often metastasize (spread) rapidly to other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and bone. Typically, by the time a patient is diagnosed with SCLC, it is late in the course of the disease and metastasis has occurred.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s713">Surgical Management: Thoracotomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thoracotomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical opening into the chest cavity">thoracotomy</button></strong> (creation of a surgical opening into the thoracic cavity) may be performed to treat lung cancer. As noted previously, surgery is primarily used for patients with NSCLC, because SCLC grows rapidly and metastasizes early and extensively. Surgical resection is the preferred method of treating patients with localized NSCLCs without evidence of metastatic spread, and with adequate cardiopulmonary function. However, coronary artery disease, pulmonary insufficiency, and other comorbidities may contraindicate surgical intervention. The cure rate of surgical resection depends on the type and stage of the cancer. Several different types of lung resection may be performed (see <a href="#ct19-22">Chart&#x00A0;19-22</a>). The most common surgical procedure for a small, apparently curable tumor of the lung is lobectomy (removal of a lobe of the lung). In some cases, pneumonectomy (removal of an entire lung) may be required.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s714">Nursing Management of the Patient Having a Thoracotomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are typically admitted on the day of surgery. The nurse in the outpatient surgical clinic setting is responsible for performing the preoperative assessment and education and for alleviating the anxiety experienced by the patient and family members by providing them with anticipatory guidance. Postoperatively, the patient may be managed by the nurse in the ICU. Successfully managing transitions in care for the patient from the ICU to other inpatient acute care settings (e.g., medical-surgical unit, step-down unit) to the outpatient setting is a key nursing responsibility.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating the Patient Preoperatively</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse informs the patient about what to expect, from administration of anesthesia to thoracotomy, and the likely use of chest tubes and a drainage system in the postoperative period. The patient is also informed about the usual postoperative administration of oxygen to facilitate breathing and the possible use of a ventilator. It is essential to explain the importance of frequent turning to promote drainage of lung secretions. Instruction in the use of incentive spirometry begins before surgery to familiarize the patient with its correct use. The nurse educates the patient on the use of diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing, and the patient should begin practicing these techniques (see <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#ct20-5">Chart&#x00A0;20-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because a coughing schedule is necessary in the postoperative period to promote the clearance or removal of secretions, the nurse instructs the patient in the technique of coughing and warns the patient that the coughing routine may be uncomfortable. The nurse educates the patient about how to splint the incision with the hands, a pillow, or a folded towel.</p>
<p class="indent">Encouraging the use of forced expiratory technique (FET) may be helpful for the patient with diminished expiratory flow rates or for the patient who refuses to cough because of severe pain. FET is the expulsion of air through an open glottis. This technique stimulates pulmonary expansion and assists in alveolar inflation (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1443">Kacmarek, Stoller, Heuer, et al., 2017</a>). The nurse instructs the patient as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Take a deep diaphragmatic breath and exhale forcefully against the hand in a quick, distinct pant, or huff.</span></li>
<li><span>Practice doing small huffs and progress to one strong huff during exhalation.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patients should be informed preoperatively that blood and other fluids may be given, oxygen will be given, and vital signs will be checked often for several hours after surgery. If a chest tube is indicated (see later discussion on Chest Drainage Systems), the patient should be informed that it will drain the fluid and air that normally accumulate after chest surgery. The patient and family are informed that the patient may be admitted to the ICU for 1 to 2 days after surgery, that the patient may experience pain at the incision site, and that medication is available to relieve pain and discomfort.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Thoracic Surgeries and Procedures</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Pneumonectomy</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The removal of an entire lung, referred to as pneumonectomy, is performed chiefly for cancer when the lesion cannot be removed by a less extensive procedure. It also may be performed for lung abscesses, bronchiectasis, or extensive unilateral tuberculosis. The removal of the right lung is riskier than the removal of the left, because the right lung has a larger vascular bed and its removal imposes a greater physiologic burden.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">A posterolateral or anterolateral thoracotomy incision is made, sometimes with resection of a rib. The pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins are ligated and severed. The main bronchus is divided and the lung removed. The bronchial stump is stapled, and usually no drains are used because the accumulation of fluid in the empty hemithorax prevents mediastinal shift.</p>
<div class="figure">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/581-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-581-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Lobectomy</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">When the pathology is limited to one area of a lung, a lobectomy (removal of a lobe of a lung) is performed. Lobectomy, which is more common than pneumonectomy, may be carried out for bronchogenic carcinoma, giant emphysematous blebs or bullae, benign tumors, metastatic malignant tumors, bronchiectasis, and fungal infections.</p>
<div class="figure">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/581-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-581-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The surgeon makes a thoracotomy incision. Its exact location depends on the lobe to be resected. When the pleural space is entered, the involved lung collapses and the lobar vessels and the bronchus are ligated and divided. After the lobe is removed, the remaining lobes of the lung are re-expanded. Usually, two chest catheters are inserted for drainage. The upper tube is for air removal; the lower one is for fluid drainage. Sometimes, only one catheter is needed. The chest tube is connected to a chest drainage apparatus for several days.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Segmentectomy (Segmental Resection)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Some lesions are located in only one segment of the lung. Bronchopulmonary segments are subdivisions of the lung that function as individual units. They are held together by delicate connective tissue. Disease processes may be limited to a single segment. Care is used to preserve as much healthy and functional lung tissue as possible, especially in patients who already have limited cardiopulmonary reserve. Single segments can be removed from any lobe; the right middle lobe, which has only two small segments, invariably is removed entirely. On the left side, corresponding to a middle lobe, is a &#x201C;lingular&#x201D; segment of the upper lobe. This can be removed as a single segment or by lingulectomy. This segment frequently is involved in bronchiectasis.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Wedge Resection</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A wedge resection of a small, well-circumscribed lesion may be performed without regard to the location of the intersegmental planes. The pleural cavity usually is drained because of the possibility of an air or blood leak. This procedure is performed for diagnostic lung biopsy and for the excision of small peripheral nodules.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Bronchoplastic or Sleeve Resection</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Bronchoplastic resection is a procedure in which only one lobar bronchus, together with a part of the right or left bronchus, is excised. The distal bronchus is reanastomosed to the proximal bronchus or trachea.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Lung Volume Reduction</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Lung volume reduction is a surgical procedure involving the removal of 20% to 30% of a patient&#x2019;s lung through a midsternal incision or video thoracoscopy. The diseased lung tissue is identified on a lung perfusion scan. This surgery leads to significant improvements in dyspnea, exercise capacity, quality of life, and survival of a subgroup of people with end-stage emphysema.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Video Thoracoscopy</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A video thoracoscopy is an endoscopic procedure that allows the surgeon to look into the thorax without making a large incision. The procedure is performed to obtain specimens of tissue for biopsy, to treat recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and to diagnose either pleural effusions or pleural masses. Thoracoscopy has also been found to be an effective diagnostic and therapeutic alternative for the treatment of mediastinal disorders. Some advantages of video thoracoscopy are rapid diagnosis and treatment of some conditions, a decrease in postoperative complications, and a shortened hospital stay.</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse listens to the patient and family to evaluate their feelings about the illness and proposed treatment. The nurse also determines the patient&#x2019;s motivation to return to normal or baseline function. The patient may reveal significant concerns: fear of hemorrhage because of bloody sputum, fear of discomfort from a chronic cough and chest pain, fear of ventilator dependence, or fear of death because of dyspnea and the underlying disease.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse helps the patient to address fears and to cope with the stress of surgery by correcting any misconceptions, supporting the patient&#x2019;s decision to undergo surgery, and dealing honestly with questions about pain and discomfort and the patient&#x2019;s treatment. The management and control of pain begin before surgery, when the nurse informs the patient that many postoperative problems can be overcome by following certain routines related to deep breathing, coughing, turning, and moving. Nonopioid preemptive analgesic agents (e.g., acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) may also be prescribed to help decrease the dose of postoperative opioid agents. This also helps to facilitate deep-breathing techniques and return to normal respiratory function. If patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is to be used after surgery, the nurse instructs the patient in its use.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Postoperative Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After surgery, the vital signs are checked frequently. Oxygen is given by a mechanical ventilator, nasal cannula, or mask for as long as necessary. A reduction in lung capacity requires a period of physiologic adjustment, and fluids may be given at a low hourly rate to prevent fluid overload and pulmonary edema. After the patient has recovered from anesthesia and the vital signs have stabilized, the head of the bed may be elevated 30 to 45 degrees. Careful positioning of the patient is important. After pneumonectomy, a patient is usually turned every hour from the back to the operative side and should not be completely turned to the unoperated side. This allows the fluid left in the space to consolidate and prevents the remaining lung and the heart from shifting (mediastinal shift) toward the operative side. The patient with a lobectomy may be turned to either side, and a patient with a segmental resection usually is not turned onto the operative side unless the surgeon prescribes this position (see <a href="#ct19-23">Chart&#x00A0;19-23</a>: Plan of Nursing Care: Care of the Patient After Thoracotomy).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications after thoracic surgery are always possible and must be identified and managed early. The nurse monitors the patient at regular intervals for signs of respiratory distress or developing respiratory failure, arrhythmias, bronchopleural fistula, hemorrhage and shock, atelectasis, and incisional or pulmonary infection. Arrhythmias are often related to the effects of hypoxia or the surgical procedure. They are treated with antiarrhythmic medication and supportive therapy (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>). Pulmonary infections or effusion, often preceded by atelectasis, may occur a few days into the postoperative course.</p>
<p class="indent">Pneumothorax may occur after thoracic surgery if there is an air leak from the surgical site to the pleural cavity or from the pleural cavity to the environment. Failure of the chest drainage system prevents return of negative pressure in the pleural cavity and results in pneumothorax. In the patient who is postoperative, pneumothorax is often accompanied by hemothorax. The nurse maintains the chest drainage system and monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of pneumothorax (see later discussions): increasing shortness of breath, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and increasing respiratory distress. Bronchopleural fistula is a serious but rare complication that prevents the return of negative intrathoracic pressure and lung re-expansion. Depending on its severity, it is treated with continued closed chest drainage and mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemorrhage and shock are managed by treating the underlying cause, whether by reoperation or by administration of blood products or fluids. Pulmonary edema from overinfusion of IV fluids is a significant danger. Early symptoms are dyspnea; crackles; tachycardia; and pink, frothy sputum. This constitutes an emergency and must be reported and treated immediately (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Medication for pain is needed for several days after surgery; it is usually a combination of epidural analgesia, PCA, and scheduled or as-needed oral analgesics. Because coughing can be painful, the patient should be encouraged to splint the chest as taught in the preoperative period. Exercises are resumed early in the postoperative period to facilitate lung ventilation. The nurse assesses for signs of complications, including cyanosis, dyspnea, and acute chest pain. These may indicate atelectasis and should be reported immediately. Increased temperature or white blood cell count may indicate an infection, and pallor and increased pulse may indicate internal hemorrhage. Dressings are assessed for fresh bleeding.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient and family about postoperative care that will be continued in the community setting and at home.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse explains signs and symptoms that should be reported to the primary provider. These include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Change in respiratory status, such as increasing shortness of breath, fever, increased restlessness or other changes in mental or cognitive status, increased respiratory rate, change in respiratory pattern, change in amount or color of sputum</span></li>
<li><span>Bleeding or other drainage from the surgical incision or chest tube exit sites</span></li>
<li><span>Increased chest pain</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">In addition, respiratory care and other treatment modalities (oxygen; incentive spirometry; CPT; and oral, inhaled, or IV medications) may be continued at home. Therefore, the nurse needs to instruct the patient and family in their correct and safe use.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse emphasizes the importance of progressively increased activity. The patient is instructed to ambulate within limits and informed that return of strength is likely to be very gradual. Another important aspect of patient education addresses shoulder exercises. The patient is instructed to do these exercises five times daily (see <a href="#ct19-24">Chart&#x00A0;19-24</a>). Additional patient education is described in <a href="#ct19-25">Chart&#x00A0;19-25</a>.</p>

<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Depending on the patient&#x2019;s physical status and the availability of family assistance, a referral for home, community-based, or transitional care may be indicated. The home health nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s recovery from surgery, with special attention to respiratory status, the surgical incision, chest drainage, pain control, ambulation, and nutritional status. The patient&#x2019;s use of respiratory modalities is assessed to ensure that they are being used correctly and safely. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the postoperative treatment plan and identifies acute or late postoperative complications.</p>
<p class="indent">The recovery process may take longer than the patient had expected, and providing support to the patient is an important task for the nurse. Because of shorter hospital stays, follow-up appointments with the primary provider are essential. The nurse educates the patient about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments and completing laboratory tests as prescribed to assist the primary provider in evaluating recovery. The nurse provides continuous encouragement and education to the patient and family during the process. As recovery progresses, the patient and family are reminded about the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screening.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s715">Radiation Therapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Radiation therapy may offer cure in a small percentage of patients with lung cancer. It is useful in controlling neoplasms that cannot be surgically resected but are responsive to radiation. Irradiation also may be used to reduce the size of a tumor, to make an inoperable tumor operable, or to relieve the pressure of the tumor on vital structures. It can reduce symptoms of spinal cord metastasis and superior vena caval compression. In addition, prophylactic brain irradiation is used in certain patients to treat microscopic metastases to the brain. Radiation therapy may help relieve cough, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and bone and liver pain. Relief of symptoms may last from a few weeks to many months and is important in improving the quality of the remaining period of life. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a treatment option that delivers higher-than-typical doses of radiation directly to the tumor. This treatment is given over 1 to 5 days <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page586" title="586"></span>and is indicated for early stages of lung cancers in patients who either elect to not have surgery or are considered ineligible for surgery (ACS, 2019).</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Performing Arm and Shoulder Exercises</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Arm and shoulder exercises are performed after thoracic surgery to restore movement, prevent painful stiffening of the shoulder, and improve muscle power. The nurse instructs the patient to perform these exercises as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/586-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-586-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a></figcaption></figure></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Radiation therapy usually is toxic to normal tissue within the radiation field, and this may lead to complications such as esophagitis, pneumonitis, and radiation lung fibrosis, although the incidence of these complications has decreased over time with improvements in delivery of radiation therapy (ACS, 2019). These complications may impair ventilatory and diffusion capacity and significantly reduce pulmonary reserve. The patient&#x2019;s nutritional status, psychological outlook, fatigue level, and signs of anemia and infection are monitored throughout the treatment (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for management of the patient receiving radiation therapy).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s716">Chemotherapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chemotherapy is used to alter tumor growth patterns, to treat distant metastases or small cell cancer of the lung, and as an adjunct to surgery or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may provide relief, especially of pain, but it does not usually cure the disease or prolong life to any great degree. Chemotherapy is also accompanied by side effects. It is valuable in reducing pressure symptoms of lung cancer and in treating brain, spinal cord, and pericardial metastasis (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for a discussion of chemotherapy for the patient with cancer).</p>
<p class="indent">The choice of agent depends on the growth of the tumor cell and the specific phase of the cell cycle that the medication affects. In combination with surgery, chemotherapy may be given before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) or after surgery (adjuvant therapy). Specific guidelines are available for the treatment of differing stages of NSCLC and SCLC through the NCCN (2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s717">Immunotherapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Advances in immunotherapy have provided additional options for the treatment of advanced NSCLC and SCLC. Immunotherapy drugs referred to as checkpoint inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of unresectable stage III tumors in addition to lung cancers that have metastasized. These agents target programmed cell death proteins such as PD-1 or PD-L1 on T cells that prevent T cells from attacking other cells in the body. By blocking these PD proteins, the T cells are able to mount a better immune response against the tumor cells, more quickly and effectively killing them. Four checkpoint inhibitors are FDA-approved for use with lung cancer. The first three, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, are approved for use in metastatic lung cancer (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Hellman &#x0026; West, 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Yang, Zhang, &#x0026; Wang, 2019</a>). In addition, penbrolizumab combined with chemotherapy may be used as a first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Durvalumab is the only agent approved for nonoperable stage III NSCLC (Hellmann &#x0026; West, 2020). Checkpoint inhibitors are delivered by IV infusion every 2, 3, or 4 weeks over several months or up to 1 year. They are generally well tolerated with few adverse effects, particularly as compared to chemotherapeutic agents. Side effects include fatigue, rashes, and diarrhea (ACS, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s718">Palliative Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Palliative care, concurrent with standard oncologic care for lung cancer, should be considered early in the course of illness for any patient with metastatic cancer or high symptom burden. In lung cancer, palliative therapy may include radiation therapy to shrink the tumor to provide pain relief, a variety of bronchoscopic interventions to open a narrowed bronchus or airway, and pain management and other comfort measures. Evaluation and referral for hospice care are important in planning for comfortable and dignified end-of-life care for the patient and family (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for further discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s719">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A variety of complications may occur as a result of treatment of lung cancer. Surgical resection may result in respiratory failure, particularly if the cardiopulmonary system is compromised before surgery. Surgical complications and prolonged mechanical ventilation are potential outcomes. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page588" title="588"></span>Despite advances in improved delivery of radiation therapy, complications may still ensue, including diminished cardiopulmonary function and other complications, such as pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, myelitis, and cor pulmonale (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1465">Benveniste, Gomez, Brett, et al., 2019</a>). Chemotherapy, particularly in combination with radiation therapy, can cause pneumonitis. Pulmonary toxicity is a potential side effect of chemotherapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s720">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of patients with lung cancer is similar to that for other patients with cancer (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec07.xhtml#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>) and addresses the physiologic and psychological needs of the patient. The physiologic problems are primarily due to the respiratory manifestations of the disease. Nursing care includes strategies to ensure relief of pain and discomfort and to prevent complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient and family about the potential side effects of the specific treatment and strategies to manage them. Strategies for managing such symptoms as dyspnea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and anorexia help the patient and family cope with therapeutic measures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Breathing Problems</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Airway clearance techniques are key to maintaining airway patency through the removal of excess secretions. This may be accomplished through deep-breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, directed cough, suctioning, and in some instances bronchoscopy. Bronchodilator medications may be prescribed to promote bronchial dilation. As the tumor enlarges or spreads, it may compress a bronchus or involve a large area of lung tissue, resulting in an impaired breathing pattern and poor gas exchange. At some stage of the disease, supplemental oxygen will probably be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing measures focus on decreasing dyspnea by encouraging the patient to assume positions that promote lung expansion and to perform breathing exercises for lung expansion and relaxation. Patient education about energy conservation and airway clearance techniques is also necessary. Many of the techniques used in pulmonary rehabilitation can be applied to patients with lung cancer. Depending on the severity of disease and the patient&#x2019;s wishes, a referral to a pulmonary rehabilitation program may be helpful in managing respiratory symptoms.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Fatigue</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fatigue is a devastating symptom that affects quality of life in patients with cancer. It is commonly experienced by patients with lung cancer and may be related to the disease itself, the cancer treatment and complications (e.g., anemia), sleep disturbances, pain and discomfort, hypoxemia, poor nutrition, or the psychological ramifications of the disease (e.g., anxiety and depression) (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for nursing strategies to reduce fatigue).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Psychological Support</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Another important part of the nursing care of patients with lung cancer is provision of psychological support and identification of potential resources for the patient and family. Often, the nurse must help the patient and family deal with the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The poor prognosis and relatively rapid progression of this disease</span></li>
<li><span>Informed decision making regarding the possible treatment options</span></li>
<li><span>Methods to maintain the patient&#x2019;s quality of life during the course of this disease</span></li>
<li><span>End-of-life treatment options</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Oncology nurses are employed as <em>nurse navigators</em> in oncology practice settings to help patients and their families manage and coordinate the many challenging aspects of cancer care. Jeyathevan, Lemonde, and Cooper Brathwaite (2017) studied the effectiveness of the oncology nurse navigator role in helping patients and families deal with the complexities of a diagnosis of lung cancer (see Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c19-sec22.xhtml#ct19-26">Chart&#x00A0;19-26</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s721"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">At the time of diagnosis of lung cancer, most patients are older than 65 years and have stage III or IV disease (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Midthun, 2019</a>). In older patients, the management of a cancer is complex and challenging. Although age is not a significant prognostic factor for overall survival and response to treatment of either NSCLC or SCLC, older patients have specific needs. The presence of comorbidities and the patient&#x2019;s cognitive, functional, nutritional, and social status are important issues to consider with the patient of advanced age. Depending on the comorbidities and functional status of older adult patients, chemotherapy agents, doses, and cycles may need to be adjusted to maintain quality of life.</p>
