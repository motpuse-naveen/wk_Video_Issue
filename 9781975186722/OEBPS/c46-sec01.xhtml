<h4 class="h4a" id="s2020">DIABETES</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2021">Epidemiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is estimated that more than 34.1 million adults in the United States have diabetes, although almost one third of these cases are undiagnosed (CDC, 2020). The number of people older than 20 years newly diagnosed with diabetes increases by 1.7&#x00A0;million per year. If this trend continues, one in every three adults in the United States could have diabetes by 2050. In 2018, the percentage of adults with diabetes increased with age, reaching 28.3% of those age 65 years or older (CDC, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The rate of prediabetes is also steadily increasing. It is estimated that 35.5% of U.S. adults aged 18 years or older (88&#x00A0;million people) had prediabetes in 2018, based on laboratory findings. Nearly half (48.3%) of adults aged 65 years or older had prediabetes (CDC, 2020). Over $237 billion a year is spent in medical costs and $90 billion a year is lost in productivity related to diabetes (CDC, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Ethnic and racial minority populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes. The age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes is increasing among all gender and racial groups, but compared with Caucasians, African Americans, and members of other racial and ethnic groups (Native Americans and persons of Hispanic origin) are more likely to develop diabetes, are at greater risk for many of the complications, and have higher death rates due to diabetes (CDC, 2020). <a href="#ct46-1">Chart 46-1</a> summarizes risk factors for diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent">Diabetes can have far-reaching and devastating physical, social, and economic consequences, including the following (CDC, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3467">Virani, Alonso, Benjamin, et al., 2020</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).</span></li>
<li><span>Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of new blindness in adults aged 18 to 64 years.</span></li>
<li><span>Emergency department visits and hospitalization rates for adults and children with diabetes are greater than for the general population.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The economic cost of diabetes continues to increase because of increasing health care costs and an aging population.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2022">Classification</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The major classifications of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), and diabetes associated with other conditions or syndromes (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3446">American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2020</a>). The different types of diabetes vary in cause, clinical course, and treatment (see <a href="#tt46-1">Table 46-1</a>). The classification system is dynamic in two ways. First, research findings suggest many differences among individuals within each category. Second, except for people with type 1 diabetes, patients may move from one category to another. For example, a woman with gestational diabetes may, after delivery, move into type 2 diabetes. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prediabetes:&lt;/b&gt; impaired glucose metabolism in which blood glucose concentrations fall between normal levels and those considered diagnostic for diabetes; includes impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, not clinical entities in their own right but risk factors for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease">Prediabetes</button></strong> is classified as <strong>impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG)</strong> and refers to a condition in which blood glucose concentrations fall between normal levels and those considered diagnostic for diabetes (ADA, 2020; CDC, 2020).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2023"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Since that time, several risks for both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis to COVID-19 have been posed (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>). Epidemiologic data from China suggest that having any type of diabetes could be an important risk factor for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as for being hospitalized to manage COVID-19 (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3465">Sommerstein, Kochen, Messerli, et al., 2020</a>). Patients with diabetes who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have higher rates of intubation and mortality. Researchers who looked at 486 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 reported those who were older than 60 years of age, male, and had a history of diabetes were at greater risk of requiring intubation (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3457">Hur, Price, Gray, et al., 2020</a>). Another study reported that increased mortality in patients with diabetes was associated with older age, having a positive C-reactive protein laboratory finding, and being on insulin (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3448">Chen, Yang, Chen, et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;insulin:&lt;/b&gt; a hormone secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas that is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats; a deficiency of insulin results in diabetes">Insulin</button></strong> is a hormone secreted by beta cells, which are one of four types of cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). Insulin is an anabolic, or storage, hormone. When a person eats a meal, insulin secretion increases and moves glucose from the blood into muscle, liver, and fat cells. In those cells, insulin has the following actions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Transports and metabolizes glucose for energy</span></li>
<li><span>Stimulates storage of glucose in the liver and muscle (in the form of glycogen)</span></li>
<li><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1490" title="1490"></span>Signals the liver to stop the release of glucose</span></li>
<li><span>Enhances storage of dietary fat in adipose tissue</span></li>
<li><span>Accelerates transport of amino acids (derived from dietary protein) into cells</span></li>
<li><span>Inhibits the breakdown of stored glucose, protein, and fat</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">During fasting periods (between meals and overnight), the pancreas continuously releases a small amount of insulin (basal insulin); another pancreatic hormone called <em>glucagon</em> (secreted by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans) is released when blood glucose levels decrease, which stimulates the liver to release stored glucose. The insulin and the glucagon together maintain a constant level of glucose in the blood by stimulating the release of glucose from the liver.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, the liver produces glucose through glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen). After 8 to 12 hours without food, the liver forms glucose from the breakdown of noncarbohydrate substances, including amino acids, through the process of gluconeogenesis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Type 1 Diabetes</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;type 1 diabetes:&lt;/b&gt; a metabolic disorder characterized by an absence of insulin production and secretion from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas (&lt;em&gt;formerly&lt;/em&gt;: insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile diabetes)">Type 1 diabetes</button></strong> is characterized by the destruction of the pancreatic beta cells (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). Combined genetic, immunologic, and possibly environmental (e.g., viral) factors are thought to contribute to beta-cell destruction. Although the events that lead to beta-cell destruction are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that a genetic susceptibility is a common underlying factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. People do not inherit type 1 diabetes itself but rather a genetic predisposition, or tendency, toward the development of type 1 diabetes. This genetic tendency has been found in people with certain human leukocyte antigen types. There is also evidence of an autoimmune response in type 1 diabetes. This is an abnormal response in which antibodies are directed against normal tissues of the body, responding to these tissues as if they were foreign. Autoantibodies against islet cells and against endogenous (internal) insulin have been detected in people at the time of diagnosis and even several years before the development of clinical signs of type 1 diabetes. In addition to genetic and immunologic components, environmental factors such as viruses or toxins that may initiate destruction of the beta cell continue to be investigated.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the specific cause, the destruction of the beta cells results in decreased insulin production, increased glucose production by the liver, and fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, glucose derived from food cannot be stored in the liver but instead remains in the bloodstream and contributes to postprandial (after meals) hyperglycemia. If the concentration of glucose in the blood exceeds the renal threshold for glucose, usually 180 to 200 mg/dL (9.9 to 11.1 mmol/L), the kidneys may not reabsorb all of the filtered glucose; glycosuria then occurs (i.e., the glucose then appears in the urine). When excess glucose is excreted in the urine, it is accompanied by excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes. This is called <em>osmotic diuresis.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Because insulin normally inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, these processes occur in an unrestrained fashion in people with insulin deficiency and contribute further to hyperglycemia. In addition, fat breakdown occurs, resulting in an increased production of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ketone:&lt;/b&gt; a highly acidic substance formed when the liver breaks down free fatty acids in the absence of insulin">ketone</button></strong> bodies, a highly acidic substance formed when the liver breaks down free fatty acids in the absence of insulin.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong> is a metabolic derangement that occurs most commonly in persons with type 1 diabetes and results from a deficiency of insulin; highly acidic ketone bodies are formed, and metabolic acidosis occurs. The three major metabolic derangements are hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). DKA is commonly preceded by a day or more of polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue with eventual stupor and coma if not treated. The breath has a characteristic fruity odor due to the presence of ketoacids.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Type 2 Diabetes</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;type 2 diabetes:&lt;/b&gt; a metabolic disorder characterized by the relative deficiency of insulin production and a decreased insulin action and increased insulin resistance (&lt;em&gt;formerly:&lt;/em&gt; non&#x2013;insulin-dependent diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes)">Type 2 diabetes</button></strong> occurs more commonly among people who are older than 30 years and who have obesity, although its incidence is rapidly increasing in younger people because of the growing epidemic of obesity in children, adolescents, and young adults (CDC, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The two main problems related to insulin in type 2 diabetes are insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance refers to a decreased tissue sensitivity to insulin. Normally, insulin binds to special receptors on cell surfaces and initiates a series of reactions involved in glucose metabolism. In type 2 diabetes, these intracellular reactions are diminished, making insulin less effective at stimulating glucose uptake by the tissues and at regulating glucose release by the liver (see <a href="#ff46-1">Fig. 46-1</a>). The exact mechanisms that lead to insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes are unknown, although genetic factors are thought to play a role.</p>
<p class="indent">To overcome insulin resistance and to prevent the buildup of glucose in the blood, increased amounts of insulin must be secreted to maintain the glucose level at a normal or slightly elevated level. If the beta cells cannot keep up with the increased demand for insulin, the glucose level rises and type 2 diabetes develops. Insulin resistance may also lead to metabolic syndrome, which is a constellation of symptoms, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal obesity, and other abnormities (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the impaired insulin secretion that is characteristic of type 2 diabetes, there is enough insulin present to prevent the breakdown of fat and the accompanying production of ketone bodies. Therefore, DKA does not typically <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1491" title="1491"></span>occur in type 2 diabetes. However, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes may lead to another acute problem&#x2014;<strong>hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS)</strong> (see discussion later in chapter).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff46-1">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff46-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff46-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;46-1 &#x2022;</span> Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Because type 2 diabetes is associated with a slow, progressive glucose intolerance, its onset may go undetected for many years. If the patient experiences symptoms, they are frequently mild and may include fatigue, irritability, polyuria, polydipsia, poorly healing skin wounds, vaginal infections, or blurred vision (if glucose levels are very high).</p>
<p class="indent">For most patients (approximately 75%), type 2 diabetes is detected incidentally (e.g., when routine laboratory tests or ophthalmoscopic examinations are performed). One consequence of undetected diabetes is that long-term diabetes complications (e.g., eye disease, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease) may have developed before the actual diagnosis of diabetes is made (ADA, 2020), signifying that the blood glucose has been elevated for a time before diagnosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gestational Diabetes</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gestational diabetes:&lt;/b&gt; any degree of glucose intolerance with its onset during pregnancy">Gestational diabetes</button></strong> is any degree of glucose intolerance with its onset during pregnancy (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). Hyperglycemia develops during pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters, because of the secretion of placental hormones that cause insulin resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">Women who are considered to be at high risk for gestational diabetes and should be screened by blood glucose testing at their first prenatal visit are those with marked obesity, a personal history of gestational diabetes, glycosuria, or a strong family history of diabetes. High-risk ethnic groups include Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. If these high-risk women do not have gestational diabetes at initial screening, they should be retested between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. All women of average risk should be tested at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Testing is not specifically recommended for women identified as being at low risk. Low-risk women are those who meet all of the following criteria: age younger than 25 years, normal weight before pregnancy, member of an ethnic group with low prevalence of gestational diabetes, no history of abnormal glucose tolerance, no known history of diabetes in first-degree relatives, and no history of poor obstetric outcomes (ADA, 2020). Women considered to be at high or average risk should have either an oral glucose tolerance test or a glucose challenge test followed by an oral glucose tolerance test in women who exceed the glucose threshold value of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Initial management includes dietary modification and blood glucose monitoring. Between 70% and 85% of women with gestational diabetes can control blood glucose levels with lifestyle modifications alone. Dietary recommendations include a daily minimum of 175 g of carbohydrates, 71-g protein, 28-g fiber, and low saturated fats (ADA, 2020). If hyperglycemia persists, insulin is prescribed. Target ranges for blood glucose levels during pregnancy are 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8 to 10 mmol/L) (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">After delivery, blood glucose levels in women with gestational diabetes usually return to normal. However, many women who have had gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Women with a history of gestational diabetes should be screened for the development of diabetes or prediabetes every 3 years (ADA, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In adults, <strong>LADA</strong> is a subtype of diabetes in which the progression of autoimmune beta cell destruction in the pancreas is slower than in types 1 and 2 diabetes. Patients with LADA are at high risk of becoming insulin dependent. Most patients with LADA have at least two of the following: age of onset less than 50 years, body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, history of autoimmune disease, acute symptoms prior to diagnosis, or positive family history of autoimmune disease (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2025">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group (2002) reported that type 2 diabetes can be prevented with appropriate changes in lifestyle. Participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes (BMI greater than 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels elevated but not to levels diagnostic of diabetes) received standard lifestyle recommendations plus metformin, an oral antidiabetic agent; standard lifestyle recommendations plus placebo; or an intensive program of lifestyle modifications. The 16-lesson curriculum of the intensive program of lifestyle modifications focused on weight reduction of greater than 7% of initial body weight and physical activity of moderate intensity. It also included behavior modification strategies designed to help patients achieve the goals of weight reduction and participation in exercise. Compared to the placebo group, the lifestyle intervention group had a 58% lower incidence of diabetes and the metformin group had a 31% lower incidence of diabetes. These findings were found in both genders and all racial and ethnic groups. This research demonstrates that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed in persons at high risk for the disease (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3451">Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002</a>). The Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study followed participants for 15 years and demonstrated that those who enrolled in the program continued to develop type 2 diabetes at a lower rate compared to controls (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3452">Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Researchers have also reported in a study of more than 7000 participants followed for 8 years that those who took glucosamine, a supplement that decreases osteoarthritis and joint pain, had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those not taking the supplement (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3462">Ma, Li, Zhou, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2026">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations depend on the patient&#x2019;s level of hyperglycemia. Classic clinical manifestations of diabetes include the &#x201C;three Ps&#x201D;: <em>p</em>olyuria, <em>p</em>olydipsia, and <em>p</em>olyphagia. Polyuria (increased urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst) occur as a result of the excess loss of fluid associated with osmotic diuresis. Patients also experience polyphagia (increased appetite) that results from the catabolic state induced by insulin deficiency and the breakdown of proteins and fats (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). Other symptoms include fatigue and weakness, sudden vision changes, tingling or numbness in hands or feet, dry skin, skin lesions or wounds that are slow to heal, and recurrent infections. The onset of type 1 diabetes may also be associated with sudden weight loss or nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pains, if DKA has developed.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2027">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An abnormally high blood glucose level is the basic criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes. <strong>Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)</strong> (blood glucose determination obtained in the laboratory after fasting for at least 8 hours), random plasma glucose, and glucose level 2 hours after receiving glucose (2-hour postprandial load) may be used (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). See Chart&#x00A0;46-2 for the ADA&#x2019;s diagnostic criteria for diabetes (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the assessment and diagnostic evaluation performed to diagnose diabetes, ongoing specialized assessment of patients with known diabetes and evaluation for complications in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes are important components of care. Parameters that should be regularly assessed are discussed in <a href="#ct46-3">Chart 46-3</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2028"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetes is particularly prevalent in older adults. In fact, type 2 diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and affects approximately 20% of older adults (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). There is a high prevalence among African Americans and those who are 65 to 74 years of age (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Early detection is important but may be challenging because symptoms may be absent or nonspecific. A glucose tolerance test is more effective in diagnosis than urine testing for glucose in older patients due to the higher renal threshold for glucose (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2029">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The main goal of diabetes treatment is to normalize insulin activity and blood glucose levels to reduce the development of complications. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group (DCCT), a 10-year prospective clinical trial conducted from 1983 to 1993, demonstrated the importance of achieving blood glucose control in the normal, nondiabetic range. This landmark trial demonstrated that intensive glucose control dramatically reduced the development and progression of complications such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;retinopathy:&lt;/b&gt; a condition that occurs when the small blood vessels that nourish the retina in the eye are damaged">retinopathy</button></strong> (damage to small blood vessels that nourish the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1493" title="1493"></span>retina), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nephropathy:&lt;/b&gt; a long-term complication of diabetes in which the kidney cells are damaged; characterized by microalbuminuria in early stages and progressing to end-stage kidney disease">nephropathy</button></strong> (damage to kidney cells), and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neuropathy:&lt;/b&gt; a long-term complication of diabetes resulting from damage to the nerve cell">neuropathy</button></strong> (damage to nerve cells). Intensive treatment is defined as 3 or 4 insulin injections per day or an insulin pump (i.e., a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) plus frequent blood glucose monitoring and weekly contacts with diabetes educators (DCCT, 1993). The ADA recommends that all patients with diabetes strive for glucose control (HgbA<sub>1C</sub> less than 7%) to reduce their risk of complications (ADA, 2020a).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Intensive therapy must be initiated with caution and must be accompanied by thorough education of the patient and family and by responsible behavior of the patient. Careful screening of patients for capability and responsibility is a key step in initiating intensive therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The therapeutic goal for diabetes management is to achieve euglycemia (normal blood glucose levels) without <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypoglycemia:&lt;/b&gt; low blood glucose level">hypoglycemia</button></strong> while maintaining a high quality of life. Diabetes management has five components: nutritional therapy, exercise, monitoring, pharmacologic therapy, and education. Diabetes management involves constant assessment and modification of the treatment plan by health professionals and daily adjustments in therapy by the patient. Although the health care team directs the treatment, it is the individual patient who must manage the complex therapeutic regimen. For this reason, patient and family education is an essential component of diabetes treatment and is as important as all other components of the regimen.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nutrition, meal planning, weight control, and increased activity are the foundation of diabetes management (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3454">Evert, Dennison, Gardner, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3456">Franz, MacLeod, Evert, et al., 2017</a>). The most important objectives in the dietary and nutritional management of diabetes are control of total caloric intake to attain or maintain a reasonable body weight, control of blood glucose levels, and normalization of lipids and blood pressure to prevent heart disease. Success in this area alone is often associated with reversal of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. However, achieving these goals is not easy. Because <strong>medical nutrition therapy (MNT)</strong>&#x2014;nutritional therapy prescribed for management of diabetes usually given by a registered dietitian&#x2014;is complex, a registered dietitian who understands the therapy has the major responsibility for designing and educating about this aspect of the therapeutic plan. Nurses and all other members of the health care team must be knowledgeable about nutritional therapy and supportive of patients who need to implement nutritional and lifestyle changes. Nutritional management of diabetes includes the following goals:</p>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span>To achieve and maintain:</p>
<p class="NL2Middle"><span class="numah">a.</span>Blood glucose levels in the normal range or as close to normal as is safely possible</p>
<p class="NL2Middle"><span class="numah">b.</span>A lipid and lipoprotein profile that reduces the risk for vascular disease</p>
<p class="NL2Middle"><span class="numah">c.</span>Blood pressure levels in the normal range or as close to normal as is safely possible</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span>To prevent, or at least slow, the rate of development of the chronic complications of diabetes by modifying nutrient intake and lifestyle</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">3.</span>To address individual nutrition needs, taking into account personal and cultural preferences and willingness to change</p>
<p class="NL1Last"><span class="numah">4.</span>To maintain the pleasure of eating by only limiting food choices when indicated by scientific evidence</p>
<p class="indent"><img class="m" src="images/icon23.png" alt=""/> For patients who have obesity and diabetes (especially those with type 2 diabetes), weight loss is the key to treatment. (It is also a major factor in preventing diabetes.) In general, overweight is considered to be a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; obesity is defined as 20% above ideal body weight or a BMI equal to or greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (ADA, 2020; WHO, 2018). Calculation of BMI is discussed in <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, and obesity is discussed further in <a href="c42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>. Patients who have obesity, type 2 diabetes, and require insulin or oral agents to control blood glucose levels may be able to reduce or eliminate the need for medication through weight loss. A weight loss of 5% to 10% of total weight may significantly improve blood glucose levels. For patients who have obesity and diabetes but do not take insulin or an oral antidiabetic medication, consistent meal content or timing is important but not as critical. Rather, decreasing the overall caloric intake is of greater importance. Meals should not be skipped. Pacing food intake throughout the day decreases demands on the pancreas.</p>
<p class="indent">The actions of several oral antidiabetic medications include weight loss. For example, the glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are associated with delayed gastric emptying and weight loss. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glucose control assisting with weight loss (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Keresztes &#x0026; Peacock-Johnson, 2019</a>). See discussion later in the chapter about oral antidiabetic medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Consistently following a meal plan is one of the most challenging aspects of diabetes management. It may be more realistic to restrict calories only moderately. For patients who have lost weight incorporating new dietary habits into their lifestyles, diet education, behavioral therapy, group support, and ongoing nutrition counseling are encouraged to maintain weight loss.</p>
<p class="h7">Meal Planning and Related Education</p>
<p class="nonindent">The meal plan must consider the patient&#x2019;s food preferences, lifestyle, usual eating times, and ethnic and cultural background. For patients who require insulin to help control blood glucose levels, maintaining as much consistency as possible in the amount of calories and carbohydrates ingested at each meal is essential. In addition, consistency in the approximate time intervals between meals, with the addition of snacks if necessary, helps prevent hypoglycemic reactions and maintain overall blood glucose control. For patients who can master the insulin-to-carbohydrate calculations, lifestyle can be more flexible and diabetes control more predictable. For those using intensive insulin therapy, there may be greater flexibility in the timing and content of meals by allowing adjustments in insulin dosage for changes in eating and exercise habits. Newer insulin analogues, insulin algorithms, and insulin pumps permit greater flexibility of schedules than was previously possible. This contrasts with the concept of maintaining a constant dose of insulin, requiring strict scheduling of meals to match the onset and duration of the insulin.</p>
<p class="indent">The first step in preparing a meal plan is a thorough review of the patient&#x2019;s diet history to identify eating habits and lifestyle and cultural eating patterns (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Franz et al., 2017</a>). This includes a thorough assessment of the patient&#x2019;s need for weight loss, gain, or maintenance. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1494" title="1494"></span>In most instances, people with type 2 diabetes require weight reduction.</p>
<p class="indent">In educating about meal planning, clinical dietitians use various tools, materials, and approaches. Initial education addresses the importance of consistent eating habits, the relationship of food and insulin, and the provision of an individualized meal plan. In-depth follow-up education then focuses on management skills, such as eating at restaurants; reading food labels; and adjusting the meal plan for exercise, illness, and special occasions. The nurse plays an important role in communicating pertinent information to the dietitian and reinforcing the patient&#x2019;s understanding. Communication between the team is important.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain aspects of meal planning, such as the food exchange system, may be difficult to learn. This may be related to limitations in the patient&#x2019;s intellectual level or to emotional issues, such as difficulty accepting the diagnosis of diabetes or feelings of deprivation and undue restriction in eating. In any case, it helps to emphasize that using the exchange system (or any food classification system) provides a new way of thinking about food rather than a new way of eating. It is also important to simplify information as much as possible and to provide opportunities for the patient to practice and repeat activities and information.</p>
<p class="h8">Caloric Requirements</p>
<p class="nonindent">Calorie-controlled diets are planned by first calculating a person&#x2019;s energy needs and caloric requirements based on age, gender, height, and weight. An activity element is then factored in to provide the actual number of calories required for weight maintenance. To promote a 1- to 2-lb weight loss per week, 500 to 1000 calories are subtracted from the daily total. The calories are distributed into carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and a meal plan is then developed, taking into account the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle and food preferences.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may be underweight at the onset of type 1 diabetes because of rapid weight loss from severe hyperglycemia. The goal initially may be to provide a higher-calorie diet to regain lost weight and blood glucose control.</p>
<p class="h8">Caloric Distribution</p>
<p class="nonindent">A meal plan for diabetes focuses on the percentages of calories that come from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Franz et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Carbohydrates.</strong></span> The caloric distribution currently recommended is higher in carbohydrates than in fat and protein. In general, carbohydrate foods have the greatest effect on blood glucose levels because they are more quickly digested than other foods and are converted into glucose rapidly. However, research into the appropriateness of a higher-carbohydrate diet in patients with decreased glucose tolerance is ongoing, and recommendations may change accordingly. Currently, the ADA and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association) recommend that for all levels of caloric intake, 50% to 60% of calories should be derived from carbohydrates, 20% to 30% from fat, and the remaining 10% to 20% from protein (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>). The majority of the selections for carbohydrates should come from whole grains. These recommendations are also consistent with those of the American Heart Association and American Cancer Society.</p>
<p class="indent">Carbohydrates consist of sugars (e.g., sucrose) and starches (e.g., rice, pasta, bread). Low glycemic index diets (described later) may reduce postprandial glucose levels. Therefore, the nutrition guidelines recommend that all carbohydrates should be eaten in moderation to avoid high postprandial blood glucose levels (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Franz et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Foods high in carbohydrates, such as sucrose (concentrated sweets), are not totally eliminated from the diet but should be eaten in moderation (up to 10% of total calories), because they are typically high in fat and lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Fats.</strong></span> The recommendations regarding fat content of the diabetic diet include both reducing the total percentage of calories from fat sources to less than 30% of total calories and limiting the amount of saturated fats to 10% of total calories. Additional recommendations include limiting the total intake of dietary cholesterol to less than 300 mg/day. This approach may help reduce risk factors such as increased serum cholesterol levels, which are associated with the development of coronary artery disease&#x2014;the leading cause of death and disability among people with diabetes (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Protein.</strong></span> The meal plan may include the use of some nonanimal sources of protein (e.g., legumes, whole grains) to help reduce saturated fat and cholesterol intake. In addition, the amount of protein intake may be reduced in patients with early signs of kidney disease.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Fiber.</strong></span> Increased fiber in the diet may improve blood glucose levels, decrease the need for exogenous insulin, and lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in the blood (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of dietary fibers: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber&#x2014;in foods such as legumes, oats, and some fruits&#x2014;plays more of a role in lowering blood glucose and lipid levels than does insoluble fiber, although the clinical significance of this effect is probably small (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>). Soluble fiber slows stomach emptying and the movement of food through the upper digestive tract. The potential glucose-lowering effect of fiber may be caused by the slower rate of glucose absorption from foods that contain soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber is found in whole-grain breads and cereals and in some vegetables. This type of fiber along with soluble fiber increases satiety, which is helpful for weight loss. At least 28 g of fiber should be ingested daily (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">One risk involved in suddenly increasing fiber intake is that it may require adjusting the dosage of insulin or oral agents to prevent hypoglycemia. Other problems may include abdominal fullness, nausea, diarrhea, increased flatulence, and constipation if fluid intake is inadequate. If fiber is added to or increased in the meal plan, it should be done gradually and in consultation with a dietitian. Exchange lists (ADA, 2020) serve as an excellent guide for increasing fiber intake. Fiber-rich food choices within the vegetable, fruit, and starch/bread exchanges are highlighted in the lists.</p>
<p class="h8">Food Classification Systems</p>
<p class="nonindent">To educate about diet principles and help in meal planning, several systems have been developed in which foods are organized into groups with common characteristics, such as number of calories, composition of foods (i.e., amount of protein, fat, carbohydrate in the food), or effect on blood glucose levels. Several of these are listed next.</p>

There are six main exchange lists: bread/starch, vegetable, milk, meat, fruit, and fat. Foods within one group (in the portion amounts specified) contain equal numbers of calories and are approximately equal in grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Meal plans can be based on a recommended number of choices from each exchange list. Foods on one list may be interchanged with one another, allowing for variety while maintaining as much consistency as possible in the nutrient content of foods eaten. <a href="#tt46-2">Table 46-2</a> presents three sample lunch menus that are interchangeable in terms of carbohydrate, protein, and fat content.</p>
<p class="indent">Exchange list information on combination foods such as pizza, chili, and casseroles, as well as convenience foods, desserts, snack foods, and fast foods, is available from the ADA (see the Resources section). Some food manufacturers and restaurants publish exchange lists that describe their products.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Nutrition Labels.</strong></span> Food manufacturers are required to have the nutrition content of foods listed on their packaging, and reading food labels is an important skill for patients to learn and use when food shopping. The label includes information about how many grams of carbohydrate are in a serving of food. This information can be used to determine how much medication is needed. For example, a patient who takes premeal insulin may use the algorithm of 1 unit of insulin for 15 g of carbohydrate. Patients can also be educated to have a &#x201C;carbohydrate budget&#x201D; per meal (e.g., 45 to 60 g).</p>
<p class="indent">Carbohydrate counting is a nutritional tool used for blood glucose management because carbohydrates are the main nutrients in food that influence blood glucose levels. This method provides flexibility in food choices, can be less complicated to understand than the diabetic food exchange list, and allows more accurate management with multiple daily injections (insulin before each meal). However, if carbohydrate counting is not used with other meal-planning techniques, weight gain can result. A variety of methods are used to count carbohydrates. When developing a diabetic meal plan using carbohydrate counting, all food sources should be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">Once digested, 100% of carbohydrates are converted to glucose. Approximately 50% of protein foods (meat, fish, and poultry) are also converted to glucose, and this has minimal effect on blood glucose levels.</p>
<p class="indent">While carbohydrate counting is commonly used for blood glucose management with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it is not a perfect system. All carbohydrates affect the blood glucose level to different degrees, regardless of equivalent serving size (i.e., the glycemic index&#x2014;see later discussion). When carbohydrate counting is used, reading labels on food items is the key to success. Knowing what the &#x201C;carbohydrate budget&#x201D; for the meal is and knowing how many grams of carbohydrate are in a serving of a food, the patient can calculate the amount in one serving.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Healthy Food Choices.</strong></span> An alternative to counting grams of carbohydrate is measuring servings or choices. This method is used more often by people with type 2 diabetes. It is similar to the food exchange list and emphasizes portion control of total servings of carbohydrate at meals and snacks. One carbohydrate serving is equivalent to 15 g of carbohydrate. Examples of one serving are an apple 2 inches in diameter and one slice of bread. Vegetables and meat are counted as one third of a carbohydrate serving. This system works well for those who have difficulty with more complicated systems.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>MyPlate Food Guide.</strong></span> The Food Guide (i.e., MyPlate) is another tool used to develop meal plans. It is commonly used for patients with type 2 diabetes who have a difficult time following a calorie-controlled diet. Foods are categorized into five major groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and protein), plus fats and oils (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="c04-sec04.xhtml#ff4-5">Fig. 4-5</a>). Foods (grains, fruits, and vegetables) that are lowest in calories and fat and highest in fiber should make up the basis of the diet. For those with diabetes, as well as for the general population, 50% to 60% of the daily caloric intake should be from these three groups. Foods higher in fat (particularly saturated fat) should account for a smaller percentage of the daily caloric intake. Fats, oils, and sweets should be used sparingly to obtain weight and blood glucose control and to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Reliance on MyPlate may result in fluctuations in blood glucose levels, however, because high-carbohydrate foods may be grouped with low-carbohydrate foods. The guide is appropriately used only as a first-step educational tool for patients who are learning how to control food portions and how to identify which foods contain carbohydrate, protein, and fat.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Glycemic Index.</strong></span> One of the main goals of diet therapy in diabetes is to avoid sharp, rapid increases in blood glucose levels after food is eaten. The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;glycemic index:&lt;/b&gt; the amount a given food increases the blood glucose level compared with an equivalent amount of glucose">glycemic index</button></strong> is used to describe how much a given food increases the blood glucose level compared with an equivalent amount of glucose. The effects of the use of the glycemic index on blood glucose levels <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1496" title="1496"></span>and on long-term patient outcomes are unclear, but it may be beneficial (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>). Although more research is necessary, the following guidelines may be helpful when making dietary recommendations:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Combining starchy foods with protein- and fat-containing foods tends to slow their absorption and lower the glycemic index.</span></li>
<li><span>In general, eating foods that are raw and whole results in a lower glycemic index than eating chopped, pur&#x00E9;ed, or cooked foods (except meat).</span></li>
<li><span>Eating whole fruit instead of drinking juice decreases the glycemic index, because fiber in the fruit slows absorption.</span></li>
<li><span>Adding foods with sugars to the diet may result in a lower glycemic index if these foods are eaten with foods that are more slowly absorbed.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patients can create their own glycemic index by monitoring their blood glucose level after ingestion of a particular food. This can help improve blood glucose control through individualized manipulation of the diet. Many patients who use frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels can use this information to adjust their insulin doses in accordance with variations in food intake.</p>
<p class="h7">Other Dietary Concerns</p>
<p class="h8">Alcohol Consumption</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with diabetes do not need to give up alcoholic beverages entirely, but patients and primary providers must be aware of the potential adverse effects of alcohol specific to diabetes. Alcohol is absorbed before other nutrients and does not require insulin for absorption. Large amounts can be converted to fats, increasing the risk for DKA. In general, the same precautions regarding the use of alcohol by people without diabetes should be applied to patients with diabetes. Moderation is recommended. A major danger of alcohol consumption by the patient with diabetes is hypoglycemia, especially for patients who take insulin or insulin secretagogues (medications that increase the secretion of insulin by the pancreas). Alcohol may decrease the normal physiologic reactions in the body that produce glucose (gluconeogenesis). Therefore, if a patient with diabetes consumes alcohol on an empty stomach, there is an increased likelihood of hypoglycemia. In addition, excessive alcohol intake may impair the patient&#x2019;s ability to recognize and treat hypoglycemia or to follow a prescribed meal plan to prevent hypoglycemia. To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, the patient should be cautioned to consume food along with the alcohol; however, carbohydrate consumed with alcohol may raise blood glucose.</p>
<p class="indent">Alcohol consumption may lead to excessive weight gain (from the high caloric content of alcohol), hyperlipidemia, and elevated glucose levels (especially with mixed drinks and liqueurs). Patient education regarding alcohol intake must emphasize moderation in the amount of alcohol consumed. Moderate intake is considered to be one alcoholic beverage per day for women and two per day for men. Lower-calorie or less-sweet drinks (e.g., light beer, wine) and food intake along with alcohol consumption are advised (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Evert et al., 2019</a>). Patients with type 2 diabetes who wish to control their weight should incorporate the calories from alcohol into the overall meal plan.</p>
<p class="h8">Sweeteners</p>
<p class="nonindent">The use of artificial sweeteners is acceptable, especially if it assists in overall dietary adherence. Moderation in the amount of sweetener used is encouraged to avoid potential adverse effects. There are two main types of sweeteners: nutritive and nonnutritive. The nutritive sweeteners contain calories, and the nonnutritive sweeteners have few or no calories in the amounts normally used.</p>
<p class="indent">Nutritive sweeteners include fructose (fruit sugar), sorbitol, and xylitol, all of which provide calories in amounts similar to those in sucrose (table sugar). They cause less elevation in blood sugar levels than sucrose does and are often used in sugar-free foods. Sweeteners containing sorbitol may have a laxative effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Nonnutritive sweeteners have minimal or no calories. They are used in food products and are also available for table use. They produce minimal or no elevation in blood glucose levels, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists them as safe for people with diabetes.</p>
<p class="h8">Misleading Food Labels</p>
<p class="nonindent">Foods labeled &#x201C;sugarless&#x201D; or &#x201C;sugar-free&#x201D; may still provide calories equal to those of the equivalent sugar-containing products if they are made with nutritive sweeteners. Therefore, these foods should not be considered &#x201C;free&#x201D; foods to be eaten in unlimited quantity, because they can elevate blood glucose levels. Foods labeled &#x201C;dietetic&#x201D; are not necessarily reduced-calorie foods. Patients are advised that foods labeled dietetic may still contain significant amounts of sugar or fat.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients must read the labels of &#x201C;health foods&#x201D;&#x2014;especially snacks&#x2014;because they often contain carbohydrates (e.g., honey, brown sugar, corn syrup, flour) and saturated vegetable fats (e.g., coconut or palm oil), hydrogenated vegetable fats, or animal fats, which may be contraindicated in people with elevated blood lipid levels.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Exercise</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Exercise is extremely important in diabetes management because of its effects on lowering blood glucose and reducing cardiovascular risk factors (ADA, 2020). Exercise lowers blood glucose levels by increasing the uptake of glucose by body muscles and by improving insulin utilization. It also improves circulation and muscle tone. Resistance (strength) training, such as weight lifting, can increase lean muscle mass, thereby increasing the resting metabolic rate. These effects are useful in diabetes in relation to losing weight, easing stress, and maintaining a feeling of well-being. Exercise also alters blood lipid concentrations, increasing levels of high-density lipoproteins and decreasing total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This is especially important for people with diabetes because of their increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p class="h7">Exercise Recommendations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ideally, a person with diabetes should engage in regular exercise. General considerations for exercise in patients with diabetes are presented in <a href="#ct46-4">Chart 46-4</a>. Exercise recommendations must be altered as necessary for patients with diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, sensorimotor neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (ADA, 2020). Increased blood pressure associated with exercise may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1497" title="1497"></span>aggravate diabetic retinopathy and increase the risk of a hemorrhage into the vitreous or retina.</p>

<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Adapted from American Diabetes Association (ADA). (2020). Standards of medical care in diabetes&#x2014;2020. <em>Diabetes Care</em>, <em>43</em>(Suppl 1), S1&#x2013;S212.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In general, a slow, gradual increase in the exercise period is encouraged. For many patients, walking is a safe and beneficial form of exercise that requires no special equipment (except for proper shoes) and can be performed anywhere. People with diabetes should discuss an exercise program with their primary provider and undergo a careful medical evaluation with appropriate diagnostic studies before beginning a program (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are older than 30 years and who have two or more risk factors for heart disease, an exercise stress test is recommended prior to starting an exercise program (ADA, 2020). Risk factors for heart disease include hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol levels, abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG), sedentary lifestyle, smoking, male gender, and a family history of heart disease. An abnormal stress test may indicate cardiac ischemia. Typically, an abnormal stress test is followed by a cardiac catheterization and, in some cases, with an intervention such as angioplasty, stent placement, or cardiac surgery.</p>
<p class="h7">Exercise Precautions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who have blood glucose levels exceeding 250 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) and who have ketones in their urine should not begin exercising until the urine test results are negative for ketones and the blood glucose level is closer to normal. Exercising with elevated blood glucose levels increases the secretion of glucagon, growth hormone, and catecholamines. The liver then releases more glucose, and the result is an increase in the blood glucose level (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The physiologic decrease in circulating insulin that normally occurs with exercise cannot occur in patients treated with insulin. Initially, patients who require insulin should be taught to eat a 15-g carbohydrate snack (a fruit exchange) or a snack of complex carbohydrates with a protein before engaging in moderate exercise to prevent unexpected hypoglycemia. The exact amount of food needed varies from person to person and should be determined by blood glucose monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent">Another concern for patients who take insulin is hypoglycemia that occurs many hours after exercise. To avoid post-exercise hypoglycemia, especially after strenuous or prolonged exercise, the patient may need to eat a snack at the end of the exercise session and at bedtime and monitor the blood glucose level more frequently. Patients who are capable, knowledgeable, and responsible can learn to adjust their own insulin doses by working closely with a diabetes educator. Others need specific instructions on what to do when they exercise.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients taking insulin and participating in extended periods of exercise should test their blood glucose levels before, during, and after the exercise period, and they should snack on carbohydrates as needed to maintain blood glucose levels. Other participants or observers should be aware that the person exercising has diabetes, and they should know what assistance to give if severe hypoglycemia occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">In people with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or have obesity, exercise in addition to dietary management both improves glucose metabolism and enhances loss of body fat. Exercise coupled with weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and may decrease the need for insulin or oral antidiabetic agents (ADA, 2020). Eventually, the patient&#x2019;s glucose tolerance may return to normal. Patients with type 2 diabetes who are not taking insulin or an oral agent may not need extra food before exercise.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Physical activity that is consistent and realistic is beneficial to older adults with diabetes. Physical fitness in the older adult population with diabetes may lead to improved glycemic control, decreased risk for chronic vascular disease, and an improved quality of life (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Advantages of exercise in this population include a decrease in hyperglycemia, a general sense of well-being, and better use of ingested calories, resulting in weight reduction. Because there is an increased incidence of cardiovascular problems in older adults, a physical examination and exercise stress test may be warranted before an exercise program is initiated. A pattern of gradual, consistent exercise, including a combination of stretching, aerobic exercise, and resistance training, should be planned that does not exceed the patient&#x2019;s physical capacity. Physical impairment because of other chronic diseases must also be considered. In some cases, a physical therapy evaluation may be indicated, with the goal of determining exercises specific to the patient&#x2019;s needs and abilities. Tools such as the Go4Life senior fitness booklet may be helpful (see Resources section at the end of chapter).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Glucose Levels and Ketones</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Blood glucose monitoring is a cornerstone of diabetes management, and <strong>self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)</strong> levels have dramatically altered diabetes care. SMBG is a method of capillary blood glucose testing in which the patient pricks their finger and applies a drop of blood to a test strip that is read by a meter. It is recommended that SMBG occurs when circumstances call for it (e.g., before meals, snacks, exercise) for many patients taking insulin (ADA, 2020).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1497</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1498" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1498">p. 1498</span></div>
<p class="h7">Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose</p>
<p class="nonindent">Using SMBG and learning how to respond to the results enable people with diabetes to individualize their treatment regimen to obtain optimal blood glucose control. This allows for detection and prevention of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and plays a crucial role in normalizing blood glucose levels, which in turn may reduce the risk of long-term diabetic complications.</p>
<p class="indent">Various methods for SMBG are available. Most involve obtaining a drop of blood from the fingertip, applying the blood to a special reagent strip, and allowing the blood to stay on the strip for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer (usually 5 to 30 seconds). The meter gives a digital readout of the blood glucose value. The meters available for SMBG offer various features and benefits such as monthly averages, tracking of events such as exercise and food consumption, and downloading capacity. Most meters are biosensors that can use blood obtained from alternative test sites, such as the forearm. There is a special lancing device that is useful for patients who have painful fingertips or experience pain with fingersticks.</p>
<p class="indent">Because laboratory methods measure plasma glucose, most blood glucose monitors approved for patient use in the home and some test strips calibrate blood glucose readings to plasma values. Plasma glucose values are 10% to 15% higher than whole blood glucose values, and it is crucial for patients with diabetes to know whether their monitor and strips provide whole blood or plasma results.</p>
<p class="indent">Methods for SMBG must match the skill level and physical capabilities of patients. Factors affecting SMBG performance include visual acuity, fine motor coordination, cognitive ability, comfort with technology and willingness to use it, and cost (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Some meters can be used by patients with visual impairments; these meters have audio components to assist in performing the test and obtaining the result. In addition, meters are available to check both blood glucose and blood ketone levels by those who are particularly susceptible to DKA. Most insurance companies, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, cover some or all of the costs of meters and strips.</p>
<p class="indent">All methods of SMBG carry the risk that patients may obtain and report erroneous blood glucose values as a result of incorrect techniques. Some common sources of error include improper application of blood (e.g., drop too small), damage to the reagent strips caused by heat or humidity, the use of outdated strips, and improper meter cleaning and maintenance.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses play an important role in providing initial education about SMBG techniques. Equally important is evaluating the techniques of patients who are experienced in self-monitoring. Every 6 to 12 months, patients should conduct a comparison of their meter result with a simultaneous laboratory-measured blood glucose level in their provider&#x2019;s office and have their technique observed. The accuracy of the meter and strips can also be assessed with control solutions specific to that meter whenever a new vial of strips is used and whenever the validity of the reading is in doubt.</p>
<p class="h8">Candidates for Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose</p>
<p class="nonindent">SMBG is a useful tool for managing self-care for everyone with diabetes. It is a key component of treatment for any intensive insulin therapy regimen (i.e., 2 to 4 injections per day or the use of an insulin pump) and for diabetes management during pregnancy. It is also recommended for patients with the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Unstable diabetes (severe swings from very high to very low blood glucose levels within a 24-hour day)</span></li>
<li><span>A tendency to develop severe ketosis or hypoglycemia</span></li>
<li><span>Hypoglycemia without warning symptoms</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">For patients not taking insulin, SMBG is helpful for monitoring the effectiveness of exercise, diet, and oral antidiabetic agents. For patients with type 2 diabetes, SMBG is recommended during periods of suspected hyperglycemia (e.g., illness) or hypoglycemia (e.g., unusual increased activity levels) and when the medication or dosage of medication is modified (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h8">Frequency of Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose</p>
<p class="nonindent">For most patients who require insulin, SMBG is recommended two to four times daily (usually before meals and at bedtime). For patients who take insulin before each meal, SMBG is required at least three times daily before meals to determine each dose (ADA, 2020). Those not receiving insulin may be instructed to assess their blood glucose levels at least two or three times per week, including a 2-hour postprandial test. For all patients, testing is recommended whenever hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia is suspected; with changes in medications, activity, or diet; and with stress or illness.</p>
<p class="h8">Responding to Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Results</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are asked to keep a record or logbook of blood glucose levels so that they can detect patterns. Testing is done at the peak action time of the medication to evaluate the need for dosage adjustments. To evaluate basal insulin and determine bolus insulin doses, testing is performed before meals. To determine the need for bolus doses of regular or rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, or glulisine), testing is done 2 hours after meals. Patients with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to test daily before and 2 hours after the largest meal of the day until individualized blood glucose levels are reached. Thereafter, testing should be done periodically before and after meals. Patients who take insulin at bedtime or who use an insulin infusion pump should also test at 3 am once a week to document that the blood glucose level is not decreasing during the night. If the patient is unwilling or cannot afford to test frequently, then once or twice a day may be sufficient if the time of testing is varied (e.g., before breakfast one day, before lunch the next day).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients are more likely to discontinue SMBG if they are not instructed how to use the results to alter the treatment regimen, if they receive no positive reinforcement, and if testing costs increase. At the very least, the patient should be given parameters for contacting the primary provider. Patients using intensive insulin therapy regimens may be instructed in the use of algorithms (rules or decision trees) for changing the insulin doses based on patterns of values greater or less than the target range and the amount of carbohydrate to be consumed. Baseline patterns should be established by SMBG for 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="h7">Using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System</p>
<p class="nonindent">A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system is an advanced way that people living with diabetes can use to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1499" title="1499"></span>monitor blood glucose levels. A CGM can be used with or without an insulin pump (see <a href="#ff46-2">Fig. 46-2</a>A). A sensor attached to a transmitter is inserted subcutaneously in the abdomen or back of the arm and connected to a wireless monitoring device, where the glucose levels are displayed in real time (see <a href="#ff46-2">Fig. 46-2</a>B). Sensors are replaced every 7 to 14 days. The data from the CGM device are downloaded, and blood glucose readings are analyzed. The newest CGM is implantable and can be worn for 90 days (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3461">Kropff, Choudhary, Neupane, et al., 2017</a>). Although the CGM cannot be used for making decisions about specific insulin doses, it can be used to determine whether treatment is adequate over a 24-hour period. This device is most useful in patients with type 1 diabetes (ADA, 2020).</p>

<p class="h7">Testing for Glycated Hemoglobin</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;glycated hemoglobin:&lt;/b&gt; a measure of glucose control that is a result of glucose molecule attaching to hemoglobin for the life of the red blood cell (120 days) (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: glycosylated hemoglobin, HgbA&lt;sub&gt;1C&lt;/sub&gt;, or A1C)">Glycated hemoglobin</button></strong> (also referred to as glycosylated hemoglobin, HgbA<sub>1C</sub>, or A1C) is a measure of glucose control for the past 3 months (ADA, 2020). When blood glucose levels are elevated, glucose molecules attach to hemoglobin in red blood cells. The longer the amount of glucose in the blood remains above normal, the more glucose binds to hemoglobin and the higher the glycated hemoglobin level becomes. This complex (hemoglobin attached to the glucose) is permanent and lasts for the life of an individual red blood cell, approximately 120 days. If near-normal blood glucose levels are maintained, with only occasional increases, the overall value will not be greatly elevated. However, if the blood glucose values are consistently high, then the test result is also elevated. If the patient reports mostly normal SMBG results but the glycated hemoglobin is high, there may be errors in the methods used for glucose monitoring, errors in recording results, or frequent elevations in glucose levels at times during the day when the patient is not usually monitoring blood sugar levels. Normal values typically range from 4% to 6% and indicate consistently near-normal blood glucose concentrations. The target range for people with diabetes is less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h7">Testing for Ketones</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ketones (or ketone bodies) are by-products of fat breakdown, and they accumulate in the blood and urine. Ketones in the urine signal that there is a deficiency of insulin and control of type 1 diabetes is deteriorating. When there is almost no effective insulin available, the body starts to break down stored fat for energy.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may use a urine dipstick (Ketostix or Chemstrip uK) to detect ketonuria. The reagent pad on the strip turns purple when ketones are present. (One of the ketone bodies is called <em>acetone,</em> and this term is frequently used interchangeably with the term <em>ketones.</em>) Other strips are available for measuring both urine glucose and ketones (Keto-Diastix or Chemstrip uGK). Large amounts of ketones may depress the color response of the glucose test area, meters that text the blood for ketones are available.</p>
<p class="indent">Urine ketone testing should be performed whenever patients with type 1 diabetes have glycosuria or persistently elevated blood glucose levels (more than 240 mg/dL or 13.2&#x00A0;mmol/L for two testing periods in a row) and during illness, in pregnancy with preexisting diabetes, and in gestational diabetes (ADA, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans and lowers the blood glucose level after meals by facilitating the uptake and utilization of glucose by muscle, fat, and liver cells. In the absence of adequate insulin, pharmacologic therapy is essential.</p>
<p class="h7">Insulin Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">In type 1 diabetes, exogenous insulin must be given for life because the body loses the ability to produce insulin. In type 2 diabetes, insulin may be necessary on a long-term basis to control glucose levels if meal planning and oral agents are ineffective or when insulin deficiency occurs. In addition, some patients in whom type 2 diabetes is usually controlled by meal planning alone or by meal planning and an oral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1500" title="1500"></span>antidiabetic agent may require insulin temporarily during illness, infection, pregnancy, surgery, or some other stressful event. In many cases, insulin injections are given two or more times daily to control the blood glucose level. Because the insulin dose required by the individual patient is determined by the level of glucose in the blood, accurate monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential; thus, SMBG is a cornerstone of insulin therapy.</p>

<p class="h8">Preparations</p>
<p class="nonindent">A number of insulin preparations are available. They vary according to three main characteristics: time course of action, species (source), and manufacturer (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Human insulins are produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology and are the only type of insulin available in the United States.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Time Course of Action.</strong></span> Insulins may be grouped into several categories based on the onset, peak, and duration of action (see <a href="#tt46-3">Table 46-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Rapid-acting insulins produce a more rapid effect that is of shorter duration than regular insulin. Because of their rapid onset, the patient should be instructed to eat no more than 5 to 15 minutes after injection. Because of the short duration of action of these insulin analogues, patients with type 1 diabetes and some patients with type 2 or gestational diabetes also require a long-acting insulin (basal insulin) to maintain glucose control. Basal insulin is necessary to maintain blood glucose levels irrespective of meals. A constant level of insulin is required at all times. Intermediate-acting insulins function as basal insulins but may have to be split into 2 injections to achieve 24-hour coverage.</p>
<p class="indent">Short-acting insulins are called <em>regular insulin</em> (marked R on the bottle). Regular insulin is a clear solution and is usually given 15 minutes before a meal, either alone or in combination with a longer-acting insulin. Regular insulin can be administered IV (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Intermediate-acting insulins are called <em>NPH insulin</em> (neutral protamine Hagedorn), which are similar in their time course of action, appear uniformly milky and cloudy. If an NPH insulin is taken alone, it is not crucial that it be taken before a meal but patients should eat some food around the time of the onset and peak of these insulins.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Peakless&#x201D; basal or long-acting insulins are used as a basal insulin&#x2014;that is, the insulin is absorbed very slowly over 24&#x00A0;hours and can be given once a day (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Because the insulin is in a suspension with a pH of 4, it cannot be mixed with other insulins because this would cause precipitation. It is administered once a day at any time of the day but must be given at the same time each day to prevent overlap of action. Many patients fall asleep, forgetting to take their bedtime insulin, or may be wary of taking insulin before going to sleep. Having these patients take their insulin in the morning ensures that the dose is taken.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When administering insulin, it is very important to read the label carefully and to be sure that the correct type and dose of insulin is given.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The nurse should emphasize which meals&#x2014;and snacks&#x2014;are being &#x201C;covered&#x201D; by which insulin doses. In general, the rapid- and short-acting insulins are expected to cover the increase in glucose levels after meals, immediately after the injection; the intermediate-acting insulins are expected to cover subsequent meals; and the long-acting insulins provide a relatively constant level of insulin and act as a basal insulin.</p>
<p class="h8">Insulin Regimens</p>
<p class="nonindent">Insulin regimens vary from 1 to 4 injections per day. Usually, there is a combination of a short-acting insulin and a longer-acting insulin. The normally functioning pancreas continuously secretes small amounts of insulin during the day and night. In addition, whenever blood glucose increases after ingestion of food, there is a rapid burst of insulin secretion in proportion to the glucose-raising effect of the food. The goal of all but the simplest, 1-injection insulin regimens is to mimic this normal pattern of insulin secretion in response to food intake and activity patterns. <a href="#tt46-4">Table 46-4</a> describes several insulin regimens and the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two general approaches to insulin therapy: conventional and intensive (described in detail later). The patient can learn to use SMBG results and carbohydrate counting to vary the insulin doses. This allows more flexibility in timing and content of meals and exercise periods. However, complex insulin regimens require a strong level of commitment, intensive education, and close follow-up by the health care team.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient should be very involved in the decision regarding which insulin regimen to use. The patient should compare the potential benefits of different regimens with the potential costs (e.g., time involved, number of injections, fingersticks for glucose testing, amount of record keeping). There are no set guidelines as to which insulin regimen should be used for which patient. Members of the health care team should not assume that older patients should automatically be given a simplified regimen, or that all people want to be involved in a complex treatment regimen. The nurse plays an important role in educating the patient about the various approaches to insulin therapy. The nurse should refer the patient to a diabetes and education care specialist, certified diabetes educator (CDE), or a diabetes education center, if available, for further training and education in the insulin treatment regimens.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Conventional Regimen.</strong></span> One approach is to simplify the insulin regimen as much as possible, with the aim of avoiding the acute complications of diabetes (hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia). With this type of simplified regimen (e.g., one or more injections of a mixture of short- and intermediate-acting insulins per day), the patient should not vary meal patterns and activity levels. The simplified regimen would be appropriate for the terminally ill, the older adult who is frail and has limited self-care abilities, or patients who are completely unwilling or unable to engage in the self-management activities that are part of a more complex insulin regimen.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Intensive Regimen.</strong></span> The second approach is to use a more complex insulin regimen to achieve as much control over blood glucose levels as is safe and practical. A more complex insulin regimen allows the patient more flexibility to change the insulin doses from day to day in accordance with changes in eating and activity patterns, with stress and illness, and as needed for variations in the prevailing glucose level.</p>
<p class="indent">While intensive treatment (3 or 4 injections of insulin per day) reduces the risk of complications, not all people with diabetes are candidates for very tight control of blood glucose. The risk of severe hypoglycemia increases threefold in patients receiving intensive treatment (ADA, 2020). Patients who have received a kidney transplant because of nephropathy and chronic kidney disease should follow an intensive insulin regimen to preserve function of the new kidney.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who are not candidates include those with:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Nervous system disorders rendering them unaware of hypoglycemic episodes (e.g., those with autonomic neuropathy)</span></li>
<li><span>Recurring severe hypoglycemia</span></li>
<li><span>Irreversible diabetic complications, such as blindness or ESKD</span></li>
<li><span>Severe cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease</span></li>
<li><span>Ineffective self-care skills</span></li></ul>
<p class="h8">Complications of Insulin Therapy</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Local Allergic Reactions.</strong></span> A local allergic reaction (redness, swelling, tenderness, and induration or a 2- to 4-cm wheal) may appear at the injection site 1 to 2 hours after the administration of insulin. Reactions usually resolve in a few hours or days. If they do not resolve, another type of insulin can be prescribed (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Systemic Allergic Reactions.</strong></span> Systemic allergic reactions to insulin are rare. When they do occur, there is an immediate local skin reaction that gradually spreads into generalized urticaria (hives). These rare reactions are occasionally associated with generalized edema or anaphylaxis. The treatment is desensitization, with small doses of insulin given in gradually increasing amounts using a desensitization kit.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Insulin Lipodystrophy.</strong></span> Lipodystrophy refers to a localized reaction, in the form of either lipoatrophy or lipohypertrophy, occurring at the site of insulin injections. Lipoatrophy is the loss of subcutaneous fat; it appears as slight dimpling or more serious pitting of subcutaneous fat. The use of human insulin has almost eliminated this disfiguring complication.</p>
<p class="indent">Lipohypertrophy, the development of fibrofatty masses at the injection site, is caused by the repeated use of an injection site. If insulin is injected into scarred areas, absorption may be delayed. This is one reason that rotation of injection sites is so important. Patients should avoid injecting insulin into these areas until the hypertrophy disappears.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Resistance to Injected Insulin.</strong></span> Patients may develop insulin resistance and require large insulin doses to control symptoms of diabetes (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). In most patients with diabetes who take insulin, immune antibodies develop and bind the insulin, thereby decreasing the insulin available for use. All insulins cause some antibody production in humans.</p>
<p class="indent">Very few patients who are resistant develop high levels of antibodies. Many of these patients have a history of insulin therapy interrupted for several months or longer. Treatment consists of administering a more concentrated insulin preparation, such as U-500, which is available by special order (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). U-500 insulin is never stored with other insulin preparations due to the risk of overdose if accidentally given to the wrong patient (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Occasionally, corticosteroid therapy is needed to block the production of antibodies. This may be followed by a gradual reduction in the insulin requirement. Therefore, patients must monitor their blood for hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Morning Hyperglycemia.</strong></span> An elevated blood glucose level on arising in the morning is caused by an insufficient level of insulin, which may be caused by several factors: the dawn phenomenon, the Somogyi effect, or insulin waning. The dawn phenomenon is characterized by a relatively normal blood glucose level until approximately 3 <span class="small">AM</span>, when blood glucose levels begin to rise. The phenomenon is thought to result from nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion, which creates a greater need for insulin in the early morning hours in patients with type 1 diabetes. It must be distinguished from insulin waning (the progressive increase in blood glucose from bedtime to morning) and from the Somogyi effect (nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by rebound hyperglycemia). Insulin waning is frequently seen if the evening NPH dose is given before dinner; it is prevented by moving the evening dose of NPH insulin to bedtime.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">It may be difficult to tell from a patient&#x2019;s history what the cause is for morning hyperglycemia. To determine the cause, the patient must be awakened once or twice during the night to test blood glucose levels. Testing at bedtime, at 3 am, and on awakening provides information that can be used to make adjustments in insulin to avoid morning hyperglycemia.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#ct46-5">Chart 46-5</a> summarizes the differences among insulin waning, the dawn phenomenon, and the Somogyi effect.</p>
<p class="h8">Methods of Insulin Delivery</p>
<p class="nonindent">Methods of insulin delivery include traditional subcutaneous injections, insulin pens, jet injectors, and insulin pumps. (See later Nursing Management discussion of traditional subcutaneous injections.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Insulin Pens.</strong></span> Insulin pens use small (150- to 300-unit) prefilled insulin cartridges that are loaded into a penlike holder. A disposable needle is attached to the device for insulin injection. Insulin is delivered by dialing in a dose or pushing a button for every 1- or 2-unit increment given. People using these devices still need to insert the needle for each injection (see <a href="#ff46-3">Fig. 46-3</a>); however, they do not need to carry insulin bottles or draw up insulin before each injection. These devices are most useful for patients who need to inject only one type of insulin at a time (e.g., premeal rapid-acting insulin three times a day, bedtime NPH insulin) or who can use the premixed insulins. These pens are convenient for those who administer insulin before dinner if eating out or traveling. They are also useful for patients with impaired manual dexterity, vision, or cognitive function, which makes the use of traditional syringes difficult.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Jet Injectors.</strong></span> As an alternative to needle injections, jet injection devices deliver insulin through the skin under pressure in an extremely fine stream. These devices are more expensive and require thorough training and supervision when first used. In addition, patients should be cautioned that absorption rates, peak insulin activity, and insulin levels may be different when changing to a jet injector. (Insulin given by jet injector is usually absorbed faster.) The use of jet injectors has been associated with bruising in some patients.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Insulin Pumps.</strong></span> Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion involves the use of small, externally worn devices called insulin pumps (ADA, 2020). This technology mimics the functions of a healthy pancreas by providing automated systems that can adjust insulin delivery based on basal (background) insulin every 5 minutes. Insulin pumps contain a 3-mL syringe attached to a long (24- to 42-inch), thin, narrow-lumen tube with a needle or Teflon catheter attached to the end. The patient inserts the needle or catheter into subcutaneous tissue (usually on the abdomen) and secures it with tape or a transparent dressing. The needle or catheter is changed at least every 3 days. The pump is then worn either on the patient&#x2019;s clothing or in a pocket. Some women keep the pump tucked into the front or side of the bra. Additional accessories, such as belt, clip or pouch can be used to carry an insulin pump.</p>
<p class="indent">When an insulin pump is used, insulin is delivered by subcutaneous infusion at a basal rate that ranges from 0.25 to 2&#x00A0;units per hour depending on the device. When a meal is consumed, the patient calculates a dose of insulin to metabolize the meal by counting the total amount of carbohydrate for the meal using a predetermined insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio; for example, a ratio of 1 unit of insulin for every 15 g of carbohydrate would require 3 units for a meal with 45 g of carbohydrate. This allows flexibility of meal timing and content.</p>
<p class="indent">Possible disadvantages of insulin pumps are unexpected disruptions in the flow of insulin from the pump that may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1504" title="1504"></span>occur if the tubing or needle becomes occluded, if the supply of insulin runs out, or if the battery is depleted, increasing the risk of DKA. Effective education to produce knowledgeable patients minimizes this risk. There is the potential for infection at needle insertion sites. Hypoglycemia may occur with insulin pump therapy; however, this is usually related to the lowered blood glucose levels that many patients achieve rather than to a specific problem with the pump itself. The tight diabetes control associated with the use of an insulin pump may increase the incidence of hypoglycemia unawareness because of the very gradual decline in serum glucose level, from more than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) to less than 60&#x00A0;mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L).</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients find that wearing the pump for 24 hours each day is inconvenient. However, the pump can easily be disconnected, per patient preference, for limited periods, such as for showering, exercise, swimming, or sexual activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Candidates for the insulin pump must be willing to assess their blood glucose level several times daily with either SMBG or CGM (ADA, 2020). In addition, they must be psychologically stable and comfortable about having diabetes, because the insulin pump is often a visible sign to others and a constant reminder to patients that they have diabetes. Most important, patients using insulin pumps must have extensive education in the use of the pump and in self-management of blood glucose and insulin doses. They must work closely with a team of health care professionals who are experienced in insulin pump therapy&#x2014;specifically, a diabetologist/endocrinologist, a dietitian, and a diabetes and education specialist or CDE.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common risk of insulin pump therapy is DKA which can occur if there is an occlusion in the infusion set or tubing. Because only rapid-acting insulin is used in the pump, any interruption in the flow of insulin may rapidly cause the patient to be without insulin. The patient should be taught to administer insulin by manual injection if an insulin interruption is suspected (e.g., no response in blood glucose level after a meal bolus).</p>
<p class="indent">Many insurance companies cover the cost of pump therapy. If not, the extra expense of the pump and associated supplies may be a deterrent for some patients. Medicare covers insulin pump therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent">Insulin pumps have been used in patients with type 2 diabetes whose beta-cell function has diminished and who require insulin. Patients with a hectic lifestyle often do well with an insulin pump. There is no risk of DKA when there is an interruption of the flow of insulin in people with type 2 diabetes wearing an insulin pump.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Transplantation of Pancreatic Cells.</strong></span> Transplantation of the whole pancreas or a segment of the pancreas is being performed on a limited population (mostly patients with diabetes who are receiving a kidney transplantation simultaneously) (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3447">Aref, Zayan, Pararajasingam, et al., 2019</a>). Patients must weigh the risks of antirejection medications against the advantages of pancreas transplantation. Implantation of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells is another approach. This latter approach involves a less extensive surgical procedure and a potentially lower incidence of immunogenic problems. However, thus far, independence from exogenous insulin has been limited to 2 years after transplantation of islet cells. Results of studies of patients younger than 50 years of age with islet cell transplants using less toxic antirejection drugs have shown some promise (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Aref et al., 2019</a>). These procedures are not widely available due to a shortage of organs for transplantation.</p>
<p class="h7">Oral Antidiabetic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oral antidiabetic agents may be effective for patients who have type 2 diabetes that cannot be treated effectively with MNT and exercise alone. In the United States, oral antidiabetic agents include second-generation sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, non-sulfonylurea insulin secretogogues (meglitinides, phenylalanine derivatives), thiazolidinediones (glitazones), dipeptide peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGL-2) inhibitors (see <a href="#tt46-5">Table 46-5</a>). The thiazolidinediones are a class of oral antidiabetic medications that reduce insulin resistance in target tissues, enhancing insulin action without directly stimulating insulin secretion. Second-generation sulfonylureas and meglitinides are insulin secretagogues (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Keresztes &#x0026; Peacock-Johnson, 2019</a>). Patients must understand that oral agents are prescribed as an addition to (not a substitute for) other treatment modalities, such as MNT and exercise. The use of oral antidiabetic medications may need to be halted temporarily and insulin prescribed if hyperglycemia develops that is attributable to infection, trauma, or surgery. See later section on glycemic control in the patient who is hospitalized.</p>
<p class="indent">Because mechanisms of action vary (see <a href="#ff46-4">Fig. 46-4</a>), effects may be enhanced with the use of a multidose, or more than one medication (ADA, 2020). A combination of oral agents with insulin, usually glargine at bedtime, has also been used as a treatment for some patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin therapy may be used from the onset for newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes who are symptomatic and have high blood glucose and A1C levels (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h7">Other Pharmacologic Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Additional medications are available for use in the pharmacologic management of diabetes. These injectables are adjunct therapies, not a substitute for insulin if insulin is required to control diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent">Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of human amylin, a hormone that is secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas, is approved for treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). It is used to control hyperglycemia in adults who have not achieved acceptable levels of glucose control despite the use of insulin at mealtimes. It is used with insulin, not in place of insulin. It acts to slow the rate at which food leaves the stomach and reduces appetite (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The goal of therapy is to minimize fluctuations in daily glucose levels and provide better glucose control. Pramlintide must be injected subcutaneously 2 in from an insulin injection site (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Patients are instructed to monitor their blood glucose levels closely during the initial period of use of pramlintide.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of patients with diabetes can involve treatment of a wide variety of physiologic disorders, depending on the patient&#x2019;s health status and whether the patient is newly diagnosed or seeking care for an unrelated health problem. Glucose control in patients diagnosed with diabetes as well as those who have not been diagnosed is an important consideration in the hospital setting. Nursing management of patients with DKA and HHS and of those with diabetes as a secondary diagnosis is discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Because all patients with diabetes must master the concepts and skills necessary for long-term management and avoidance of potential complications of diabetes, a solid educational foundation is necessary for competent self-care and is an ongoing focus of nursing care.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Managing Glucose Control in the Hospital Setting</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperglycemia can prolong lengths of stay and increase infection rates and mortality; thus, nurses need to address glucose management in all hospital patients. Hyperglycemia occurs most often in patients with known diabetes (i.e., type 1, type 2, gestational) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1507" title="1507"></span>and in those newly diagnosed with diabetes or stress hyperglycemia. Nursing management of hyperglycemia in the hospital uses the following principles (ADA, 2020):</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Blood glucose targets are 140 to 180 mg/dL.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Insulin (subcutaneous or IV) is preferred to oral antidiabetic agents to manage hyperglycemia.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Hospital insulin protocols or order sets should minimize complexity, ensure adequate staff training, include standardized hypoglycemic treatment, and make guidelines available for glycemic goals and insulin dosing.</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Appropriate timing of blood glucose checks, meal consumption, and insulin dose are all crucial for glucose control and to avoid hypoglycemia.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Providing Patient Education</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetes is a chronic illness that requires a lifetime of special self-management behaviors (ADA, 2020). Because MNT, physical activity, medication, and physical and emotional stress affect diabetic control, patients must learn to balance a multitude of factors.</p>
<p class="h7">Developing a Diabetes Education Plan</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes are hospitalized for short periods or may be managed completely on an outpatient basis. Patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes are rarely hospitalized for initial care. Outpatient diabetes education and training programs have proliferated with the availability of third-party reimbursement. All encounters with patients with diabetes are opportunities for reinforcement of self-management skills, regardless of the setting.</p>
<p class="indent">Many health systems employ nurses and registered dietitians who specialize in diabetes education and management and who are certified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators as CDEs. However, because of the large number of patients with diabetes all nurses play a vital role in identifying patients with diabetes, assessing self-care skills, providing basic education, reinforcing the education provided by the specialist, and referring patients for follow-up care. Diabetes patient education programs that have been peer-reviewed by the ADA as meeting National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education can be reimbursed for education (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Davidson, Ross, &#x0026; Castor, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="CASEMSTUDYptype03pTitle" id="unfolding4"><strong>Unfolding Patient Stories: Skyler Hansen &#x2022; Part 2</strong></p>

<p class="box5text">Recall from <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> <span class="unfold"><strong>Skyler Hansen</strong></span>, a high school student recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Outline a diabetes education plan for Skyler and his parents. What are important patient education topics, resources, and methods for the nurse to consider? How would the nurse evaluate whether the patient and his family understand the education provided?</p>
<p class="CASEMSTUDYptype03pPARApIndent">Care for Skyler and other patients in a realistic virtual environment: <em><strong>vSim</strong> for Nursing</em> (<strong><a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/vSimMedicalSurgical">thepoint.lww.com/vSimMedicalSurgical</a></strong>). Practice documenting these patients&#x2019; care in DocuCare (<strong><a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/DocuCareEHR">thepoint.lww.com/DocuCareEHR</a></strong>).</p>
</div>
<p class="h8">Organizing Information</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are various strategies for organizing and prioritizing the vast amount of information that must be taught to patients with diabetes. In addition, many hospitals and outpatient diabetes centers have devised written guidelines, care plans, and documentation forms (often based on ADA guidelines) that may be used to document and evaluate education (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Davidson et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A general approach is to organize information and skills into two main categories: basic or initial, and in-depth (advanced) or continuing education.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink"><strong>Educating Patients About Basic Skills.</strong></span> Basic skills must be learned by all patients with newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes and all patients receiving insulin for the first time. Basic information that patients must know is included in <a href="#ct46-6">Chart 46-6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, emphasis is initially placed on meal planning, exercise, and weight loss if applicable. Those who are starting to take oral antidiabetic agents need to know about detecting, preventing, and treating hypoglycemia. If diabetes has gone undetected for many years, the patient may already be experiencing some chronic complications from diabetes. Therefore, for some patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, basic diabetes education must include information on preventive skills, such as foot care (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Davidson et al., 2018</a>) and eye care (e.g., planning yearly or more frequent complete [dilated eye] examinations by an ophthalmologist, understanding that retinopathy is largely asymptomatic until advanced stages).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients also need to realize that once they master the basic skills and information, diabetes education is a life-long process. Acquiring in-depth and advanced diabetes knowledge occurs both formally through programs of continuing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1508" title="1508"></span>education and informally through experience and sharing of information with other people with diabetes.</p>

Preventive measures include foot care, eye care, general hygiene (e.g., skin care, oral hygiene), and risk factor management (e.g., control of blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, weight) (ADA, 2020; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Davidson et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">More advanced continuing education may include alternative methods for insulin delivery, such as the insulin pump, CGM, and algorithms or rules for evaluating and adjusting insulin doses. The degree of advanced diabetes education to be provided depends on the patient&#x2019;s interest and ability. However, learning preventive measures (especially foot and eye care) is mandatory for early detection and treatment to reduce the occurrence of amputations and blindness in patients with diabetes.</p>
<p class="h7">Assessing Readiness to Learn</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before initiating diabetes education, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s (and family&#x2019;s) readiness to learn. When patients are first diagnosed with diabetes (or first told of their need for insulin), they often go through stages of the grieving process. These stages may include shock and denial, anger, depression, negotiation, and acceptance. The amount of time it takes for the patient and family members to work through the grieving process varies from patient to patient. They may experience helplessness, guilt, altered body image, loss of self-esteem, and concern about the future. The nurse must assess the patient&#x2019;s coping strategies and reassure the patient and family that feelings of depression and shock are normal.</p>
<p class="indent">Asking the patient and family about their major concerns or fears is an important way to learn about any misinformation that may be contributing to anxiety. Simple, direct information should be provided to dispel misconceptions. Once the patient masters basic skills, more information is provided.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are in the hospital rarely have the luxury of waiting until they feel ready to learn; short lengths of hospital stay necessitate initiation of basic skill education as early as possible. This gives the patient the opportunity to practice skills with supervision by the nurse before discharge. Follow-up in the home is often necessary for reinforcement of skills.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s social situation for factors that may influence the diabetes treatment and education plan, such as:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Low literacy level (may be evaluated while assessing for visual deficits by having the patient read from educational materials)</span></li>
<li><span>Limited financial resources or lack of health insurance</span></li>
<li><span>Presence or absence of family support</span></li>
<li><span>Typical daily schedule (the patient is asked about the timing and number of usual daily meals, work and exercise schedule, plans for travel)</span></li>
<li><span>Cognitive deficits or other disabling conditions, obtained from the patient&#x2019;s health history and physical assessment (the patient is assessed for aphasia or decreased ability to follow simple commands)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Cultural beliefs may also impact adherence to a regimen.</p>
<p class="h7">Educating Experienced Patients</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses need to annually assess the skills and self-care behaviors of patients who have had diabetes for many years (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Davidson et al., 2018</a>). Assessment of these patients must include direct observation of skills, not just the patient&#x2019;s self-report of self-care behaviors. In addition, these patients must be fully aware of preventive measures related to foot care, eye care, and risk factor management. Those experiencing long-term complications from diabetes for the first time may go through the grieving process again. Some patients may have a renewed interest in diabetes self-care in the hope of delaying further complications. Others may have guilt and depression. The patient is encouraged to discuss feelings and fears related to complications. Meanwhile, the nurse provides appropriate information regarding complications from diabetes.</p>
<p class="h7">Determining Education Methods</p>
<p class="nonindent">Maintaining flexibility with regard to education approaches is important. Providing education on skills and information in a logical sequence is not always the most helpful method for patients. For example, many patients fear self-injection. Before they learn how to prepare, purchase, store, and mix insulins, they should be taught to insert the needle and inject insulin (or practice with saline solution).</p>
<p class="indent">Various tools can be used to complement education. Many of the companies that manufacture products for diabetes self-care also provide booklets, videotapes, DVDs, or on-line materials to assist in patient education. Educational materials are also available from many sources (see the Resources section). It is important to use a variety of written handouts that match the patient&#x2019;s learning needs (including different languages, low-literacy information, and large print) and reading level and to ensure that these materials are technically accurate. Patients can continue learning about diabetes care by participating in community-based educational programs and other sources such as Web-based programs (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3449">Davidson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Educating Patients to Self-Administer Insulin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Insulin injections are self-administered into the subcutaneous tissue with the use of special insulin syringes. Basic information includes explanations of the equipment, insulins, and syringes and how to mix insulin, if necessary.</p>
<p class="h8">Storing Insulin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Whether insulin is the short- or the long-acting preparation, vials not in use, including spare vials or pens, should be refrigerated. Extremes of temperature should be avoided; insulin should not be allowed to freeze and should not be kept in direct sunlight or in a hot car. The insulin vial in use should be kept at room temperature to reduce local irritation at the injection site, which may occur if cold insulin is injected. If a vial of insulin will be used up within 1 month, it may be kept at room temperature. The patient should be instructed to always have a spare vial of the type or types of insulin used (ADA, 2020). Cloudy insulins should be thoroughly mixed by gently inverting the vial or rolling it between the hands before drawing the solution into a syringe or a pen (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The patient needs to be educated to pay attention to the expiration date on any type of insulin.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1508</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1509" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1509">p. 1509</span></div>
<p class="indent">Bottles of intermediate-acting insulin should also be inspected for flocculation, which is a frosted, whitish coating inside the bottle. This occurs most commonly with insulins that are exposed to extremes of temperature. If a frosted, adherent coating is present, some of the insulin is bound, inactive, and should not be used.</p>
<p class="h8">Selecting Syringes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Syringes must be matched with the insulin concentration (e.g., U-100). Currently, three sizes of U-100 insulin syringes are available:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>1-mL syringe, 100-unit capacity</span></li>
<li><span>0.5-mL syringe, 50-unit capacity</span></li>
<li><span>0.3-mL syringe, 30-unit capacity</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The concentration of insulin used in the United States is U-100; that is, there are 100 units per milliliter (or cubic centimeter). Small syringes allow patients who require small amounts of insulin to measure and draw up the amount of insulin accurately. There is a U-500 (500 units/mL) concentration of insulin available by special order for patients who have severe insulin resistance and require massive doses of insulin.</p>
<p class="indent">Most insulin syringes have a disposable 27- to 29-gauge needle that is approximately 0.5 in long. The smaller syringes are marked in 1-unit increments and may be easier to use for patients with visual deficits and those taking very small doses of insulin. The 1-mL syringes are marked in 1- and 2-unit increments. A small disposable insulin needle (31 gauge, 8 mm long) is available for very thin patients and children.</p>
<p class="h8">Mixing Insulins</p>
<p class="nonindent">When rapid- or short-acting insulins are to be given simultaneously with longer-acting insulins, they are usually mixed together in the same syringe; the longer-acting insulins must be mixed thoroughly before drawing into the syringe. It is important that patients prepare their insulin injections consistently from day to day.</p>
<p class="indent">There are varying opinions regarding which type of insulin (short- or longer-acting) should be drawn up into the syringe first when they are going to be mixed, but the ADA recommends that the regular insulin be drawn up first. The most important issues are that patients are consistent in technique, so as not to draw up the wrong dose in error or the wrong type of insulin, and that patients not inject one type of insulin into the bottle containing a different type of insulin. Injecting cloudy insulin into a vial of clear insulin contaminates the entire vial of clear insulin and alters its action.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who have difficulty mixing insulins, several options are available. They may use a premixed insulin, they may have prefilled syringes prepared (see <a href="#ff46-3">Fig. 46-3</a>), or they may take 2 injections. Premixed insulins are available in many different ratios of NPH insulin to regular insulin (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The ratio of 70/30 (70% NPH and 30% regular insulin in one bottle) is most common. Combinations with a ratio of 75% NPL (neutral protamine lispro) and 25% insulin lispro are also available. The appropriate initial dosage of premixed insulin must be calculated so that the ratio of NPH to regular insulin most closely approximates the separate doses needed.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who can inject insulin but who have difficulty drawing up a single or mixed dose, syringes may be prefilled with the help of home health nurses or family and friends. A 3-week supply of insulin syringes may be prepared and kept in the refrigerator but warmed to room temperature before administration. The prefilled syringes should be stored with the needle in an upright position to avoid clogging of the needle; they should be mixed thoroughly by inverting syringe several times before the insulin is injected.</p>
<p class="h8">Withdrawing Insulin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Most (if not all) of the printed materials available on insulin dose preparation instruct patients to inject air into the bottle of insulin equivalent to the number of units of insulin to be withdrawn. The rationale for this is to prevent the formation of a vacuum inside the bottle, which would make it difficult to withdraw the proper amount of insulin.</p>
<p class="h8">Selecting and Rotating the Injection Site</p>
<p class="nonindent">The four main areas for injection are the abdomen, upper arms (posterior surface), thighs (anterior surface), and hips (see <a href="#ff46-5">Fig. 46-5</a>). Insulin is absorbed faster in some areas of the body than others. The speed of absorption is greatest in the abdomen and decreases progressively in the arm, thigh, and hip, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Systematic rotation of injection sites within an anatomic area is recommended to prevent lipodystrophy (localized changes in fatty tissue). In addition, to promote consistency in insulin absorption, the patient should be encouraged to use all available injection sites within one area rather than randomly rotating sites from area to area. For example, some patients almost exclusively use the abdominal area, administering each injection 0.5 to 1 inch away from the previous injection. Another approach to rotation is always to use the same area at the same time of day. For example, patients may inject morning doses into the abdomen and evening doses into the arms or legs.</p>
<p class="indent">A few general principles apply to all rotation patterns. First, the patient should try not to use the exact same site more than once in 2 to 3 weeks. In addition, if the patient is planning to exercise, insulin should not be injected into the limb that will be exercised because this will cause the drug to be absorbed faster, which may result in hypoglycemia.</p>

<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara0"><sup><em>b</em></sup>Although some studies suggest that reusing disposable syringes may be safe, it is recommended that this be done only in the absence of poor personal hygiene, an acute concurrent illness, open wounds on the hands, or decreased resistance to infection.</p>
</div>
<p class="h8">Preparing the Skin</p>
<p class="nonindent">The use of alcohol to cleanse the skin is not necessary, but patients who have learned this technique often continue to use it. They should be cautioned to allow the skin to dry after cleansing with alcohol. If the skin is not allowed to dry before the injection, the alcohol may be carried into the tissues, resulting in a localized reddened area and a burning sensation.</p>
<p class="h8">Inserting the Needle</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are varying approaches to inserting the needle for insulin injections. The correct technique is based on the need for the insulin to be injected into the subcutaneous tissue (see <a href="#ct46-7">Chart 46-7</a>). Injection that is too deep (e.g., intramuscular) or too shallow (intradermal) may affect the rate of absorption of the insulin. For a normal or overweight person, a 90-degree angle is the best insertion angle. Aspiration (inserting the needle and then pulling back on the plunger to assess for blood being drawn into the syringe and needle in vein) is not necessary. Many patients who have been using insulin for an extended period have eliminated this step from their insulin injection routine with no apparent adverse effects. Chart&#x00A0;46-8 details how to evaluate the effectiveness of self-injection of insulin education.</p>
<p class="h8">Disposing of Syringes and Needles</p>
<p class="nonindent">Insulin syringes and pens, needles, and lancets should be disposed of according to local regulations. If community disposal programs are unavailable, used sharps should be placed in a puncture-resistant container. The patient should contact local trash authorities for instructions about proper disposal of filled containers, which should not be mixed with containers to be recycled.</p>

<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating the Patient About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">If poor glucose control or preventable complications occur, the nurse needs to assess the reasons for the patient&#x2019;s ineffective management of the treatment regimen. It should not be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1511" title="1511"></span>assumed that problems with diabetes management are related to the patient&#x2019;s decision to ignore self-management. The patient may have forgotten or may have never learned certain information, or there may be cultural or religious beliefs that interfere with adherence. The problem may be correctable simply through providing complete information and ensuring that the patient understands the information. The focus of diabetes education should be patient empowerment. Patient education must address behavior change, self-efficacy, and health beliefs.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">If knowledge deficit is not the issue, physical or emotional factors may be impairing the patient&#x2019;s ability to perform self-care skills. For example, decreased visual acuity may impair the patient&#x2019;s ability to administer insulin accurately, measure the blood glucose level, or inspect the skin and feet. In addition, decreased joint mobility (especially in older adults) or preexisting disability may impair the patient&#x2019;s ability to inspect the bottom of the feet. Denial of the diagnosis or depression may impair the patient&#x2019;s ability to carry out multiple daily self-care measures. The patient whose family, personal, or work problems may be of higher priority may benefit from assistance in establishing priorities. The nurse must also assess the patient for infection or emotional stress, which may lead to elevated blood glucose levels despite adherence to the treatment regimen.</p>
<p class="indent">The following approaches are helpful for promoting self-care management skills:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Address any underlying factors (e.g., knowledge deficit, self-care deficit, illness) that may affect control of diabetes.</p>

<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The degree to which patients interact with primary providers to obtain ongoing care depends on many factors. Age, socioeconomic level, existing complications, type of diabetes, and comorbid conditions may dictate the frequency of follow-up visits. Many patients with diabetes are seen by home health, community-based, or transitional care nurses for diabetes education, wound care, insulin preparation, or assistance with glucose monitoring. Even patients who achieve excellent glucose control and have no complications can expect to see their primary provider at least twice a year for ongoing evaluation and should receive routine nutrition updates. In addition, the nurse should remind the patient to participate in recommended health promotion activities (e.g., annual flu vaccines) and age-appropriate health screenings (e.g., pelvic examinations, mammograms).</p>
<p class="indent">Participation in support groups (in person or online) is encouraged for patients who have had diabetes for many years as well as for those who are newly diagnosed. Such participation may help the patient and family cope with changes in lifestyle that occur with the onset of diabetes and its complications. People who participate in support groups often share valuable information and experiences and learn from others. Support groups provide an opportunity for discussion of strategies to deal with diabetes and its management and to clarify and verify information with nurses or other health care professionals leading to healthier behaviors.</p>
