<p class="nonindent">When caring for patients with dermatologic disorders, the nurse obtains important information through the health history and direct observations. The nurse&#x2019;s skill in physical assessment and an understanding of the anatomy and function of the skin can ensure that deviations from normal are recognized, reported, and documented.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2575">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the health history interview, the nurse asks about use of hair and skin products, as well as any family and personal history of skin allergies; allergic reactions to food, medications, and chemicals; previous skin conditions; and skin cancer (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The health history addresses the onset, signs and symptoms, location, and duration of any pain, itching, rash, or other discomfort experienced by the patient. The names of cosmetics, soaps, shampoos, and other personal hygiene products are obtained if there have been any recent skin conditions noticed with the use of these products. The patient is questioned about nonprescription or herbal preparations that are being used. <a href="#ct55-2">Chart&#x00A0;55-2</a> lists selected questions useful in obtaining appropriate information, and <a href="#ct55-3">Chart&#x00A0;55-3</a> provides genetic factors influencing skin conditions.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2576">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the skin involves the entire skin area, including the mucous membranes, scalp, hair, and nails. The skin reflects a person&#x2019;s overall health, and alterations commonly correspond to disease in other organ systems. Inspection and palpation are techniques commonly used in examining the skin. The room must be well lighted and warm. A penlight may be used to highlight lesions. The patient completely disrobes and is adequately draped. Gloves are worn during skin examination.</p>
<p class="indent">The general appearance of the skin is assessed by observing color, temperature, moisture or dryness, skin texture (rough or smooth), lesions, vascularity, mobility, and the condition of the hair and nails. Skin turgor, possible edema, and elasticity are assessed by palpation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Skin Color</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The color gradations that occur in people with dark skin are largely determined by genetics; they may be described as light, medium, or dark. In people with dark skin, melanin is produced at a faster rate and in larger quantities than in people with light skin. Healthy dark skin has a reddish base or undertone. The buccal mucosa, tongue, lips, and nails normally are pink. The skin of exposed portions of the body, especially in sunny, warm climates, tends to be more pigmented than the rest of the body. Almost every process that occurs on the skin causes some color change. For example, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypopigmentation:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in the melanin of the skin, resulting in a loss of pigmentation">hypopigmentation</button></strong> (i.e., loss of pigmentation) may be caused by a fungal infection, eczema, or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vitiligo:&lt;/b&gt; a localized or widespread condition characterized by destruction of the melanocytes in circumscribed areas of the skin, resulting in white patches">vitiligo</button></strong> (i.e., white patches); <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hyperpigmentation:&lt;/b&gt; increase in the melanin of the skin, resulting in an increase in pigmentation">hyperpigmentation</button></strong> (i.e., increase in pigmentation) can occur after sun injury or as a result of aging. Dark pigment responds with discoloration after injury or inflammation, and patients with dark skin more often experience postinflammatory hyperpigmentation than those with lighter skin. The hyperpigmentation eventually fades but may require months to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">Changes in skin color in people with dark skin are more noticeable and may cause more concern because the discoloration is more readily visible. Because of the increased activity of melanocytes in darker skin, pigment changes can become obvious and cause great psychological discomfort. Some variation in skin pigment levels is considered normal. Examples include the pigmented crease across the bridge of the nose, some pigmented streaks in the nails, and pigmented spots on the sclera of the eye. Women often develop a dark line along the midline of the lower abdomen during pregnancy (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#tt55-1">Table&#x00A0;55-1</a> provides an overview of select color changes in people who are light and dark skinned.</p>
<p class="h7">Cyanosis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cyanosis is the bluish discoloration that results from a lack of oxygen in the blood (<a href="#ff55-3">Fig.&#x00A0;55-3</a>). It appears with shock or with respiratory or circulatory compromise. In people with light skin, cyanosis manifests as a bluish hue to the lips, fingertips, and nail beds. Other indications of decreased tissue perfusion include cold, clammy skin; a rapid, thready pulse; and rapid, shallow respirations. The conjunctivae of the eyelids are examined for pallor and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;petechiae:&lt;/b&gt; tiny capillary hemorrhages">petechiae</button></strong> (i.e., pinpoint red spots that result from blood leakage into skin) (see Chapter&#x00A0;29, Fig.&#x00A0;29-4).</p>
<p class="indent">In a person with dark skin, the skin usually assumes a grayish cast. To detect cyanosis, the areas around the mouth and lips and over the cheekbones and earlobes should be observed.</p>
<p class="h7">Ecchymosis</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ecchymosis:&lt;/b&gt; bleeding into the skin and tissue, initially evidenced by varied color (e.g., purple, black) that gradually fades to green, yellow, or brown over time">Ecchymosis</button></strong> results from blood leaking into the skin and appears as varied discoloration (e.g., purple, black) which fades to green, yellow, or brown hues over time. It is most often seen following trauma (e.g., skin being struck with a solid object, fall) (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bickley &#x0026; Szilagyi, 2017</a>; <a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). It is easier to observe in patients who have lighter skin color and may be seen more frequently in older adults due to increased skin fragility associated with collagen loss, decreased elasticity, and ultraviolet damage. The nurse should assess for unusual patterns or changes in ecchymoses that may indicate health disorders or abuse (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bickley &#x0026; Szilagyi, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Erythema</p>
<p class="nonindent">Erythema is redness of the skin caused by the dilation of capillaries. In people who are light skinned, it is easily observable. To determine possible inflammation, the skin is palpated for increased warmth and for smoothness (i.e., edema) or hardness (i.e., intracellular infiltration). Because dark skin tends to assume a purple-gray cast when an inflammatory process is present, it may be difficult to detect erythema.</p>
<p class="h7">Jaundice</p>
<p class="nonindent">Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin, is directly related to elevations in serum bilirubin and is often first observed in the sclerae and mucous membranes (see <a href="#ff55-3">Fig.&#x00A0;55-3</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Rash</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In instances of pruritus (i.e., itching), the patient is asked to indicate which areas of the body are involved. The skin is then stretched gently to decrease the reddish tone and make the rash more visible. Pointing a penlight laterally across the skin may highlight the rash, making it easier to observe. The differences in skin texture are then assessed by running the tips of the fingers lightly over the skin. The borders of the rash may be palpable. The patient&#x2019;s mouth and ears are included in the examination (rubeola, or measles, causes a red cast to appear on the ears, and skin cancers are quite common on the top of the ears). The patient&#x2019;s temperature is assessed, and the lymph nodes are palpated especially in the axillae, inguinal fold, and popliteal area (behind the knees).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Skin Lesions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Skin lesions are the most prominent characteristics of dermatologic conditions. They vary in size, shape, and cause and are classified according to their appearance and origin. Skin lesions can be described as primary or secondary. Primary lesions are the initial lesions and are characteristic of the disease itself. Secondary lesions result from changes in primary lesions resulting from external causes, such as scratching, trauma, infections, or changes caused by wound healing. Depending on the stage of development, skin lesions are further categorized by type and appearance (<a href="#tt55-2">Table&#x00A0;55-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A preliminary assessment of the eruption or lesion helps identify the type of dermatosis (i.e., abnormal skin condition) and indicates whether the lesion is primary or secondary. At the same time, the anatomic distribution of the eruption or lesion should be observed because certain diseases more regularly affect certain sites of the body and are distributed in characteristic patterns and shapes (<a href="#ff55-4">Figs. 55-4</a> and <a href="#ff55-5">55-5</a>). To determine the extent of the regional distribution, the left and right sides of the body should be compared while the color and shape of the lesions are assessed. The degree of pigmentation of the patient&#x2019;s skin may affect the appearance of a lesion. Lesions may be black, purple, or gray on dark skin and tan or red in patients with light skin. A metric ruler is used to measure the size of the lesions so that any further extension can be compared with this baseline measurement. After observation, the nurse palpates the lesions with gloves on to determine their texture, shape, and border and to see if they are soft and filled with fluid or hard and fixed to the surrounding tissue.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Assessing Vascularity and Hydration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the color of the skin has been evaluated and lesions have been inspected, an assessment of vascular changes in the skin is performed. A description of vascular changes includes location, distribution, color, size, and the presence of pulsations. Common vascular changes include petechiae, ecchymoses, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;telangiectasias:&lt;/b&gt; vascular structures; red marks on the skin caused by distention of the superficial blood vessels">telangiectasias</button></strong> (vascular structures), and angiomas (<a href="#tt55-3">Table&#x00A0;55-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Skin moisture, temperature, and texture are assessed primarily by palpation. The turgor (i.e., elasticity) of the skin, which decreases in normal aging, may be a factor in assessing the hydration status of a patient. To assess skin turgor, the skin should be gently pinched between the thumb and forefinger. The skin is observed to see how long it takes to return to baseline. People who are dehydrated or those with dry skin will display decreased skin turgor, where the skin remains tented after being pinched rather than returning to normal almost immediately. Edema is indicated when the skin appears tense and shiny, when a finger gently pressed into the skin leaves an indentation or &#x201C;pit&#x201D; (see Chapter&#x00A0;25, Fig.&#x00A0;25-2). Assessing the depth of the pit and length of time to resolution indicates the extent of edema (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bickley &#x0026; Szilagyi, 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Nails</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A brief inspection of the nails includes observation of configuration, color, and consistency. Many alterations in the nail or nail bed reflect local or systemic abnormalities in progress or resulting from past events (<a href="#ff55-6">Fig.&#x00A0;55-6</a>). Beau lines, a transverse depression in the nails, may reflect retarded growth of the nail matrix because of severe illness or, more commonly, local trauma. Ridging, hypertrophy, and other changes may also be visible because of local trauma. Paronychia, an inflammation of the skin around the nail, is usually accompanied by tenderness and erythema. Pitted surface of the nails is a definite indication of psoriasis. Spoon-shaped nails can indicate severe iron-deficiency anemia. The angle between the normal nail and its base is 160 degrees. When palpated, the nail base is usually firm. Clubbing of the nails is manifested by a straightening of the normal angle (180 degrees or greater) and softening of the nail base. The softened area feels spongelike when palpated (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bickley &#x0026; Szilagyi, 2017</a>). Clubbing can be a normal variant, but it is most often associated with pulmonary disease and can be a sign of chronic hypoxia (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Montpetit, C., &#x0026; Singh-Carlson, S. (2018). Engaging patients with radiation related skin discomfort in self-care. <em>Canadian Oncology Nursing Journal</em> = <em>Revue Canadienne de Nursing Oncologique</em>, <em>28</em>(3), 191&#x2013;200.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Radiation dermatitis is a common side effect associated with radiation treatment for breast cancer. Patients undergoing radiation treatment experience varying levels of symptom severity. Some will experience significant discomfort affecting daily life and the ability to perform routine activities. This study evaluated the experience of using InterDry Ag dressing, a moisture-wicking fabric dressing impregnated with antimicrobial silver, and its effectiveness on decreasing skin irritation in women receiving radiation treatment for a diagnosis of breast cancer.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A radiation oncology nurse (RON) affiliated with a regional cancer agency recruited participants for this descriptive study at the onset of their radiation treatment. Individuals were asked to participate if they were able to speak and read English fluently, had no allergy to silver, were receiving radiation treatment for breast cancer, and had developed a skin reaction from the radiation treatment. Skin assessments and skin care education (e.g., application of dressings, use of saline compressions and moisturizers) were provided to all participants receiving radiation. The InterDry Ag dressing was utilized in participants with moderate erythema, pruritus, or burning and evaluated during therapy using the National Cancer Institute: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (version 4.03) radiation dermatitis tool. In addition, a questionnaire to assess participants&#x2019; discomfort and ease of dressing use was administered 5 days after dressing application. Follow-up was also conducted both 1-week (via telephone) and 2-week (in-person) post radiation by the RON. Descriptive statistics were generated to assess study variables (e.g., demographics, erythema, pain, pruritus) and content analysis was conducted to synthesize responses to open-ended questions included in the survey.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Eighteen participants with a median age of 42 (range 36 to 74 years), completed the study. Breast characteristics (e.g., size, skin tone) and cancer treatment were variable. Skin assessments completed by the RON (5 days post application) noted reductions in pain reported for the chest wall and inframammary fold and improved pruritus for the axilla and chest wall. At 2 weeks post application, the majority of participants either agreed or strongly agreed that the dressing was easy to use (100%) and that it decreased pain (90%), pruritus (88%), and burning (78%); 95% of participants would recommend the dressing to others. Qualitative findings reinforced symptom improvement with use of the dressing; however, some participants noted that it was difficult to keep the dressing in place.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This small descriptive study demonstrated preliminary support for the effectiveness of and satisfaction with InterDry Ag dressing in improving the symptoms of radiation dermatitis experienced by women receiving radiation treatment for breast cancer. In addition, participants expressed feelings of safety, control over self-care problems, a sense of emotional support, and satisfaction with the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship that developed in response to ongoing assessment and follow-up. Nurses should be aware that options are available to minimize radiation-associated skin discomfort for patients with breast cancer and that regular interaction between the patient and nurse may contribute to more satisfactory and personalized cancer care. However, experimental studies that include larger, more diverse samples and collect data using valid and reliable scales over time are necessary to provide stronger evidence of the benefits of the InterDry Ag dressing.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Hair</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The hair assessment is carried out by inspection and palpation. Gloves are worn by the examiner, and the examination room should be well lighted. The hair is separated so that the condition of the skin underneath can be easily seen. The examiner notes the color, texture, and distribution of hair shafts. The wooden end of a cotton swab can be used to make small parts in the hair so that the scalp can be inspected. Any abnormal lesions, evidence of itching, inflammation, scaling, or signs of infestation (i.e., lice or mites) are documented.</p>
<p class="h7">Color and Texture</p>
<p class="nonindent">Natural hair color ranges from white to black. Hair begins to turn gray or white with age, when loss of melanin in the hair shaft becomes apparent. Loss of melanin in hair can occur at a younger age and may be due to heredity or genetic traits. The person with albinism (i.e., partial or complete absence of pigmentation) has a genetic predisposition to white hair from birth. The natural state of the hair can be altered by using hair dyes, bleaches, and curling or relaxing products. The use of these products has varying impact on hair, depending on its natural characteristics. For example, the use of straightening chemicals on the hair of most people can cause extensive breakage and hair loss (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Bobonich &#x0026; Nolen, 2014</a>; <a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3983">Richardson, Agidi, Eaddy, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The texture of scalp hair ranges from fine to coarse, silky to brittle, oily to dry, and shiny to dull, and hair can be straight, curly, or kinky. Dry, brittle hair may result from the overuse of hair dyes, hair dryers, and curling irons or from endocrine disorders, such as thyroid dysfunction. Oily hair is usually caused by increased secretion from the sebaceous glands close to the scalp. If the patient reports a recent change in hair texture, the underlying reason is pursued; the alteration may arise simply from the overuse of commercial hair products or from changing to a new shampoo.</p>
<p class="h7">Distribution</p>
<p class="nonindent">Body hair distribution varies with location. Hair over most of the body is fine, except in the axillae and pubic areas, where it is coarse. Pubic hair, which develops at puberty, forms a diamond shape extending up to the umbilicus in cisgender boys and men. Cisgender female pubic hair resembles an inverted triangle. If the pattern found is more characteristic of the opposite gender, it may indicate an endocrine disorder and further investigation is in order. Racial differences in hair are expected, such as straight hair in people of Asian descent and curly, coarse hair in people of African descent.</p>
<p class="indent">Men tend to have more body and facial hair than women. Alopecia can occur over the entire body or be localized to a specific area. Scalp hair loss may be patchy or may range from generalized thinning to total baldness. When assessing scalp hair loss, it is important to investigate the underlying cause with the patient. Patchy hair loss may be from habitual hair pulling or twisting; excessive traction on the hair (e.g., braiding too tightly); excessive use of dyes, straighteners, and oils; chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide); bacterial or fungal infection; or moles or lesions on the scalp. Well-defined patches of localized hair loss generally indicate the condition called <em>alopecia areata.</em> The precise mechanism is unknown but may be triggered by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Regrowth in most cases is spontaneous and occurs in 1 to 3 months, though in some rarer patterns, the hair loss is recurrent or even permanent (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Habif et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hair Loss</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common cause of male pattern hair loss or baldness is androgenic alopecia, which affects more than half of the male population and is believed to be related to heredity, aging, and androgen (male hormone) levels. Androgen is necessary for male pattern hair loss to develop. The pattern of hair loss begins with receding of the hairline in the frontal temporal area and may progress to gradual thinning and complete loss of hair over the top of the scalp and crown. The typical pattern of male hair loss is illustrated in <a href="#ff55-7">Figure&#x00A0;55-7</a>A. Although androgenic alopecia is considered a male disorder, millions of women experience female pattern hair loss, which is typically not seen with other signs of hyperandrogenism. For women complete baldness is rare; the typical pattern of hair loss is seen on the vertex scalp, sparing the frontal area (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Nicol, 2016</a>) (<a href="#ff55-7">Fig.&#x00A0;55-7</a>B).</p>

<p class="h7">Other Changes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Male pattern hair distribution may be seen in some women at the time of menopause, when the hormone estrogen is no longer produced by the ovaries. In women with hirsutism, excessive hair may grow on the face, chest, shoulders, and pubic area. If menopause is ruled out as the underlying cause, other hormonal changes related to pituitary or adrenal dysfunction must be investigated.</p>
<p class="indent">Because patients with skin conditions may be viewed negatively by others, these patients may experience psychological distress and avoid interactions and intimacy. Skin conditions can lead to isolation, job loss, and economic hardship as well as poor self-esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">Some conditions may lead to feelings of depression, frustration, self-consciousness, poor self-image, and rejection. Itching and skin irritation (features of many skin diseases) may be constant sources of physical distress. These discomforts may result in loss of sleep, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, all of which reinforce the general distress and fatigue that frequently accompany skin disorders.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients experiencing physical and psychological discomforts, the nurse needs to provide understanding, explanations of the problem, appropriate education related to treatment, nursing support, and encouragement. It is imperative to overcome any aversion that may be felt when caring for patients with unattractive skin disorders. The nurse should show no sign of hesitancy when approaching patients with skin disorders. Such hesitancy only reinforces the psychological trauma of the disorder.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2577">Skin Consequences of Select Systemic Diseases</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Diabetes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because diabetes causes changes in circulation and cell nutrition, it can have a great impact on skin status. Some of the more common skin conditions encountered in diabetes are discussed in this section. Further information can be found in <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Diabetic Dermopathy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetic dermopathy (shin spots or pigmented pretibial papules) is a frequent occurrence in people with diabetes. These lesions are found most often on the lower anterior legs. They are thought to be caused by diabetes-associated changes in the small vessels that supply the skin and trauma. Each cluster starts as dull red papules that slowly coalesce to brownish atrophic patches (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Nicol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Stasis Dermatitis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Stasis dermatitis is an eczematous eruption that occurs on the lower legs of patients with venous insufficiency. It is very common in patients with diabetes. Large vessels are damaged, compromising circulation to the lower arms and legs. The skin suffers from lack of nutrients, becoming very dry and fragile. Minor injuries heal slowly, and ulcers form easily. It initially presents with variable erythema and scale and pruritus. When chronic, it leads to permanent changes in skin color, hyper- or hypopigmentation, and either fragile or thicker skin texture (fibrosis).</p>
<p class="h7">Skin Infections</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bacterial infections may appear as small pimples around hair follicles (i.e., folliculitis). The most frequently affected sites include the lower legs, lower abdomen, and buttocks. Sometimes, these lesions enlarge to become furuncles or carbuncles. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1813" title="1813"></span>Furuncles begin in a hair follicle, progressively enlarging and invading deeper into tissue to form an abscess. Carbuncles are formed by multiple contiguous lesions (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Habif et al., 2018</a>). The skin of patients with diabetes is prone to bacterial and fungal infections. If the blood glucose level is not well controlled, these infections may be very slow to heal.</p>
<p class="indent">Fungal infections are quite common in areas that remain moist (under breasts, upper thighs, in axillae). <em>Candida</em> (i.e., yeast) infections appear beefy red and often have small pustules around the border of the area, with the skin appearing moist and raw.</p>
<p class="indent">Dermatophyte infections are dry and only minimally red, with more scale. Common sites are the toenails and feet.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses must be alert to the signs of these common infections. If necessary, they should bring them to the attention of the patient&#x2019;s primary provider and help the patient or family learn basic skin maintenance techniques.</p>
<p class="h7">Leg and Foot Ulcers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because of changes in peripheral nerves, patients with diabetes do not always sense minor injuries to the lower legs and feet. Infections begin and, if untreated, may lead to ulcerations. Ulcerations are often not noticed and become quite large before being treated. Ulcerations unresponsive to treatment are a leading cause of diabetic foot and leg amputations (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3980">Johnson, Osburne, Rispoli, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Human Immune Deficiency Virus Disease</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cutaneous signs may be the first manifestation of human immune deficiency virus (HIV), appearing in more than 90% of people who are HIV infected as immune function deteriorates. These skin signs correlate with low CD4<sup>+</sup> counts. Some disorders such as Kaposi sarcoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, facial molluscum contagiosum, and oral candidiasis may suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> counts are less than 200 to 300 cells/mcL. Skin infections, both bacterial and viral, are common and will appear more severe than expected. Acute flare of chronic conditions such as seborrhea or acne may indicate a new infection. Being sensitive to these changes can alert the nurse so that early interventions can be initiated (<a href="c55-sec03.xhtml#bib3992">Schwartz, 2019</a>).</p>
