<h4 class="h4" id="s2051">Microvascular Complications</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetic microvascular disease (or microangiopathy) is characterized by capillary basement membrane thickening. The basement membrane surrounds the endothelial cells of the capillary. Researchers believe that increased blood glucose levels react through a series of biochemical responses to thicken the basement membrane to several times its normal thickness. Two areas affected by these changes are the retina and the kidneys (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2052">Diabetic Retinopathy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among people between 20 and 74 years of age in the United States; it occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">People with diabetes are subject to many visual complications (see <a href="#tt46-7">Table 46-7</a>). The pathology referred to as diabetic retinopathy is caused by changes in the small blood vessels in the retina, which is the area of the eye that receives images and sends information about the images to the brain (see Fig.&#x00A0;46-7). The retina is richly supplied with blood vessels of all kinds: small arteries and veins, arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Retinopathy has three main stages: nonproliferative (background), preproliferative, and proliferative.</p>
<p class="indent">Almost all patients with type 1 diabetes and the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes have some degree of retinopathy after 20 years (ADA, 2020). Changes in the microvasculature include microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhage, hard exudates, and focal capillary closure. Although most patients do not develop visual impairment, it can be devastating if it occurs. A complication of nonproliferative retinopathy&#x2014;macular edema&#x2014;occurs in approximately 10% of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and may lead to visual distortion and loss of central vision (ADA, 2020).</p>

<p class="indent">An advanced form of background retinopathy&#x2014;preproliferative retinopathy&#x2014;is considered to be a precursor to the more serious proliferative retinopathy. In preproliferative retinopathy, there are more widespread vascular changes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1521" title="1521"></span>and loss of nerve fibers. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that 10% to 50% of patients with preproliferative retinopathy will develop proliferative retinopathy within a short time (possibly as little as 1 year). As with background retinopathy, if visual changes occur during the preproliferative stage, they are usually caused by macular edema.</p>
<p class="indent">Proliferative retinopathy represents the greatest threat to vision and is characterized by the proliferation of new blood vessels growing from the retina into the vitreous. These new vessels are prone to bleeding. The visual loss associated with proliferative retinopathy is caused by this vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or both. The vitreous is normally clear, allowing light to be transmitted to the retina. When there is a hemorrhage, the vitreous becomes clouded and cannot transmit light, resulting in loss of vision. Another consequence of vitreous hemorrhage is that resorption of the blood in the vitreous leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue. This scar tissue may place traction on the retina, resulting in retinal detachment and subsequent visual loss.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2053">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Retinopathy is a painless process. In non- and preproliferative retinopathy, blurry vision secondary to macular edema occurs in some patients, although many patients are asymptomatic. Even patients with a significant degree of proliferative retinopathy and some hemorrhaging may not experience major visual changes. However, symptoms indicative of hemorrhaging include floaters or cobwebs in the visual field, sudden visual changes including spotty or hazy vision, or complete loss of vision.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2054">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis is by direct visualization of the retina through dilated pupils with an ophthalmoscope or with a technique known as fluorescein angiography. Fluorescein angiography can document the type and activity of the retinopathy. Dye is injected into an arm vein and is carried to various parts of the body through the blood, but especially through the vessels of the retina of the eye. This technique allows an ophthalmologist, using special instruments, to see the retinal vessels in bright detail and gives useful information that cannot be obtained with just an ophthalmoscope.</p>
<p class="indent">Side effects of this diagnostic procedure may include nausea during the dye injection; yellowish, fluorescent discoloration of the skin and urine lasting 12 to 24 hours; and occasionally allergic reactions, usually manifested by hives or itching. However, the diagnostic procedure is generally safe.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2055">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The first focus of management of retinopathy is on primary and secondary prevention. The DCCT study (1993) demonstrated that in patients without preexisting retinopathy, maintenance of blood glucose to a normal or near-normal level in type 1 diabetes through intensive insulin therapy and patient education decreased the risk of retinopathy by 76%, compared with conventional therapy. The progression of retinopathy was decreased by 54% in patients with very mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy at the time of initiation of treatment. Additional research demonstrated similar results in patients with type 2 diabetes (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3445">Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Follow-On [ACCORDIAN] Eye Study Group, 2016</a>). Thus, control of blood glucose levels in patients with both types of diabetes reduces the risk of retinopathy as well (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Other strategies that may slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy include control of hypertension, control of blood glucose, and cessation of smoking.</p>
<p class="indent">For advanced cases of diabetic retinopathy, the main treatment is argon laser photocoagulation. The laser treatment destroys leaking blood vessels and areas of neovascularization. For patients who are at increased risk for hemorrhage, panretinal photocoagulation may significantly reduce the rate of progression to blindness. Panretinal photocoagulation involves the systematic application of multiple (more than 1000) laser burns throughout the retina (except in the macular region). This stops the widespread growth of new vessels and hemorrhaging of damaged vessels. The role of &#x201C;mild&#x201D; panretinal photocoagulation (with only one third to one half as many laser burns) in the early stages of proliferative retinopathy or in patients with preproliferative changes is being investigated. For patients with macular edema, focal photocoagulation is used to apply smaller laser burns to specific areas of microaneurysms in the macular region. This may reduce the rate of visual loss from macular edema (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Photocoagulation treatments are usually performed on an outpatient basis, and most patients can return to their usual activities by the next day. Limitations may be placed on activities involving weight bearing or bearing down. In most cases, the treatment does not cause intense pain, although patients may report varying degrees of discomfort such as a headache. Usually, an anesthetic eye drop is all that is needed during the treatment. A few patients may experience slight visual loss, loss of peripheral vision, or impairments in adaptation to the dark. However, the risk of slight visual changes from the laser treatment itself is much less than the potential for loss of vision from progression of retinopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">A major hemorrhage into the vitreous may occur, with the vitreous fluid becoming mixed with blood, preventing light from passing through the eye; this can cause blindness. A vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which vitreous humor filled with blood or fibrous tissue is removed with a special drill-like instrument and replaced with saline or another liquid. A vitrectomy is performed for patients who already have visual loss and in whom the vitreous hemorrhage has not cleared on its own after 6 months. The purpose is to restore useful vision; recovery to near-normal vision is not usually expected.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2056">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of patients with diabetic retinopathy or other eye disorders involves implementing the individual plan of care and providing patient education. Education focuses on prevention through regular ophthalmologic examinations, blood glucose control, and self-management of eye care regimens. The effectiveness of early diagnosis and prompt treatment is emphasized in educating the patient and family.</p>
<p class="indent">If vision loss occurs, nursing care must also address the patient&#x2019;s adjustment to impaired vision and the use of adaptive devices for diabetes self-care as well as activities of daily living. See <a href="c58.xhtml">Chapter 58</a> for discussion of nursing care for patients with low vision and blindness.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because the course of the retinopathy may be long and stressful, patient education is essential. In educating and counseling patients, it is important to stress the following:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Retinopathy may appear after many years of diabetes, and its appearance does not necessarily mean that the diabetes is on a downhill course.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>The odds for maintaining vision are in the patient&#x2019;s favor, especially with adequate control of glucose levels and blood pressure.</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Frequent eye examinations allow for the detection and prompt treatment of retinopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">A patient&#x2019;s response to vision loss depends on personality, self-concept, and coping mechanisms. Acceptance of blindness occurs in stages; some patients may learn to accept blindness in a rather short period, and others may never do so. An important issue in educating patients is that several complications of diabetes may occur simultaneously. For example, a patient who is blind due to diabetic retinopathy may also have peripheral neuropathy and may experience impairment of manual dexterity and tactile sensation, or kidney failure. This can be devastating to the patient and family. Psychological counseling may be warranted. To prevent further losses, glycemic control remains a priority.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The importance of careful diabetes management is emphasized as one means of slowing the progression of visual changes. The patient is reminded of the need to see an ophthalmologist regularly. If eye changes are progressive and unrelenting, the patient should be prepared for inevitable blindness. Therefore, consideration is given to making referrals for educating the patient in Braille and for training the patient with guide (i.e., service) dogs. Referral to state agencies should be made to ensure that the patient receives services for the blind. Family members are also taught how to assist the patient to remain as independent as possible despite decreasing visual acuity.</p>
<p class="indent">Referral for home care may be indicated for some patients, particularly those who live alone, those who are not coping well, and those who have other health problems or complications of diabetes that may interfere with their ability to perform self-care. During home visits, the nurse can assess the patient&#x2019;s home environment and their ability to manage diabetes despite visual impairments. See <a href="c58.xhtml">Chapter 58</a> for a detailed discussion of medical management and nursing care for patients with visual disturbances.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2057">Nephropathy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nephropathy, or kidney disease secondary to diabetic microvascular changes in the kidney, is a common complication of diabetes (ADA, 2020). In the United States each year, people with diabetes account for almost 50% of new cases of ESKD, and about 25% of those require dialysis or transplantation. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 or types 2 diabetes develop nephropathy, but fewer of those with type 2 diabetes progress to ESKD. Native American, Latino, African American, Asian American, and Pacific Island people with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk for ESKD than non-Latino Whites (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with type 1 diabetes frequently show initial signs of kidney disease after 10 to 15 years, while patients with type 2 diabetes tend to develop kidney disease within 10 years after the diagnosis of diabetes. Many patients with type 2 diabetes have had diabetes for many years before the diabetes is diagnosed and treated. Therefore, they may have evidence of nephropathy at the time of diagnosis (ADA, 2020). If blood glucose levels are elevated consistently for a significant period of time, the kidney&#x2019;s filtration mechanism is stressed, allowing blood proteins to leak into the urine. As a result, the pressure in the blood vessels of the kidney increases. It is thought that this elevated pressure serves as the stimulus for the development of nephropathy. Various medications and diets are being tested to prevent these complications.</p>
<p class="indent">The DCCT (1993) results showed that intensive treatment for type 1 diabetes with a goal of achieving a glycolated hemoglobin level as close to the nondiabetic range as possible reduced the occurrence of early signs of nephropathy. Similarly, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group (UKPDS, 1998) demonstrated a reduced incidence of overt nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes who controlled their blood glucose levels.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2058">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most of the signs and symptoms of kidney dysfunction in patients with diabetes are similar to those seen in patients without diabetes (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>). In addition, as kidney failure progresses, the catabolism (breakdown) of both exogenous and endogenous insulin decreases, and frequent hypoglycemic episodes may result. Insulin needs change as a result of changes in the catabolism of insulin, changes in diet related to the treatment of nephropathy, and changes in insulin clearance that occur with decreased kidney function.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2059">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Albumin is one of the most important blood proteins that leak into the urine. Although small amounts may leak undetected for years, its leakage into the urine is among the earliest signs that can be detected. Clinical nephropathy eventually develops in more than 85% of people with microalbuminuria but in fewer than 5% of people without microalbuminuria. The urine should be checked annually for the presence of microalbumin. If the microalbuminuria exceeds 30 mg/24 hours on two consecutive random urine tests, a 24-hour urine sample should be obtained and tested. If results are positive, treatment is indicated (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, tests for serum creatinine and BUN levels should be conducted annually. Diagnostic testing for cardiac or other systemic disorders may also be required with progression of other complications, and caution is indicated if contrast agents are used with these tests. Contrast agents and dyes used for some diagnostic tests may not be easily cleared by the damaged kidney, and the potential benefits of these diagnostic tests must be weighed against their potential risks.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypertension often develops in patients (with and without diabetes) who are in the early stages of kidney disease. However, hypertension is the most common complication in all people with diabetes (ADA, 2020). Therefore, this symptom <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1523" title="1523"></span>may or may not be due to kidney disease; other diagnostic criteria must also be present.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2060">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to achieving and maintaining near-normal blood glucose levels, management for all patients with diabetes should include careful attention to the following:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Control of hypertension (the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, such as captopril), because control of hypertension may also decrease or delay the onset of early proteinuria</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Prevention or vigorous treatment of urinary tract infections</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast dye</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Adjustment of medications as kidney function changes</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Low-sodium diet</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Low-protein diet</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient has already developed microalbuminuria with levels that exceed 30 mg/24 hours on two consecutive tests, an ACE inhibitor should be prescribed. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce microalbuminuria, thereby protecting the kidney. Alternatively, angiotensin receptor&#x2013;blocking agents may be prescribed. This preventive strategy should be part of the standard of care for all people with diabetes (ADA, 2020). Carefully designed low-protein diets also appear to reverse early leakage of small amounts of protein from the kidney.</p>
<p class="indent">In chronic or ESKD, two types of treatment are available: dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) and transplantation from a relative or a deceased donor. Hemodialysis for patients with diabetes is similar to that for patients without the disease (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>). Because hemodialysis creates additional stress on patients with cardiovascular disease, it may not be appropriate for some patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is being used by patients with diabetes, mainly because of the independence it allows. In addition, insulin can be mixed into the dialysate, which may result in better blood glucose control and end the need for insulin injections. Some patients may require higher doses of insulin because the dialysate contains glucose. Major risks of peritoneal dialysis are infection and peritonitis. The mortality rate for patients with diabetes undergoing dialysis is higher than that for patients without diabetes undergoing dialysis and is closely related to the severity of cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Kidney disease is frequently accompanied by advancing retinopathy that may require laser treatments and surgery. Severe hypertension also worsens eye disease because of the additional stress it places on the blood vessels. Patients being treated with hemodialysis who require eye surgery may be changed to peritoneal dialysis and have their hypertension aggressively controlled for several weeks before surgery to prevent bleeding and damage to the retina. The rationale for this change is that hemodialysis requires anticoagulant agents that can increase the risk of bleeding after the surgery, and peritoneal dialysis minimizes pressure changes in the eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">In medical centers performing large numbers of transplantations, the chances are 75% to 80% that the transplanted kidney will continue to function in patients with diabetes for at least 5 years. Like the original kidneys, transplanted kidneys can eventually be damaged if blood glucose levels are consistently high after the transplantation. Therefore, monitoring blood glucose levels frequently and adjusting insulin levels in patients with diabetes are essential for long-term success of kidney transplantation. Optimal treatment is a simultaneous kidney and pancreatic transplantation (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Aref et al., 2019</a>).</p>
