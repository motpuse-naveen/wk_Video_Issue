<h4 class="h4" id="s2318">Ectopic Pregnancy</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of ectopic pregnancy and the risk of death due to ectopic pregnancy are decreasing. However, ectopic pregnancy remains the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester (ACOG, 2018). Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum (a blastocyst) becomes implanted on any tissue other than the uterine lining, most commonly along the fallopian tube (ACOG, 2018) (see <a href="#ff50-7">Fig.&#x00A0;50-7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Possible causes of ectopic pregnancy include salpingitis, peritubal adhesions (after pelvic infection, endometriosis, appendicitis), structural abnormalities of the fallopian tube, previous ectopic pregnancy, previous tubal surgery, multiple previous induced abortions, and tumors that distort the tube (ACOG, 2018). Additional risk factors include use of tobacco products, IUD use, history of PID, and use of fertility drugs to induce ovulation (ACOG, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Risk factors are important, but all women need to be educated about early treatment and have a high index of suspicion in the case of a period that does not seem normal, the presence of pain, or pain with a suspected pregnancy. Women may have fatal hemorrhage with ruptured ectopic pregnancies if they delay seeking attention or if their primary providers are not alert to the possibility of this diagnosis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2319">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms vary depending on whether tubal rupture has occurred. Delay in menstruation from 1 to 2 weeks followed by slight bleeding (spotting) or a report of a slightly abnormal period suggests the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy. Symptoms may begin late, with vague soreness on the affected side (probably due to uterine contractions and distention of the tube), and may proceed to sharp, colicky pain. Most patients experience some pelvic or abdominal pain and some spotting or bleeding. Gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, or lightheadedness may occur. Patients may think the abnormal bleeding is a menstrual period, especially if a recent period occurred and was normal.</p>
<p class="indent">If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, the tube becomes more and more distended and can rupture if the ectopic pregnancy remains undetected for 4 to 6 weeks or longer after conception. When the tube ruptures, the ovum is discharged into the abdominal cavity, and the woman experiences agonizing pain, dizziness, faintness, and nausea and vomiting due to the peritoneal reaction to blood escaping from the tube. Dyspnea and symptoms of shock may occur, and the signs of hemorrhage&#x2014;rapid and thready pulse, decreased blood pressure, subnormal temperature, restlessness, pallor, and sweating&#x2014;are evident. Later, the pain becomes generalized in the abdomen and radiates to the shoulder and neck because of accumulating intraperitoneal blood that irritates the diaphragm.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2320">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ectopic pregnancies must be diagnosed promptly to prevent life-threatening hemorrhage, which is the major complication of rupture. During vaginal examination, a large mass of clotted blood that has collected in the pelvis behind the uterus or a tender adnexal mass may be palpable, although there are often no abnormal findings. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the patient is evaluated by sonography and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. Serial hCG tests may be needed (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Tulandi, 2019</a>). The levels of hCG (the diagnostic hormone of pregnancy) double in early normal pregnancies every 3 days but are reduced in abnormal or ectopic pregnancies. A less-than-normal increase is cause for suspicion. Transvaginal ultrasound, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1670" title="1670"></span>the usual method of diagnosis, can detect a pregnancy between 5 and 6 weeks from the time of the last menstrual period. Detectable fetal heart movement outside the uterus on ultrasound is firm evidence of an ectopic pregnancy.</p>
<p class="indent">Occasionally, the clinical picture makes the diagnosis relatively easy. However, when the clinical signs and symptoms are inconclusive, laparoscopy may be required for definitive diagnosis (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Tulandi, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2321">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When surgery is performed early, almost all patients recover rapidly; if tubal rupture occurs, mortality increases. The type of surgery is determined by the size and extent of local tubal damage. Resection of the involved fallopian tube with end-to-end anastomosis may be effective. Some surgeons attempt to salvage the tube with a salpingotomy, which involves opening and evacuating the tube and controlling bleeding. More extensive surgery includes salpingectomy (removing the tube alone) or salpingo-oophorectomy (removing the tube and ovary).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Another option is the use of methotrexate without surgery (ACOG, 2018). Because methotrexate stops the pregnancy from progressing by interfering with DNA synthesis and the multiplication of cells, it interrupts early, small, unruptured ectopic pregnancies. The patient must be hemodynamically stable; have no active renal or hepatic disease; have no evidence of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia; and have a very small, unruptured ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound. Other indications may include no fetal cardiac activity and no active abdominal bleeding. Methotrexate is occasionally used to eliminate residual ectopic pregnancy tissue following a laparoscopy (ACOG, 2018).</p>

<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse41"><strong>The Patient with an Ectopic Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The health history includes the menstrual pattern and any (even slight) bleeding since the last menstrual period. The nurse elicits the patient&#x2019;s description of pain and its location. The nurse asks the patient whether any sharp, colicky pains have occurred and whether pain radiates to the shoulder and neck (possibly caused by rupture and pressure on the diaphragm).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, the nurse monitors vital signs, level of consciousness, and the nature and amount of vaginal bleeding. If possible, the nurse assesses how the patient is coping with the abnormal pregnancy and likely loss.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with the progression of the ectopic pregnancy</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Grief associated with the loss of pregnancy and anticipatory effect on future pregnancies</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge associated with the treatment and effect on future pregnancies</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hemorrhage</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hemorrhagic shock</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals may include relief of pain; acceptance and resolution of grief and pregnancy loss; increased knowledge about ectopic pregnancy, its treatment, and its outcome; and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The abdominal pain associated with ectopic pregnancy may be described as cramping or severe continuous pain. If the patient is to have surgery, preanesthetic medications may provide pain relief. Postoperatively, analgesic agents are given liberally; this promotes early ambulation and enables the patient to cough and take deep breaths.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>S<small>UPPORTING THE</small> G<small>RIEVING</small> P<small>ROCESS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients experience varying levels of distress. If the pregnancy was desired, loss may or may not be expressed verbally by the patient and her partner. The impact may not be fully realized until much later. The nurse should be available to listen and provide support. The patient&#x2019;s partner, if appropriate, should participate in this process. Even if the pregnancy was unintended, a loss has been experienced, and a grief reaction may occur.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications of ectopic pregnancy are hemorrhage and shock. Careful assessment is essential to detect the development of these complications. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, level of consciousness, amount of bleeding, and intake and output provide information about the possibility of hemorrhage and the need to prepare for IV therapy. Bed rest is indicated. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and blood gases are monitored to assess hematologic status and adequacy of tissue perfusion. Significant deviations in these laboratory values are reported immediately, and the patient is prepared for possible surgery. Blood component therapy may be required if blood loss has been rapid and extensive. If hypovolemic shock occurs, the treatment is directed toward reestablishing tissue perfusion and adequate blood volume. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for a discussion of the IV fluids and medications used in treating shock.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse has an important role in prevention by being alert to patients with abnormal bleeding who may be at risk for an ectopic pregnancy and referring them immediately for care. It is necessary to keep a high index of suspicion in daily practice when a woman of childbearing age, particularly one who is not using an effective method of contraception consistently, reports abdominal discomfort or abnormal bleeding.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> If the patient has experienced life-threatening hemorrhage and shock, these complications are addressed and treated before education can begin. At this time, the patient&#x2019;s and the nurse&#x2019;s attention is focused on the crisis, not on learning. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1671" title="1671"></span>Once hemodynamically stable, the patient begins to ask questions about what happened and why certain procedures were performed. Procedures are explained in terms that are understandable to a patient who is distressed and apprehensive. The patient&#x2019;s partner is included in education when possible. After the patient recovers from postoperative discomfort, it may be more appropriate to address any questions and concerns that she and her partner have, including the effect of this pregnancy or its treatment on future pregnancies. The patient should be advised that ectopic pregnancies may recur. The patient is educated about possible complications and instructed to report early signs and symptoms. It is important to review signs and symptoms with the patient and instruct her to report an abnormal menstrual period promptly.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Because of the risk of subsequent ectopic pregnancies, the patient is advised to seek preconception counseling before considering future pregnancies and to seek early prenatal care. Follow-up contact allows the nurse to answer questions and clarify information for the patient and her partner.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
