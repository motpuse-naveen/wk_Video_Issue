<h4 class="h4" id="s2778">Refractive Surgeries</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Refractive surgeries are elective procedures performed to correct refractive errors (myopia or hyperopia) and astigmatism by reshaping the cornea (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4181">Gomel, Negari, Frucht-Pery, et al., 2018</a>). Laser vision correction alters the major optical function of the eye and carries risks. Refractive surgery does not alter the normal aging process of the eye. If the reason for the procedure is to meet vision requirements for the patient&#x2019;s occupation, the results must satisfy both the patient and the employer. Precise visual outcome cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="indent">The corneal structure must be normal, and the refractive error must be stable. The patient is required to discontinue using contact lenses for a period before the procedure (2 to 3 weeks for soft lenses and 4 weeks for hard lenses). Patients with conditions that are likely to adversely affect corneal wound healing (e.g., corticosteroid use, immunosuppression, elevated IOP) are not good candidates for the procedure. Any superficial eye disease must be diagnosed and fully treated before a refractive procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient satisfaction is the ultimate goal; therefore, patient education and counseling about potential risks, complications, and postoperative follow-up are critical. Minimal postoperative care includes topical corticosteroid or NSAID and antibiotic drops.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2779">Laser Vision Correction Photorefractive Keratectomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is used to treat myopia and hyperopia with or without astigmatism (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Gomel et al., 2018</a>). The excimer laser is applied directly to the cornea according to carefully calculated measurements. For myopia, the relative curvature is decreased; for hyperopia, the relative curvature is increased. A bandage contact lens is placed over the cornea to promote epithelial healing and reduce pain, which is similar to that of a severe corneal abrasion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">LASIK involves flattening the anterior curvature of the cornea by removing a stromal lamella or layer. The surgeon creates a corneal flap with a microkeratome, which is an automatic corneal shaper. The surgeon retracts a flap of corneal tissue less than one third the thickness of a human hair to access the corneal stroma and then uses the excimer laser on the stromal bed to reshape the cornea according to calculated measurements (see <a href="#ff58-9">Fig. 58-9</a>). Data are insufficient to determine whether LASIK or PRK is better at correcting nearsightedness (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Gomel et al., 2018</a>). There are few adverse outcomes of either procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Perioperative Complications</h6>
<p class="h7">Surgically Induced Abnormalities</p>
<p class="nonindent">Corneal surface irregularities can occur after LASIK treatment. These include central islands (central areas of stiffness or elevation), decentered ablations resulting from misalignment of the laser treatment or from involuntary eye movement during laser treatment, and forms of irregular astigmatism. Symptoms of central islands and decentered ablations include monocular diplopia or ghost images, halos, glare, and decreased visual acuity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2780">Phakic Intraocular Lenses</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Increasingly, phakic IOL implantation has been used for patients with moderate to severe myopia (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Igarashi, 2019</a>). Phakic IOLs may be used in either the anterior or posterior chamber. The implantation of such devices is reversible because the natural lens is left in place and the normal architecture of the cornea is preserved. This procedure provides more predictable refractive results than procedures that alter the corneal curvature, is safer, and has higher patient satisfaction scores (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Igarashi, 2019</a>). Potential complications include cataract, iritis or uveitis, endothelial cell loss, and increased IOP.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2781">Conductive Keratoplasty</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Another innovation in refractive surgery for the correction of low to mild hyperopia uses the principles of thermal keratoplasty by applying radiofrequency current to the peripheral cornea using a thin, handheld probe. It does not involve the removal of cornea tissue.</p>
