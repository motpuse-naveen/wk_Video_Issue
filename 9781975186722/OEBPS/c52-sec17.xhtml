<h4 class="h4" id="s2475">Reconstructive Procedures After Mastectomy</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Breast reconstruction can provide a significant psychological benefit for women who are already struggling with the emotional distress of losing a breast. A consultation with a plastic surgeon can help the patient understand procedures for which she is a candidate and the pros and cons of each. Factors to consider include body size and shape, comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, obesity), personal habits such as smoking, and patient preference. The patient must be informed that although breast reconstruction can provide a good cosmetic result, it will never precisely duplicate the natural breast. Realistic preparation can help the patient avoid unrealistic expectations. Once reconstruction is complete, the opposite breast may require augmentation, reduction, or mastopexy to achieve symmetry on both sides. The patient must also be informed that breast reconstruction will not affect the risk of cancer recurrence. Reconstruction is considered an integral component in the surgical treatment of breast cancer and is usually covered by insurance companies.</p>
<p class="indent">Many women elect immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy operation. This can be beneficial in that it saves the woman from undergoing general anesthesia a second time and saves the cost and stress of future hospitalizations. However, it does increase the length of the surgical procedure. Delayed reconstruction is preferable in women who are having a difficult time deciding on the type of reconstruction that they desire. It may also be preferable in patients with advanced disease such as inflammatory breast cancer, where the breast cancer treatments should begin without delay; delayed reconstruction may also be beneficial if radiation is planned, as radiation therapy is technically less complicated on an unreconstructed chest wall (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3757">Fayanju, Garvey, Karuturi, et al., 2018</a>). Any delays in healing after immediate reconstruction may interfere with the initiation of treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2476">Tissue Expander Followed by Permanent Implant</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Breast reconstruction using a tissue expander followed by a permanent implant is the simplest and most common method in use (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-6">Fig.&#x00A0;52-6</a></span>). To accommodate an implant, the skin remaining after a mastectomy and the underlying muscle must gradually be stretched by a process called <em>tissue expansion.</em> The surgeon places a tissue expander (a balloonlike device) through the mastectomy incision underneath the pectoralis muscle. A small amount of saline is injected through a metal port intraoperatively to partially inflate the expander. Then, for about 6 to 8 weeks, at weekly intervals, the patient receives additional saline injections through the port until the expander is fully inflated. It remains fully expanded for about 6 weeks to allow the skin to loosen. The expander is then exchanged for a permanent implant. This is usually performed as an outpatient surgical procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Advantages of the expansion procedure are a shorter operating time and a shorter recuperation period than for autologous reconstruction (see the Tissue Transfer Procedures section). A disadvantage is a tendency for the implant to feel firm and round, with little natural ptosis (sag). Women with a small to medium opposite breast with little ptosis are good candidates for this procedure. Women who have had radiation or who have connective tissue disease are not good candidates because of the decreased elasticity of the skin.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The patient must be cautioned not to have an MRI while the tissue expander is in place because the port contains metal. This is not an issue once the permanent implant is in place because it does not contain any metal.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The patient should be informed that for the rest of her life she should not engage in any exercises that will develop the pectoralis muscle, because this can result in distortion of the reconstructed breast.</p>
