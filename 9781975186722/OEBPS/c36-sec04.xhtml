<h4 class="h4" id="s1450"><strong>Osteoarthritis (Degenerative Joint Disease)</strong> <img class="m" src="images/practice.jpg" alt="icon" /></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a noninflammatory degenerative disorder of the joints. It is the most common form of joint disease and is sometimes also called degenerative joint disease. OA is classified as either primary (idiopathic), with no prior event or disease related to the OA, or secondary, resulting from previous joint injury or inflammatory disease, similar to RA (see <a href="c34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a>). The pathophysiology of primary OA does not involve autoimmunity or inflammation. It can occur as an end result of an autoimmune disorder where joint destruction occurs. Another distinguishing characteristic of OA is that it is limited to the affected joints; there are no systemic symptoms associated with it (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">OA often begins in the third decade of life and peaks between the fifth and sixth decades. By 40 years of age, 90% of the population has degenerative joint changes in their weight-bearing joints, even though clinical symptoms are usually absent (CDC, 2018). Women, especially those who are Hispanic or African American, are more commonly affected. The incidence of OA increases with age. It is estimated that over 85% of the general population over 65 years of age has radiographic changes indicating OA. Although OA is usually thought of as a disease of aging, it can affect younger patients resulting in significant loss of work-related productivity (CDC, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1451">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All joints consist of bone, particularly <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;subchondral bone:&lt;/b&gt; bony plate that supports the articular cartilage">subchondral bone</button></strong> or the bony plate to which the articular cartilage is attached. This articular cartilage is a lubricated, smooth tissue that protects the bone from damage with physical activity. Between the articular cartilage of the bones forming the joint is a space (called the <em>joint space</em>) that allows for movement. To aid in fluidity, each joint contains synovial fluid to help lubricate and protect the joint&#x2019;s movement. With OA, the articular cartilage breaks down, leading to progressive damage to the underlying bone and eventual formation of <strong>osteophytes</strong> (bone spurs) that protrude into the joint space. The result is that the joint space is narrowed, leading to decreased joint movement and the potential for more damage. Consequently, the joint can progressively degenerate (see <a href="#ff36-7">Fig. 36-7</a>). Understanding of OA pathophysiology has been greatly expanded beyond what was previously thought of as simply &#x201C;wear and tear&#x201D; related to aging. The basic degenerative process in the joint exemplified in OA is presented in <a href="#ff36-8">Figure 36-8</a>. In addition to the degeneration, an infectious arthritis can occur. See later discussion of septic (infectious) arthritis.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk factors for the disease and its progression include older age, female gender, and obesity. In addition, certain occupations (e.g., those requiring laborious tasks); engaging in sport activities; and a history of previous injuries, muscle weakness, genetic predisposition, and certain diseases can also place patients at risk for joint destruction. The most prominent modifiable risk factor for OA is obesity. In fact, both quality <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1123" title="1123"></span>and quantity of life are reduced with OA, especially when obesity and OA are combined. A program of diet and exercise can help minimize symptoms of OA in patients with obesity (CDC, 2018).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1452">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The main clinical manifestations of OA are pain, stiffness, and functional impairment. The joint pain is usually aggravated by movement or exercise and relieved by rest. If morning stiffness is present, it is usually brief, lasting less than 30 minutes. The onset is routinely insidious, progressing over multiple years.</p>
<p class="indent">On physical examination, the affected joint may be enlarged with a decreased range of motion. Although OA occurs most often in weight-bearing joints (hips, knees, cervical and lumbar spine), the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are also often involved causing bony enlargements of the DIP (Heberden&#x2019;s nodes) and PIP (Bouchard&#x2019;s nodes) joints. Crepitus may be palpated, especially over the knee. Joint effusion, a sign of inflammation, is usually mild. No systemic manifestations are found.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1453">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood tests and examination of joint fluid are not useful in the diagnosis of OA but are occasionally indicated to rule out an autoimmune cause for the joint pain, such as RA. X-rays may show a narrowing of the joint space; osteophyte formation; and dense, thickened subchondral bone (O&#x2019;Neill &#x0026; Felson, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1454">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of management are to decrease pain and stiffness and to maintain or, when possible, improve joint mobility. Exercise, especially in the form of cardiovascular aerobic exercise and lower extremity strength training, has been found to prevent OA progression and decrease symptoms of OA. Along with exercise, weight loss, which in turn decreases excess load on the joint, can also be extremely beneficial. Occupational and physical therapy can help the patient adopt self-management strategies (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Schmidt, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Wedged insoles, knee braces, and other modalities are being evaluated as possible therapies aimed at treating the abnormalities in biomechanics found in OA. The use of orthotic devices (e.g., splints, braces) and walking aids (e.g., canes) can improve pain and function by decreasing force on the affected joint (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Schmidt, 2018</a>). Patients with arthritis often use complementary, alternative, and integrative health therapies, such as massage, yoga, pulsed electromagnetic fields, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and music therapy. These therapies may also include herbal and dietary supplements, other special diets, acupuncture, acupressure, wearing copper bracelets or magnets, and participation in T&#x2019;ai chi. Research is under way to determine the effectiveness of many of these treatments. To date, there is no definitive evidence showing their superiority to standard care; the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has encouraged the use of these therapies only if they do not interfere with medications and are found to increase comfort, mobility, and function for patients (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2582">Kolasinski, Neogi, Hochberg, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic management of OA is directed toward symptom management and pain control. Selection of medication is based on the patient&#x2019;s needs, the stage of disease, and the risk of side effects. Medications are used in conjunction with nonpharmacologic strategies. In most patients with OA, the initial analgesic therapy is acetaminophen. Some patients respond to the nonselective NSAIDs and COX-2 enzyme blockers; however, COX-2 enzyme blockers must be used with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1124" title="1124"></span>caution because of the associated risk of cardiovascular disease and little to no decrease in GI upset. Other medications that may be considered are nonopioids, such as tramadol, opioids in severe cases, and intra-articular corticosteroids (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2557">Cooper, Chapurlat, Al-Daghri, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2582">Kolasinski et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Topical analgesic agents such as capsaicin and methylsalicylate are also used. Topical diclofenac sodium gel has been FDA approved for the use of osteoarthritic joint pain in the hands and knees (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2557">Cooper et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2582">Kolasinski et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Methotrexate and colchicine, typically prescribed for treating RA and gout, respectively, may also be considered for some patients with OA who are refractory to other treatments. The pathophysiologic antecedents of these diseases are similar to those in OA, and it is believed that may explain the effectiveness of these medications in some select patients with OA (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2582">Kolasinski et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Raman, FitzGerald, &#x0026; Murphy, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other therapeutic approaches include glucosamine and chondroitin. Although it has been suggested that these substances modify cartilage structure, studies have not shown them to be effective (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2582">Kolasinski et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2616">Runhaar, Rozendaal, Middlekoop, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Viscosupplementation, the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into a joint (intra-articular), is thought to supplement the viscous properties of synovial fluid. These viscosupplements aim to prevent the loss of cartilage and repair chondral defects but lack strong evidence that support their use (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2582">Kolasinski et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2610">Raman, Henrontin, Chevalier, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1455">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain management and optimal functional ability are the major goals of nursing interventions. With those goals in mind, nursing management of the patient with OA includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches as well as education. The patient&#x2019;s understanding of the disease process and symptom pattern is critical to the plan of care. Because patients with OA usually are older, they may have other health problems. Commonly they are overweight, and they may have a sedentary lifestyle. Weight loss and exercise are important approaches to lessen pain and disability. Canes or other assistive devices for ambulation should be considered, and any stigma about the use of these devices should be explored. Exercises such as walking should be begun in moderation and increased gradually. Patients should plan their daily exercise for a time when the pain is least severe or plan to use an analgesic agent, if appropriate, before exercising. Adequate pain management is important for the success of an exercise program. Open discussion regarding the use of complementary, alternative, and integrative health therapies is important to maintain safe and effective practices for patients looking for relief.</p>
