<h4 class="h4" id="s1589">Dental Plaque and Caries</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tooth decay is an erosive process that begins with the action of bacteria on fermentable carbohydrates in the mouth, which produces acids that dissolve tooth enamel. Despite the fact tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, caries and periodontal disease can still occur for several reasons. Contributing factors include nutrition, soft drink consumption, and genetic predisposition. In addition, the extent of damage to the teeth may be related to the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Presence of dental plaque, which is a gluey, gelatinlike substance that adheres to the teeth</span></li>
<li><span>Length of time acids are in contact with the teeth</span></li>
<li><span>Strength of acids and the ability of the saliva to neutralize them</span></li>
<li><span>Susceptibility of the teeth to decay</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Dental decay begins with a small hole, usually in a fissure (a break in the tooth&#x2019;s enamel) or in an area that is hard to clean. Left unchecked, the decay extends into the dentin. Because dentin is not as hard as enamel, decay progresses more rapidly and in time, reaches the pulp of the tooth. The prevalence of dental caries in permanent teeth for adolescents ages 12 to 19 remains high at 56.8%, even though there is an increased use (48.1%) of sealants on permanent teeth in this age group. Adults ages 20 to 64 years have an 89.9% prevalence of dental caries in permanent teeth; however, only 26.1% of adults have untreated tooth decay in permanent teeth. Older adults (65 years and older) present with a 96.2% prevalence of dental caries, with 15.9% of their tooth decay untreated (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2885">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). Older adults are subject to decay from drug-induced or age-related oral dryness (see <a href="#ct39-1">Chart 39-1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Dentists can determine the extent of damage and the type of treatment needed using x-ray studies. Treatment for dental caries includes fillings, dental implants, or extraction, if necessary. In general, dental decay can occur in anyone.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1590">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Measures used to prevent and control primary dental caries include applying fluoride varnish/gel (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2913">Marinho, Worthington, Walsh, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>), using fluoride toothpaste, use of silver diamine fluoride compounds (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2887">Donovan, Marzola, Murphy, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>), applying dental sealants (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Twetman, 2015</a>), and ensuring community water fluoridation (HHS, 2000; HHS Federal Panel on Community Water Fluoridation, 2015). Other recommendations include implementing daily oral hygiene practices, seeking routine professional dental treatment, refraining from smoking and excessive alcohol use, making good dietary choices, and managing related systemic diseases (HHS, 2019). The inability to afford dental care is associated with a decrease in the quality of life of adults ages 45 years and older (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Naavaal, Griffin, &#x0026; Jones, 2019</a>), which must be considered when assisting patients in navigating health care systems.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mouth Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Healthy teeth must be cleaned several times a day. Brushing and flossing are particularly effective in mechanically breaking up the bacterial plaque that collects around teeth.</p>
<p class="indent">Mastication (chewing) and the normal flow of saliva also aid greatly in keeping the teeth clean. Because many ill patients do not consume adequate nutrients, they produce less saliva, which in turn reduces this natural tooth-cleaning process. The nurse may need to assume the responsibility for brushing the patient&#x2019;s teeth. Merely wiping the patient&#x2019;s mouth and teeth with a swab is ineffective. The most effective method is mechanical cleansing (brushing). If brushing is not possible, it is better to wipe the teeth with a gauze pad and then have the patient swish an antiseptic mouthwash several times before expectorating into an emesis basin. A soft-bristled toothbrush is more effective than a sponge or foam stick. Flossing should be performed daily. To prevent drying, the lips may be coated with a water-soluble gel.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Diet</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Dental caries may be prevented by decreasing the amount of sugar and starch in the diet. Patients who snack should be encouraged to choose less cariogenic alternatives, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, cheeses, or plain yogurt. Brushing after meals is recommended.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluoridation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluoridation of public water supplies has been found to decrease dental caries. Some areas of the country have natural fluoridation; other communities have added fluoride to public water supplies. As of 2014, 66.3% of Americans receive fluoridated water (CDC, 2020b). Studies suggest that by instituting a community water fluoridation program, tooth decay is reduced by 25% in both children and adults (CDC, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Fluoridation may also be achieved by having a dentist apply a concentrated gel or solution to the teeth; adding fluoride to home water supplies; using fluoridated toothpaste or mouth rinse; or using sodium fluoride tablets, drops, or lozenges.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pit and Fissure Sealants</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The occlusal surfaces of the teeth have pits and fissures&#x2014;areas that are prone to caries. Some dentists apply a coating to fill and seal these areas on the primary and permanent molars to protect them from potential exposure to cariogenic processes. These sealants can last 36 to 48 months and significantly prevent tooth decay. The economic benefits of applying sealants, especially in high-risk groups, exceed the costs and provide solid evidence for their use (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2887">Donovan et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1591">Dental Health and Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Studies are ongoing that show the link between oral health and chronic disease such as diabetes, heart disease, low birth weight, premature births, and stroke. It had long been posited that bacteria, specifically gram-negative bacteria, were the culprits that link periodontal disease to other systemic diseases, specifically coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction and stroke. More recently, it was confirmed that these bacteria cause an inflammatory response that initiates an increase in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, white blood cells, and fibrinogen. These markers are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Data from short-term studies suggest that if periodontal disease is treated, systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are reduced (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Hegde &#x0026; Awan, 2019</a>). One study reported that thrombus aspirate and arterial blood taken from patients who had an ischemic stroke contained streptococcal bacteria. The most commonly identified <em>Streptococcus</em> species (found in 79% of the sample), <em>Streptococcus mitis</em>, is typically found in the mouth. Although a preliminary study, there is evidence that these oral bacteria may contribute to the progression of cardiovascular thrombotic events (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2929">Patrakka, Pienim&#x00E4;ki, Tuomisto, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Oral Health Programme (2019) espouses a global focus on oral health promotion and disease prevention, with an emphasis on policy and guideline development to support equitable implementation of evidence-based practices in global communities. The Programme supports an emphasis on addressing modifiable risk factors (e.g., diet, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol, and oral hygiene), water sanitation, and fluoride initiatives. Initiatives recognize the impact of social, economic, political, and cultural determinants of health, and seek to integrate the existing and emerging systems that address the burden and disability that stem from oral disease (WHO, 2019).</p>
