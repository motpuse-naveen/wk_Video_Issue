<h4 class="h4" id="s3092">Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">PD is a slowly progressing neurologic movement disorder that eventually leads to disability. It affects about 1 million patients who are hospitalized in the United States each year (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Moore, Smith, &#x0026; Cho, 2017</a>). The disease affects men more often than women. Symptoms usually first appear in the fifth decade of life; however, cases have been diagnosed as early as 30 years of age. The degenerative or idiopathic form of PD is the most common; there is also a secondary form with a known or suspected cause. Although the cause of most cases is unknown, research suggests a multifactorial combination of age, environment, and heredity (AANN, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3093">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">PD is associated with decreased levels of dopamine resulting from degeneration of dopamine storage cells in the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia region of the brain (see <a href="#ff65-3">Fig.&#x00A0;65-3</a>). Fibers or neuronal pathways project from the substantia nigra to the corpus striatum, where neurotransmitters are vital to the control of complex body movements. Through the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (excitatory) and dopamine (inhibitory), striatal neurons relay messages to the higher motor centers that control and refine motor movements. The loss of dopamine stores in this area of the brain results in more excitatory neurotransmitters than inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to an imbalance that affects voluntary movement (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical symptoms do not appear until 60% of the pigmented neurons are lost and the striatal dopamine level is decreased by 80%. Cellular degeneration impairs the extrapyramidal tracts that control semiautomatic functions and coordinated movements; motor cells of the motor cortex and the pyramidal tracts are not affected. Researchers are working on uncovering the exact mechanism of neurodegeneration. Current theories suggest a combined and complicated interweaving of both environmental and genetic factors that affect numerous fundamental cellular processes. Fifteen percent of early PD cases are associated with multiple genetic mutations (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4523">Poewe, Seppi, Tanner, et al., 2017</a>). Ongoing research includes recognition of biomarkers and development of individualized treatment options (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Poewe et al., 2017</a>).</p>

The nuclei in the substantia nigra project fibers to the corpus striatum. The nerve fibers carry dopamine to the corpus striatum. The loss of dopamine nerve cells from the brain&#x2019;s substantia nigra is thought to be responsible for the symptoms of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3094">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">PD has a gradual onset, and symptoms progress slowly over a chronic, prolonged course. The cardinal signs are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia/akinesia, and postural instability (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Two major subtypes of PD are tremor dominant (most other symptoms are absent) and nontremor dominant (akinetic-rigid and postural instability).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tremor</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although symptoms are variable, a slow, unilateral resting tremor is present in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis. Resting tremor characteristically disappears with purposeful movement and during sleep but is evident when the extremities are motionless or at rest. The tremor may manifest as a rhythmic, slow turning motion (pronation&#x2013;supination) of the forearm and the hand and a motion of the thumb against the fingers as if rolling a pill between the fingers.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Rigidity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Resistance to passive limb movement characterizes muscle rigidity. Passive movement of an extremity may cause the limb to move in jerky increments, referred to as lead-pipe or cogwheel movements. Involuntary stiffness of the passive extremity increases when another extremity is engaged in voluntary active movement. Stiffness of the arms, legs, face, and posture are common. Early in the disease, the patient may complain of shoulder pain due to rigidity (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bradykinesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A common feature of PD is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bradykinesia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormally slow voluntary movements and speech">bradykinesia</button></strong>, which refers to the overall slowing of active movement (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Bronner &#x0026; Korczyn, 2017</a>). Patients may also take longer to complete activities and have difficulty initiating movement, such as rising from a sitting position or turning in bed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Postural Instability</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient commonly develops postural and gait problems. Due to a loss of postural reflexes, the patient stands with the head bent forward and walks with a propulsive gait. The posture is caused by the forward flexion of the neck, hips, knees, and elbows. The patient may walk faster and faster, trying to move the feet forward under the body&#x2019;s center of gravity (shuffling gait). Difficulty in pivoting causes loss of balance, either forward (propulsion) or backward (retropulsion). Gait impairment and postural instability place the patient at increased risk for falls (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The effect of PD on the basal ganglia often produces autonomic symptoms that include excessive and uncontrolled sweating, drooling, paroxysmal flushing, orthostatic hypotension, gastric and urinary retention, constipation, and sexual dysfunction (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Bronner &#x0026; Korczyn, 2017</a>). Dysphagia is a substantial problem, with more than 50% of patients reporting choking as well as vision and olfactory changes (AANN, 2019). Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension occurs in 30% to 50% of patients with PD (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Sin &#x0026; Khemani, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Psychiatric changes include depression, anxiety, dementia, delirium, hallucinations, and psychosis. Depression and anxiety are common; whether these are reactions to the disorder or related to a biochemical abnormality is uncertain (AANN, 2019). Stress, medications, and depression contribute to the cognitive changes of diminished executive functions, attention difficulties, decreased thinking, and word-finding challenges. More than 80% of patients with a 20-year disease duration of PD experience <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dementia:&lt;/b&gt; broad term for a syndrome characterized by a general decline in higher brain functioning, such as reasoning, with a pattern of eventual decline in the ability to perform even basic activities of daily living, such as toileting and eating">dementia</button></strong>, a broad term for a syndrome <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2124" title="2124"></span>characterized by a general decline in higher brain functioning, such as reasoning, with a pattern of eventual decline in ability to perform even basic ADLs, such as toileting and eating (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Gale, Acar, &#x0026; Daffner, 2018</a>). In addition, auditory and visual hallucinations have been reported in people with PD and may be associated with depression, dementia, lack of sleep, or adverse effects of medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypokinesia (abnormally diminished movement) is also common and may appear after the tremor. The freezing phenomenon refers to a transient inability to perform active movement and is thought to be an extreme form of bradykinesia. The patient tends to shuffle and exhibits a decreased arm swing as well. As dexterity declines, micrographia (small handwriting) develops. The face becomes increasingly masklike and expressionless, and the frequency of blinking decreases. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysphonia:&lt;/b&gt; voice impairment or altered voice production">Dysphonia</button></strong> (voice impairment or altered voice production) may occur as a result of weakness and incoordination of the muscles responsible for speech. In many cases, the patient develops dysphagia, begins to drool, and is at risk for choking and aspiration (AANN, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications associated with PD are common and are typically related to disorders of movement. As the disease progresses, patients are at risk for respiratory and urinary tract infection, skin breakdown, and injury from falls. The adverse effects of medications used to treat the symptoms are associated with numerous complications such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dyskinesia:&lt;/b&gt; impaired ability to execute voluntary movements">dyskinesia</button></strong> (impaired ability to execute voluntary movements) or orthostatic hypotension.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3095">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although laboratory tests and imaging studies are not helpful to the provider in diagnosing PD, ongoing research with PET and single-photon emission CT scanning has been helpful in understanding the disease and advancing treatment. Currently, the disease is diagnosed clinically from the patient&#x2019;s history and the presence of two of the four cardinal manifestations: tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Early diagnosis can be challenging because patients rarely are able to pinpoint when the symptoms started. Often, a family member notices a change such as stooped posture; a stiff arm; a slight limp; tremor; or slow, small handwriting. The medical history, presenting symptoms, neurologic examination, and response to pharmacologic management are carefully evaluated when making the diagnosis. Diagnosis is often confirmed by a positive response to a levodopa trial (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Revised Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a helpful assessment tool as it measures the disease progression including motor and nonmotor symptoms, and includes treatment complications (AANN, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3096">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment is directed toward controlling symptoms and maintaining functional independence, because no medical or surgical approaches in current use prevent disease progression (AANN, 2019). Care is individualized for each patient based on presenting symptoms and social, occupational, and emotional needs. Pharmacologic management is the mainstay of treatment, although advances in research have led to more surgical options. Patients are usually cared for at home and are admitted to the hospital only for complications or to initiate new treatments.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Antiparkinsonian medications act by increasing striatal dopaminergic activity; reducing the excessive influence of excitatory cholinergic neurons on the extrapyramidal tract, thereby restoring a balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activities; or acting on neurotransmitter pathways other than the dopaminergic pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">Levodopa is the most effective agent and the mainstay of treatment. Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the basal ganglia, producing symptom relief. Carbidopa is often added to levodopa to avoid metabolism of levodopa before it can reach the brain. The beneficial effects of levodopa therapy are most pronounced in the first year or two of treatment. Benefits begin to wane and adverse effects become more severe over time (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Within 5 to 10 years, most patients develop a response to the medication characterized by dyskinesia including facial grimacing, rhythmic jerking movements of the hands, head bobbing, chewing and smacking movements, and involuntary movements of the trunk and extremities. The patient may experience an on&#x2013;off syndrome in which sudden periods of near immobility (&#x201C;off effect&#x201D;) are followed by a sudden return of effectiveness of the medication (&#x201C;on effect&#x201D;). Changing the drug dosing regimen or switching to other drugs may be helpful in minimizing the on&#x2013;off syndrome. Other potential adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, decreased BP, dystonia, dyskinesia, and confusion (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). To minimize adverse effects of levodopa over time, current practice includes delaying use of levodopa-containing drugs as long as possible, with the use of other drugs for symptom control in the interim. <a href="#tt65-1">Table&#x00A0;65-1</a> provides a summary of select medications used in PD.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The limitations of levodopa therapy, improvements in surgical techniques, and new approaches in transplantation have renewed interest in the surgical treatment of PD. In patients with disabling tremor, rigidity, or severe levodopa-induced dyskinesia, surgery may be considered. Although surgery provides symptom relief in select patients, it has not been shown to alter the course of the disease or to produce permanent improvement.</p>
<p class="h7">Stereotactic Procedures</p>
<p class="nonindent">Thalamotomy and pallidotomy are ablative procedures that were formerly used to relieve symptoms of PD such as tremors. However, these procedures permanently destroy brain tissue and are rarely used today. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has largely replaced ablative procedures in the surgical treatment of PD. DBS involves surgical implantation of an electrode into the brain in either the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus. Stimulation of these areas may increase dopamine release or block anticholinergic release, thereby improving tremor and rigidity. Levodopa medication dose may be able to be reduced, thus improving dyskinesias.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients eligible for DBS are those who have responded to levodopa but are impaired by dyskinesias, have had the disease for at least 5 years, and are disabled by tremor. Patients with dementia and atypical PD are usually not considered for surgical procedures. PD rating scales and specific neurologic tests are used to identify patients who are eligible. Surgical treatment typically occurs 10 to 13 years after diagnosis (AANN, 2019).</p>

<p class="indent">A CT or MRI scan is used to localize the appropriate surgical site in the brain. Then, the patient&#x2019;s head is positioned in a stereotactic frame (see <a href="#ff65-4">Fig.&#x00A0;65-4</a>). After the surgeon makes an incision in the skin and a burr hole, an electrode is passed through to the target area to the subthalamic nuclei or globus pallidus. The desired response of the patient to the electrical stimulation (i.e., a decrease in rigidity) is used to confirm electrode placement. Electrode placement is completed on one side of the brain at a time; bilateral electrodes are usually placed (AANN, 2019). Electrodes are then connected to a pulse generator that is implanted in a subcutaneous subclavicular or abdominal pouch (see <a href="#ff65-5">Fig.&#x00A0;65-5</a>). The battery-powered pulse generator sends high-frequency electrical impulses through a wire placed under the skin to a lead anchored to the skull (see <a href="#ff65-6">Fig.&#x00A0;65-6</a>). These devices are not without complications that can result from both the surgical procedure needed for implantation (e.g., weakness, paresthesias, confusion, hemorrhage) and the device itself (e.g., infection, lead leakage) (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse gathers information focusing on how the disease has affected the patient&#x2019;s ADLs and functional abilities. The patient is observed for degree of disability and functional changes that occur throughout the day, such as responses to medication. Almost every patient with a movement disorder has some functional alteration and may have some type of behavioral dysfunction. The following questions may be useful to assess alterations:</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have you had any recent falls?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During this assessment, the nurse observes the patient for quality of speech, loss of facial expression, swallowing deficits (drooling, poor head control, coughing), tremors, slowness of movement, weakness, forward posture, rigidity, evidence of mental slowness, and confusion. PD symptoms, as well as side effects of medications, put these patients at high risk for falls; therefore, a fall risk assessment should be conducted (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A progressive program of daily exercise will increase muscle strength, improve coordination and dexterity, reduce muscular rigidity, and prevent contractures that occur when muscles are not used (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Walking, riding a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2127" title="2127"></span>stationary bicycle, swimming, and gardening are all exercises that help maintain joint mobility. Stretching (stretch&#x2013;hold&#x2013;relax) and range-of-motion exercises promote joint flexibility. Postural exercises are important to counter the tendency of the head and neck to be drawn forward and down. A physical therapist may be helpful in developing an individualized exercise program and can provide instruction to the patient and caregiver on exercising safely. Faithful adherence to an exercise and walking program helps delay the progress of the disease. Warm baths and massage, in addition to passive and active exercises, help relax muscles and relieve painful muscle spasms that accompany rigidity.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Balance may be adversely affected because of the rigidity of the arms (arm swinging is necessary in normal walking). Special walking techniques must be learned to offset the shuffling gait and the tendency to lean forward. The patient is educated to concentrate on walking erect, to watch the horizon, and to use a wide-based gait (i.e., walking with the feet separated). A conscious effort must be made to swing the arms, raise the feet while walking, and use a heel&#x2013;toe placement of the feet with long strides. The patient is advised to practice walking to marching music or to the sound of a ticking metronome, because this provides sensory reinforcement. Performing breathing exercises while walking provides additional movement of the ribcage and aerates larger parts of the lungs. Frequent rest periods aid in preventing frustration and fatigue.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">E<small>NHANCING</small> S<small>ELF</small>-C<small>ARE</small> A<small>CTIVITIES</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Encouraging, educating, and supporting the patient during ADLs promote self-care (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Environmental modifications are necessary to compensate for functional disability. Patients may have severe mobility problems that make normal activities impossible. Adaptive or assistive devices may be useful. A hospital bed at home with bedside rails, an over-bed frame with a trapeze, or a rope tied to the foot of the bed can provide assistance in pulling up without help. An occupational therapist can evaluate the patient&#x2019;s needs in the home, make recommendations regarding adaptive devices, and educate the patient and caregiver how to improvise.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">I<small>MPROVING</small> B<small>OWEL</small> E<small>LIMINATION</small></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient may have severe problems with constipation. Among the factors causing constipation are weakness of the muscles used in defecation, lack of exercise, inadequate fluid intake, and decreased autonomic nervous system activity. The medications used for the treatment of the disease also inhibit normal intestinal secretions. A regular bowel routine may be established by encouraging the patient to follow a regular time pattern, consciously increase fluid intake, and eat foods with moderate fiber content. Laxatives should be avoided. Psyllium, for example, decreases constipation but carries the risk of bowel obstruction (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). A raised toilet seat is useful because the patient has difficulty in moving from a standing to a sitting position. Additional time may be needed for the patient to navigate to the toilet due to gait disturbances.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients may have difficulty maintaining their weight. Eating becomes a very slow process, requiring concentration due to a dry mouth from medications and difficulty chewing and swallowing. These patients are at risk for aspiration because of impaired swallowing and the accumulation of saliva. They may be unaware that they are aspirating; subsequently, pneumonia may develop (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4490">Aslam, Simpson, Baugh, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Monitoring weight on a weekly basis indicates whether caloric intake is adequate. Supplemental feedings increase caloric intake. As the disease progresses, a nasogastric or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may be necessary to maintain adequate nutrition. A consultation with dietitian may be indicated.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> S<small>WALLOWING</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Swallowing difficulties and choking are common in PD, leading to aspiration and pneumonia. To offset the aspiration risk, the patient should sit in an upright position during mealtime (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Aslam et al., 2019</a>). A semisolid diet with thick liquids is easier to swallow than solids; thin liquids should be avoided. The patient is instructed to think through the swallowing sequence, place the food on the tongue, close the lips and teeth, lift the tongue up and then back, and swallow. The patient is encouraged to chew first on one side of the mouth and then on the other. To control the buildup of saliva, the patient is reminded to hold the head upright and make a conscious effort to swallow. Massaging the facial and neck muscles before meals may be beneficial.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NCOURAGING THE</small> U<small>SE OF</small> A<small>SSISTIVE</small> D<small>EVICES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">An electric warming tray keeps food hot and allows the patient to rest during the prolonged time that it may take to eat. Special utensils also assist at mealtime. A plate that is stabilized, a nonspill cup, and eating utensils with built-up handles are useful self-help devices. The occupational therapist can assist in identifying appropriate adaptive devices.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> C<small>OMMUNICATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Speech disorders are present in most patients with PD. The low-pitched, monotonous, soft speech of patients requires that they make a conscious effort to speak slowly, with deliberate attention to what they are saying. The patient is reminded to face the listener, exaggerate the pronunciation of words, speak in short sentences, and take a few deep breaths before speaking. A speech therapist may be helpful in designing speech improvement exercises and assisting the family and health care personnel to develop and use a method of communication that meets the patient&#x2019;s needs. A small electronic amplifier is helpful if the patient has difficulty being heard.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>S<small>UPPORTING</small> C<small>OPING</small> A<small>BILITIES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Support can be given by encouraging the patient and pointing out that activities will be maintained through active participation. Patients with PD can become socially and emotionally withdrawn. It is best if patients are active participants in their therapeutic program, including social and recreational events.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients often feel embarrassed, apathetic, inadequate, bored, and lonely. In part, these feelings may result from physical slowness and the great effort that even small tasks require. The patient is assisted and encouraged to set achievable goals (e.g., improvement of mobility). Every effort should be made to encourage patients to carry out the tasks involved in meeting their own daily needs and to remain independent. Doing things for the patient merely to save time undermines <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2128" title="2128"></span>the basic goal of improving coping abilities and promoting a positive self-concept.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A planned program of activity throughout the day prevents too much daytime sleeping as well as disinterest and apathy. When sleep disturbances occur, several interventions can improve sleep, including limiting caffeine intake before bedtime and assessing for nocturia.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with PD is monitored regularly for signs and symptoms of depression. An interprofessional approach with a combination of physiotherapy, psychotherapy, medication therapy, and support group participation is used to treat depression when diagnosed (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient in late stages of PD is particularly at risk for psychiatric disturbances such as hallucinations, psychosis, and paranoid delusions (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Interventions to manage psychiatric disturbances include low doses of antipsychotic drugs, minimizing medications with psychiatric side effects (see <a href="#tt65-1">Table&#x00A0;65-1</a>), and avoidance of dopamine depleting medications (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Patients and their caregivers benefit from an interprofessional approach to care when psychiatric disturbances are present.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, OR</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> <span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patient and family education is important in the management of PD. The needs depend on the severity of symptoms and the stage of the disease. Care must be taken not to overwhelm the patient and family with too much information early in the disease process. Ongoing assessment, intervention, and evaluation of the patient and family&#x2019;s adaptations and education requirements are necessary with every encounter. The strategies to promote health include a clear explanation of the disease and the goal of assisting the patient to remain functionally independent as long as possible (see <a href="#ct65-3">Chart&#x00A0;65-3</a>). The patient and family must be educated about the effects and side effects of medications and about the importance of reporting side effects to the primary provider. Nurses in the home help patients and their families enhance self-management and quality of life.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Family members and partners often serve as caregivers, with home, community-based, or transitional services available to assist in meeting health care needs as the disease progresses. The caregiver may be under considerable stress from living with and caring for a person with a significant disability. Providing information about treatment and care helps anticipate future needs. The caregiver is included in the plan and may be advised to learn stress reduction techniques, to include others in the caregiving process, to obtain periodic relief from responsibilities, and to have a yearly health assessment. Allowing family members and partners to express feelings of frustration, anger, and guilt is often helpful to them.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient should be evaluated in the home for adaptation and safety needs and adherence to the plan of care. In the advanced stages, patients usually enter long-term care facilities. Periodically, admission to an acute care facility may be necessary for changes in medical management or treatment of complications. Nurses provide support, education, and monitoring of patients over the course of the illness.</p>
