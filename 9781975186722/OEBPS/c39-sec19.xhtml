<h4 class="h4" id="s1650">Benign Tumors of the Esophagus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Benign tumors are rare, but can arise anywhere along the esophagus. The most common lesion is a leiomyoma (tumor of the smooth muscle), which can occlude the lumen of the esophagus and cause dysphagia, pain, and pyrosis. Half of patients with benign tumors are asymptomatic and the other half present with multiple symptoms that have been present for a long period of time. The diagnosis may be made incidentally and is confirmed by endoscopy and needle biopsy. Due to the slow growth of most of these tumors, monitoring and minimally invasive techniques (endoscopic, thoracic, or laparoscopic resections) tend to be indicated rather than surgical resection (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2898">Ha, Regan, Cetindag, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Emergency disorders of the esophagus (perforation, chemical burns) usually occur in the home or away from medical help and require emergency medical care. The patient is treated for shock and respiratory distress and transported as quickly as possible to a health care facility. Foreign bodies in the esophagus do not pose an immediate threat to life unless pressure is exerted on the trachea, resulting in dyspnea or interfering with respiration, or unless there is leakage of caustic alkali from a battery or exposure to another corrosive agent.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For nonemergency symptoms, a complete health history may reveal the nature of the esophageal disorder. The nurse asks about the patient&#x2019;s appetite. Has it remained the same, increased, or decreased? Is there any discomfort with swallowing? If so, does it occur only with certain foods? Is it associated with pain? Does a change in position affect the discomfort? The patient is asked to describe the pain. Does anything aggravate it? Are there any other symptoms that occur regularly, such as regurgitation, nocturnal regurgitation, eructation (belching), pyrosis, substernal pressure, a sensation that food is sticking in the throat, a feeling of fullness after eating a small amount of food, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss? Are the symptoms aggravated by emotional upset? If the patient reports any of these symptoms, the nurse asks about when they occur, their relationship to eating, and factors that relieve or aggravate them (e.g., position change, belching, antacids, vomiting; Bickley, 2016).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">This history also includes questions about past or present causative factors, such as infections and chemical, mechanical, or physical irritants; alcohol and tobacco use; and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1259" title="1259"></span>amount of daily food intake. The nurse determines whether the patient appears emaciated and auscultates the patient&#x2019;s chest to assess for pulmonary complications (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Bickley, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional intake associated with difficulty swallowing</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for aspiration associated with difficulty swallowing or tube feeding</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with difficulty swallowing, ingestion of an abrasive agent, tumor, or frequent episodes of gastric reflux</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rLast"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about the esophageal disorder, diagnostic studies, medical management, surgical intervention, and rehabilitation</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include attainment of adequate nutritional intake, avoidance of respiratory compromise from aspiration, relief of pain, and increased knowledge level.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NCOURAGING</small> A<small>DEQUATE</small> N<small>UTRITIONAL</small> I<small>NTAKE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is encouraged to eat slowly and to chew all food thoroughly so that it can pass easily into the stomach. Small, frequent feedings of nonirritating foods are recommended to promote digestion and to prevent tissue irritation. Sometimes liquid swallowed with food helps the food pass through the esophagus, but usually liquids should be consumed between meals. Food should be prepared in an appealing manner to help stimulate the appetite. Irritants such as tobacco and alcohol should be avoided. A baseline weight is obtained, and daily weights are recorded. The patient&#x2019;s intake of nutrients is assessed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>D<small>ECREASING</small> R<small>ISK OF</small> A<small>SPIRATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient who has difficulty swallowing or difficulty managing secretions should be kept in at least a semi-Fowler position to decrease the risk of aspiration. The patient is instructed in the use of oral suction to decrease the risk of aspiration further.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Small, frequent feedings (6 to 8 per day) are recommended because large quantities of food overload the stomach and promote gastric reflux. The patient is advised to avoid any activities that increase pain and to remain upright for 1 to 4&#x00A0;hours after each meal to prevent reflux. The head of the bed should be placed on 4- to 8-inch (10- to 20-cm) blocks. Eating before bedtime is discouraged.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is advised that excessive use of over-the-counter antacids can cause rebound acidity. Antacid use should be directed by the primary provider, who can recommend the daily, safe dose needed to neutralize gastric juices and prevent esophageal irritation. H<sub>2</sub>-antagonists or PPIs (more commonly) are given as prescribed to decrease gastric acid irritation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> P<small>ATIENT</small> E<small>DUCATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is prepared physically and psychologically for diagnostic tests, treatments, and possible surgery. Nursing interventions include reassuring the patient and explaining the procedures and their purposes. Some disorders of the esophagus evolve over time, whereas others are the result of trauma (e.g., chemical burns, perforation). In instances of trauma, the emotional and physical preparation for treatment is more difficult because of the short time available and the circumstances of the injury. Treatment interventions must be evaluated continually, and the patient is given sufficient information to participate in care and diagnostic tests. If endoscopic diagnostic methods are used, the patient is instructed regarding the moderate sedation that will be used during the procedure. If outpatient procedures are performed with the use of moderate sedation, someone must be available to drive the patient home after the procedure. If surgery is required, immediate and long-term evaluation is similar to that for a patient undergoing thoracic surgery.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED</small>, <small>AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The self-care required of the patient depends on the nature of the disorder and on the surgery or treatment measures used (e.g., diet, positioning, medications). If an ongoing condition exists, the nurse helps the patient plan for needed physical and psychological adjustments and for follow-up care (see <a href="#ct39-8">Chart 39-8</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Special equipment, such as suction or enteral or parenteral feeding devices, may be required. The patient may need assistance in planning meals, using medications as prescribed, and resuming activities. Education about nutritional requirements and how to measure the adequacy of nutrition is important. Older adults and patients who are debilitated in particular often need assistance and education about ways they can adjust to their limitations and resume activities that are important to them.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Patients with chronic esophageal conditions require an individualized approach to their management at home. Foods may need to be prepared in a special way (blenderized foods, soft foods), and the patient may need to eat more frequently (e.g., 6 to 8 small servings per day). The medication schedule is adjusted to the patient&#x2019;s daily activities as much as possible. Analgesic medications and antacids can usually be taken as needed every 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Postoperative home health care focuses on nutritional support, management of pain, and respiratory function. Some patients are discharged from the hospital with enteral feeding by means of a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube, or parenteral nutrition. The patient and caregiver need specific instructions regarding management of the equipment and treatments. Home care visits by a nurse may be necessary to assess the patient and the caregiver&#x2019;s ability to provide the necessary care. A multidisciplinary team that includes a dietitian, a social worker, and family members is helpful. Hospice care and consideration of end-of-life issues are appropriate for some patients.</p>
