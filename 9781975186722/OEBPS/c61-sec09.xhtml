<h4 class="h4" id="s2961">Pseudobulbar Affect</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The condition known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pseudobulbar affect:&lt;/b&gt; emotional disturbance characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying or laughing, or other emotional displays">pseudobulbar affect</button></strong> involves inappropriate or exaggerated emotional expression, usually episodes of laughing or crying. It is associated with brain injury (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis [MS], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], AD, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease). The term &#x201C;pseudobulbar&#x201D; refers to damage that occurs in the corticobulbar tracts in the brain (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>). The emotional outbursts can cause embarrassment, anxiety, and depression, and often impair quality of life (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults with pseudobulbar affect can respond appropriately to treatment. Initial management involves evaluation and recognition that this condition can coexist with mood disorders, such as depression, although crying in these patients should not be considered indicative of depression. Pharmacology studies have reported effective management with dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate in patients with ALS, MS, stroke, TBI, and dementia (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hakimi &#x0026; Maurer, 2018</a>).</p>
