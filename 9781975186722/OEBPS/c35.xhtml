<p class="nonindent">The musculoskeletal system is composed of the bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bursae of the body. The major functions of this system are to support and protect the body and foster movement of the extremities. The components of this system are highly integrated; therefore, disease in or injury to one component adversely affects the others. For instance, an infection in a joint (e.g., septic arthritis) causes degeneration of the articular surfaces of the bones within the joint and local muscle atrophy.</p>
<p class="indent">Musculoskeletal disorders and injuries directly affect the quality of life of individuals and are a leading cause of disability in the United States. The annual cost to treat these conditions is estimated to be over $980 billion for direct costs as well as indirect costs, such as lost wages from loss of work time (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2528">United States Bone and Joint Initiative [USBJI], 2018</a>). Arthritis is the chief cause of musculoskeletal-related disability in the United States, with an estimated 54.4 million adults diagnosed with this disorder. Because the incidence of arthritis increases with age, the number of adults with arthritis is expected to increase to 78 million by 2040 (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2521">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). Nurses in all practice areas may encounter patients with complaints about or impairment of the musculoskeletal system.</p>
