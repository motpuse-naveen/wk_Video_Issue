<p class="nonindent">Allergic disorders are common and are encountered by nurses in every setting, from the community to the intensive care unit. Expert management of patients with allergic disorders is integral to nursing regardless of the practice setting. This chapter covers general allergic assessment and management of various allergic disorders including anaphylaxis.</p>
<p class="indent">The human body is bombarded by a host of potential invaders&#x2014;allergens as well as microbial organisms&#x2014;that constantly threaten its defenses. These invaders are termed <strong>antigens</strong>. After penetrating the body&#x2019;s defenses, these antigens, if allowed to continue unimpeded, disrupt the body&#x2019;s enzyme systems and destroy its vital tissues. To protect against these antigens, the body is equipped with an elaborate defense system.</p>
<p class="indent">The epithelial cells that coat the skin and make up the lining of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts provide the first line of defense against microbial invaders. The structure and continuity of these surfaces and their resistance to penetration are initial deterrents to antigens (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall, Warrington, Watson, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most effective defense mechanisms is the body&#x2019;s capacity to equip itself rapidly with antibodies specifically designed to combat each new invader&#x2014;namely, specific protein antigens. Antibodies react with antigens in a variety of ways: (1) by coating the antigens&#x2019; surfaces, (2) by neutralizing the antigens, and (3) by precipitating the antigens out of solution if they are dissolved. The antibodies prepare the antigens so that the phagocytic cells of the blood and the tissues can eliminate them. However, although this system is normally protective, in some cases the body produces inappropriate or exaggerated responses to specific antigens, and the result is an allergic or hypersensitivity disorder.</p>
