<p class="nonindent">Structural, infectious, and inflammatory disorders of the heart present many challenges for the patient, family, and health care team. Various mechanisms, heart valve disorders, cardiomyopathies, and infectious diseases of the heart alter cardiac output. Treatments for these disorders may be noninvasive or invasive. Noninvasive treatments often consist of medication therapy, diet changes, and activity modification. Invasive treatments include valve repair or replacement, ventricular assist devices (VADs), total artificial hearts (TAHs), cardiac transplantation, or other surgical procedures. Nurses have an integral role in the care of patients with structural, infectious, and inflammatory cardiac conditions.</p>
