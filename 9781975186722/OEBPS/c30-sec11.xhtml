<h4 class="h4" id="s1236">Primary Myelofibrosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Primary myelofibrosis, also known as agnogenic myeloid metaplasia or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, is the rarest of the Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders; it arises from neoplastic transformation of an early HSC. This disease is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis or scarring, extramedullary hematopoiesis (typically involving the spleen or liver), leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and anemia. Some patients have <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pancytopenia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal decrease in WBCs, RBCs, and platelets">pancytopenia</button></strong> (i.e., diminished leukocyte, platelet, and erythrocyte counts). Patients with primary myelofibrosis have increased <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;angiogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; growth of new blood vessels that allow cancer cells to grow">angiogenesis</button></strong> (formation of new blood vessels) within the marrow. Immature forms of blood cells, including nucleated RBCs and megakaryocyte fragments, are frequently found in the circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">The actual etiology for primary myelofibrosis is still unknown. As with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, mutations of the <em>JAK2</em> or <em>CALR</em> gene are frequently seen; prognosis is worse in those without genetic mutations. Myelofibrosis may also be secondary in nature, evolving from polycythemia vera, or less frequently, from essential thrombocythemia. In these instances, the disease progression is then called <em>secondary myelofibrosis</em> (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2214">Harrison et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Primary myelofibrosis is a disease of the older adult, with a median age of diagnosis at approximately 65 to 70 years of age, and is more common in males (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019e). Another risk factor is exposure to chemicals (e.g., benzene). Average survival ranges from 2 to 14 years. Common causes of death are due to cardiovascular disease, liver failure, leukemic transformation, and consequences of marrow failure (e.g., infection or bleeding).</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately 90% of patients present at the time of diagnosis with splenomegaly, causing abdominal discomfort and early satiety. Many patients also experience constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, and fever, as well as pruritus, bone pain, weight loss, cachexia, thrombosis, and bleeding (see <a href="#ff30-6">Fig. 30-6</a>) (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2261">Tefferi, 2018</a>). Arterial or venous thrombosis can occur but is less frequent than that found in polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. Anemia occurs due to impaired erythropoiesis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1237">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of therapy are based upon reducing the burden of disease (by decreasing symptoms and splenomegaly) and improving blood counts (NCCN, 2019f). Treatment is based upon a patient&#x2019;s risk stratification; risks are increased in patients older than 65 years of age, with WBC counts above 25,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, with hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL, with blast cells present in the peripheral blood, and with presence of constitutional symptoms (e.g., pruritus, night sweats, weight loss; see <a href="c30-sec09.xhtml#tt30-2">Table 30-2</a>) (NCCN, 2019f).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are at low risk and asymptomatic, observation and monitoring every 3 to 6 months is recommended. Patients at intermediate risk may be started on the <em>JAK2</em> inhibitor ruxolitinib if symptomatic (see previous discussion in Polycythemia Vera), or may be considered for allogeneic HSCT. HSCT is a useful treatment modality in younger, otherwise healthy patients; it is the only current therapy that can reverse the fibrosis within the marrow (NCCN, 2019f).</p>
<p class="indent">Splenectomy may be performed to control potential or actual complications of an enlarged spleen. However, a reactive thrombocytosis and leukocytosis can develop because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page969" title="969"></span>the platelets and leukocytes are no longer sequestered by the spleen and enter the circulation. Careful considerations of the advantages and disadvantages of a splenectomy should be discussed with the patient as the procedure is not without risk.</p>

<p class="indent">Anemia is most commonly managed with PRBC transfusions. Erythroid-stimulating agents (e.g., recombinant erythropoietin) may improve anemia to the extent that transfusion requirements are reduced. Other pharmacologic agents are used to diminish splenomegaly and improve blood counts. Hydroxyurea is often used to control high leukocyte and platelet counts and to reduce the size of the spleen. Angiogenic inhibitors such as thalidomide or pomalidomide may be useful in improving anemia and reducing an enlarged spleen.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1238">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Splenomegaly can be profound in patients with myelofibrosis, with enlargement of the spleen that may extend to the pelvic rim. This condition is extremely uncomfortable and can severely limit nutritional intake. Analgesic agents are usually ineffective. Splenomegaly, coupled with the hypermetabolic state that ensues with having an active neoplasm, results in significant weight loss, muscle wasting, and weakness. Patients benefit from small, frequent meals of foods that are high in calories and protein. Fatigue has been reported in up to 94% of patients with primary myelofibrosis (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2261">Geyer &#x0026; Mesa, 2014</a>). The nurse should educate patients about appropriate energy conservation methods. <a href="#tt30-3">Table 30-3</a> identifies useful strategies at managing fatigue.</p>

<p class="indent">The patient needs to be educated about signs and symptoms of infection, bleeding, and thrombosis, as well as appropriate interventions if these occur. Ensuring that the patient takes steps to decrease cardiovascular risk factors associated with developing thrombosis (e.g., obesity, smoking, and poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia) is also important.</p>
