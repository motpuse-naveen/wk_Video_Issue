<h4 class="h4" id="s1694">Fecal Incontinence</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fecal incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary passage of feces">Fecal incontinence</button></strong> or inadvertent bowel leakage describes the recurrent involuntary passage of stool from the rectum for at least 3 months. Factors that influence this disorder include the ability of the rectum to sense and accommodate stool, the amount and consistency of stool, the integrity of the anal sphincters and musculature, and rectal motility. Fecal incontinence is a widespread problem, affecting at least 7 out of 100 nonhospitalized adults and at least half of adults who reside in long-term care facilities (i.e., nursing homes) (NIDDK, 2017b). Fecal incontinence can have a substantially negative impact on quality of life (NIDDK, 2017b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1695">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fecal incontinence has many causes and risk factors and may be a symptom of an underlying condition. In general, it results from conditions that interrupt or disrupt the structure or function of the anorectal unit. Common causes include anal sphincter weakness, both traumatic (e.g., after surgical procedures involving the rectum) and nontraumatic (e.g., scleroderma); neuropathies, both peripheral (e.g., pudendal) and generalized (e.g., diabetes); disorders of the pelvic floor (e.g., rectal prolapse); inflammation (radiation proctitis, IBD); central nervous system disorders (e.g., dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis); diarrhea; fecal impaction with overflow; and behavioral disorders. It is less commonly a long-term consequence of vaginal childbirth injuries than in years past, most likely because of improved delivery methods. It is more common with advancing age (i.e., weakness or loss of anal or rectal muscle tone) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Emmanuel, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3097">Rao, Bharucha, Chiaroni, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1696">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients may have minor soiling, occasional urgency and loss of control, or complete incontinence. Patients may also experience poor control of flatus, diarrhea, or constipation. Passive incontinence occurs without warning; whereas, patients with urge incontinence have the sensation of the urge to defecate but cannot reach the toilet in time (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rao et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1697">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessing the patient&#x2019;s medical history is helpful in identifying the most likely etiology. Diagnostic studies are necessary because the treatment of fecal incontinence depends on the cause. A rectal examination and an endoscopic examination such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy are performed to rule out tumors, inflammation, fissures, or impaction. Anorectal manometry, defecography, electromyography, anal endosonography, pelvic MRI scan, and transit studies may be helpful in identifying alterations in intestinal mucosa and muscle tone or in detecting other structural or functional problems (NIDDK, 2017b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1698">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of fecal incontinence is directed at correcting the underlying cause. If fecal incontinence is related to diarrhea, the incontinence may disappear when diarrhea is successfully treated. Fecal incontinence secondary to a fecal impaction may cease after the impaction is removed and the rectum is cleansed. If the fecal incontinence is related to the use of contributory drugs (e.g., laxatives, antacids containing magnesium), the incontinence may improve or cease when the drug regimen is altered. When fecal incontinence is related to other disorders, treatments targeted at correcting the underlying disorder are initiated. Some patients benefit from the addition of psyllium as a fiber supplement. In addition, administering loperamide 30 minutes prior to meals can be an effective intervention in some patients. Biofeedback therapy with pelvic floor muscle training can be of assistance if the problem is decreased sensory awareness or sphincter control. Transanal irrigation and bowel training programs, including techniques to assist evacuation such as abdominal massage, Valsalva maneuver, and digital rectal stimulation can also be effective (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Emmanuel, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rao et al., 2016</a>). Sacral nerve stimulation, provided by implanting a subcutaneous stimulator that delivers low amplitude electrical stimulation to the sacral nerve, may be an option for some patients refractory to other interventions (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Emmanuel, 2019</a>). Surgical procedures include surgical reconstruction or repair of anal sphincter, artificial sphincter implantation, anal sphincter bulking by injection of synthetic agents, sacral nerve stimulation, or fecal diversion (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Emmanuel, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1699">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse obtains a thorough health history, including information about previous surgical procedures, chronic illnesses, dietary patterns, bowel habits and problems, and current medication regimen. A bowel diary covering a 1- to 2-week period may be helpful in identifying elimination patterns and factors affecting bowel function (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Emmanuel, 2019</a>). Stool charts (e.g., Bristol Stool Form, see later discussion) may help with identifying frequency, volume, and consistency of the feces. The nurse also completes an examination of the rectal area. If a fecal impaction is noted, it must be removed before instituting any preventive therapies (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gump &#x0026; Schmelzer, 2016</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Taylor, Lynn, &#x0026; Bartlett, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse initiates a bowel training program that involves setting a schedule to establish bowel regularity. The goal is to help the patient achieve fecal continence. If this is not possible, the goal should be to manage the problem so the patient can have predictable, planned elimination. Sometimes it is necessary to use suppositories to stimulate the anal reflex. After the patient has achieved a regular schedule, the suppository can be discontinued. Biofeedback in conjunction with pelvic floor exercises can be used to help the patient improve sphincter contractility and rectal sensitivity. Bowel regulation also involves the therapeutic use of diet and fiber. Foods that thicken stool (e.g., applesauce) and fiber supplements help improve continence (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gump &#x0026; Schmelzer, 2016</a>). Conversely, foods that loosen stool (e.g., rhubarb, figs, prunes, plums) should be avoided. Some patients with fecal incontinence <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1293" title="1293"></span>may benefit from the use of antidiarrheal medications (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gump &#x0026; Schmelzer, 2016</a>). Loperamide and diphenoxylate with atropine can be used; loperamide is the preferred medication because it does not cause central nervous system adverse effects (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rao et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Fecal incontinence can disrupt perineal skin integrity. Maintaining skin integrity is a priority, especially in the debilitated or older adult patient. Incontinence briefs or adult diapers, although helpful in containing the fecal material, permit increased skin contact with feces and may cause skin excoriation. In general, incontinence briefs are to be used only for brief periods of time. The nurse encourages and instructs about meticulous skin hygiene and uses perineal skin cleansers and skin protection products to protect perineal skin. Some patients may benefit from occasional use of foam anal plugs. However, many people find them unacceptable (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gump &#x0026; Schmelzer, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Continence sometimes cannot be achieved, and the nurse assists the patient and family to accept and cope with this chronic situation. Patients with dementia may benefit from toileting assistance, including prompted or timed voiding and habit training, which is the setting of a regular time to go to the bathroom (e.g., after breakfast to have a bowel movement) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gump &#x0026; Schmelzer, 2016</a>). The patient can use fecal incontinence devices, which include external collection devices and internal drainage systems. External devices are special rectal pouches (called <em>fecal incontinence collectors</em>) that are drainable. They are attached to a synthetic adhesive skin barrier specially designed to conform to the buttocks. Designed for patients with chronic, debilitating illnesses (e.g., in long-term care facilities) or acute illnesses, fecal management systems (e.g., Flexi-Seal Fecal Management System) can be used to eliminate fecal skin contact and are especially useful when there is extensive excoriation or skin breakdown. These systems, which consist of a tube with a low-pressure balloon that conforms to the internal rectal area, may be used for short-term management of liquid stools (no more than 4&#x00A0;consecutive weeks) (see <a href="#ff41-1">Fig. 41-1</a>).</p>
