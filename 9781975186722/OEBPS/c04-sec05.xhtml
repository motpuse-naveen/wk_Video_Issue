<h4 class="h4" id="s67">Cultural Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cultural assessment:&lt;/b&gt; a systematic appraisal or examination of individuals, families, groups, and communities in terms of their cultural beliefs, values, and practices">Cultural assessment</button></strong> refers to a systematic appraisal or examination of individuals, families, groups, and communities in terms of their cultural beliefs, values, and practices. Nurses need to ensure that patients of all cultures understand what the nurse is trying to accomplish by gathering cultural data during the assessment process in order to avoid misunderstanding (<a href="#bib280">Holland, 2018</a>). In an effort to establish a database for determining a patient&#x2019;s cultural background, nurses have developed cultural assessment tools or modified existing assessment tools (<a href="#bib240">Leininger, 2002</a>) to ensure that transcultural considerations are included in the plan of care. Giger and Davidhizar&#x2019;s Transcultural Assessment Model can be used to help nurses perform cultural assessments. Questions derived from this model may be used to direct nursing assessment of a person&#x2019;s ethnic, cultural, or religious beliefs and its relationship to their personal and health care traditions (<a href="#ct4-7">Chart&#x00A0;4-7</a>) (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>). In addition, nurses should gather data on patients&#x2019; cultural perceptions and family ancestry throughout the assessment process. Nurses should recognize that advancing knowledge about culturally congruent care is important for promoting care that is consistent with the cultural needs of each patient&#x2019;s heritage (<a href="#bib237">Jakub, Turk, Fapohunda, et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ct4-8">Chart&#x00A0;4-8</a> for a Nursing Research Profile).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s68">Culturally Mediated Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses should be aware that patients act and behave in various ways, in part because of the influence of culture on behaviors and attitudes. However, although certain attributes and attitudes are frequently associated with particular cultural groups, it is important to remember that not all people from the same cultural background share the same behaviors and views. Although nurses who fail to consider patients&#x2019; cultural preferences and beliefs are considered insensitive and possibly indifferent, nurses who assume that all members of any one culture act and behave in the same way run the risk of stereotyping people. As stated previously, the best way to avoid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page92" title="92"></span>stereotyping is to view each patient as a person and to assess the patient&#x2019;s cultural preferences. A thorough cultural assessment using a culture assessment tool or questionnaire can be beneficial.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Cultural Beliefs, Perceptions, and Practices of Adult Children of African Immigrants</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Jakub, K. E., Turk, M. T., Fapohunda, A., et al. (2018). Cultural beliefs, perceptions, and practices of young adult offspring of African immigrants regarding healthy eating and activity. <em>Journal of Transcultural Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>29</em>(6), 548&#x2013;554.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to understand and explore the beliefs, perceptions, and practices of young adult offspring of African immigrants regarding healthy eating and activities in the context of their environment and culture. The researchers also examined what influences the beliefs, perceptions, and practices of the study population.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Using a focused ethnography design, five small group interviews consisting of two to six participants were conducted yielding a total of 20 college-age students who were offspring of African immigrants. Focused group semistructured interviews were digitally recorded during the data collection. Data collection was completed upon determination of data saturation. Leininger&#x2019;s four phases of qualitative data analysis were used to analyze the data.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The 20 participants, between the ages of 18 and 23, reported parental ancestry from eight different countries of the African continent: 11 from Nigeria, 3 from Ghana, and 1 participant each from Ethiopia, Cameroon, Egypt, Sudan, Liberia, and Eritrea. Seventeen categories, six patterns, and four themes emerged from the data. The four themes included (1) family, community, and religious ties to traditional African foods; (2) traditional African cuisine as healthy and American foods as nonhealthy; (3) eating patterns vary according to availability and resources; and (4) exercise patterns have familial, peer-driven, and generational influences significant to this college-age group. Participants also reported balancing acculturation into a university setting. Food choices were influenced by living arrangements, availability, financial resources, and time constraints.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses should assess cultural perceptions and family ancestry that may affect a patient&#x2019;s perceptions of health and activity levels. Advancing knowledge about culturally congruent care is important and may promote healthy behaviors that include better eating habits and activity for college-age offspring of immigrants. Efforts should be made to identify the country of origin of patients and develop educational or health promoting programs to manage wellness specific to each patient&#x2019;s heritage.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Information Disclosure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many aspects of care may be influenced by the diverse cultural perspectives held by health care providers, patients, families, or significant others. One example is the issue of communication and full disclosure. In general, nurses may argue that patients have the right to full disclosure concerning their disease and prognosis and may believe that advocacy means working to provide that disclosure. However, family members in some cultural backgrounds may believe that it is their responsibility to protect and spare the patient (their loved one) knowledge about a terminal illness. In some cultures, the head of the family group, older adult, or husband is expected to receive all information and make decisions. Patients may in fact not want to know about their condition and may expect their family members to &#x201C;take the burden&#x201D; of that knowledge and related decision making. Nurses should not decide that a family or patient is simply wrong or that a patient must know all of the details of their illness regardless of the patient&#x2019;s preference. Similar concerns may be noted when patients refuse pain medication or treatment because of cultural beliefs regarding pain or beliefs in divine intervention or faith healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining the most appropriate and ethical approach to patient care requires an exploration of the cultural aspects of these situations. Self-examination and recognition of one&#x2019;s own cultural bias and worldview play a major part in helping the nurse resolve cultural and ethical conflicts. Nurses must promote open dialogue and work with patients, families, primary providers, and other health care providers to reach the culturally appropriate solution for the individual patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Space and Distance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Personal space is the area that surrounds a person&#x2019;s body and includes the space and the objects within the space (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>). People tend to regard the space in their immediate vicinity as an extension of themselves. The amount of space that they need between themselves and others to feel comfortable is a culturally determined phenomenon.</p>
<p class="indent">Because nurses and patients usually are not consciously aware of their personal space requirements, they frequently have difficulty understanding different behaviors. For example, one patient may perceive the nurse sitting close to them as an expression of warmth and care; another patient may perceive the nurse&#x2019;s act as a threatening invasion of personal space. Research reveals that people from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain require the most personal space between themselves and others, whereas those from Latin America, Japan, and the Middle East need the least amount of space and feel comfortable standing close to others (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient appears to position himself or herself too close or too far away, the nurse should consider cultural preferences for space and distance. Ideally, the patient should be permitted to assume a position that is comfortable to them in terms of personal space and distance. The nurse should be aware that the wheelchair of a person with a disability is considered an extension of the person; therefore, the nurse should ask the person&#x2019;s permission before moving or touching the wheelchair. Because a significant amount of communication during nursing care requires close physical contact, the nurse should be aware that having personal space promotes self-identity by allowing opportunities for patient self-expression (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 93</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page94" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="94">p. 94</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Eye Contact</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Eye contact is also a culturally determined behavior. Although most nurses have been taught to maintain eye contact when speaking with patients, some people from certain cultural backgrounds may interpret this behavior differently. For example, some Asians, Native Americans, Indo-Chinese, Arabs, and Appalachians may consider direct eye contact impolite or aggressive, and they may avert their own eyes when talking with nurses and others whom they perceive to be in positions of authority. Some Native Americans stare at the floor during conversations&#x2014;a cultural behavior conveying respect and indicating that the listener is paying close attention to the speaker. Some Hispanic patients maintain downcast eyes as a sign of culturally appropriate deferential behavior toward others on the basis of age, gender, social position, economic status, and position of authority (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>). Eye contact is an important tool in a transcultural assessment and is used for both observation and to initiate interaction (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>). The nurse who is aware that eye contact may be culturally determined can better understand the patient&#x2019;s behavior and provide an atmosphere in which the patient can feel comfortable.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Time</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Attitudes about time vary widely among cultures and can be a barrier to effective communication between nurses and patients. Views about punctuality and the use of time are culturally determined, as is the concept of waiting. Symbols of time, such as watches, sunrises, and sunsets, represent methods for measuring the duration and passage of time (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For most health care providers, time and promptness are extremely important. For example, nurses frequently expect patients to arrive at an exact time for an appointment, although patients may be kept waiting by health care providers who are running late. Health care providers are likely to function according to an appointment system in which there are short intervals. However, for patients from some cultures, time is a relative phenomenon, with little attention paid to the exact hour or minute. Time may also be determined according to traditional times for meals, sleep, and other activities or events. For people from some cultures, the present is of the greatest importance, and time is viewed in broad ranges rather than in terms of a fixed hour. Being flexible in regard to schedules is the best way to accommodate these differences.</p>
<p class="indent">Value differences also may influence a person&#x2019;s sense of priority when it comes to time. For example, responding to a family matter may be more important to a patient than meeting a scheduled health care appointment. Allowing for these different views is essential in maintaining an effective nurse&#x2013;patient relationship. Scolding or acting annoyed at patients for being late undermines their confidence and may result in further missed appointments or indifference to health care suggestions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Touch</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Touch is the most personal of all sensations, is central to the human communication process, and is often used as a method of communication (<a href="#bib280">Giger, 2016</a>). The meaning that people associate with touching is culturally determined to a great degree. In some cultures (e.g., Hispanic, Arab), male health care providers may be prohibited from touching or examining certain parts of the female body. Similarly, it may be inappropriate for females to care for males. Among many Asians, it is impolite to touch a person&#x2019;s head because the spirit is believed to reside there. Therefore, assessment of the head or evaluation of a head injury requires permission of the patient or a family member, if the patient is not able to give permission.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s culturally defined sense of modesty must also be considered when providing nursing care. For example, some Jewish and Muslim women believe that modesty requires covering their head, arms, and legs with clothing. It is important for the nurse to recognize cultural variances and to understand that touch can be perceived as intrusive to some patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Observance of Holidays</h6>
<p class="nonindent">People from all cultures observe certain civil and religious holidays. Nurses should familiarize themselves with major observances for members of the cultural groups they serve. Information about these observances is available from various sources, including religious organizations, hospital chaplains, and patients themselves. Routine health appointments, diagnostic tests, surgery, and other major procedures should be scheduled to avoid observances that patients identify as significant. If not contraindicated, efforts should also be made to accommodate patients and families or significant others who wish to perform cultural and religious rituals in the health care setting.</p>
