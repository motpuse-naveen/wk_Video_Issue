<h4 class="h4" id="s1523">The Patient with a Cast, Splint, or Brace</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with musculoskeletal trauma typically requires immobilization at some point as part of the management plan. Casts, splints, and braces are external immobilizers that are frequently indicated to treat these injuries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1524">Casts</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cast:&lt;/b&gt; rigid external immobilizing device molded to contours of body part">cast</button></strong> is a rigid external immobilizing device that is molded to the contours of the body. The cast must fit the shape of the injured limb correctly to provide the best support possible (AAOS, 2019c). A cast is used to immobilize a reduced fracture, to correct or prevent a deformity (e.g., clubfoot, hip displacement), apply uniform pressure to underlying soft tissue, or support and stabilize weakened joints. Generally, casts permit mobilization of the patient while restricting movement of the affected body part.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of their ability to provide more complete immobilization, casting is the mainstay of treatment for many fractures as it provides a protected environment for bone healing to occur (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Beutler &#x0026; Titus, 2019</a>). The most common casting materials consist of fiberglass or plaster of Paris, as these are materials that can be molded. The choice of material depends on several factors, which include the condition being treated, availability, and costs. Maximal immobilization is achieved with casts that include the joints proximal and distal to the fracture site (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Alexandre &#x0026; Hodax, 2017</a>). However, with some fractures, cast construction and molding may allow movement of a joint while immobilizing a fracture (e.g., three-point fixation in a patellar tendon weight-bearing cast).</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, casts can be divided into three main groups: arm casts, leg casts, and body or spica casts:</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Short arm cast:</em> Extends from below the elbow to the palmar crease, secured around the base of the thumb. If the thumb is included, it is known as a thumb spica or gauntlet cast.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Long arm cast:</em> Extends from the axillary fold to the proximal palmar crease. The elbow usually is immobilized at a right angle.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Short leg cast:</em> Extends from below the knee to the base of the toes. The foot is flexed at a right angle in a neutral position.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Long leg cast:</em> Extends from the junction of the upper and middle third of the thigh to the base of the toes. The knee may be slightly flexed.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Walking boot:</em> Also called an air or walking cast; protects and supports the foot, ankle or lower leg by controlling alignment and reducing movement; also supports the user&#x2019;s weight while walking.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Body cast:</em> Encircles the trunk.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Shoulder spica cast:</em> A body jacket that encloses the trunk, shoulder, and elbow.</p>
<p class="BL1Middle"><em>Hip spica cast:</em> Encloses the trunk and a lower extremity. A double hip spica cast includes both legs.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#ff37-8">Figure 37-8</a> illustrates long arm and long leg casts and areas in which pressure problems commonly occur with these casts.</p>
<p class="indent">The application of a cast is a specialized skill, typically performed by orthopedic technologists. The skillset needed to apply and remove casts requires education, training, practice, and constant review of provider competence to ensure patients receive safe, high-quality care. Casts that are not properly applied or cared for may hinder healing and predispose patients to a number of complications (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Adib-Hajbaghery &#x0026; Mokhtari, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fiberglass Casts</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fiberglass casts are composed of polyurethane resins that have the versatility of plaster but are lighter in weight, stronger, water resistant, and more durable than plaster. In addition, fiberglass casts facilitate radiographic imaging better than plaster (AAOS, 2019c) and have the benefit of reaching full rigidity within 30 minutes of application. Because they tend to be more difficult to contour and mold, fiberglass casts are more commonly used for simple fractures of the upper and lower extremities. They consist of an open-weave, nonabsorbent fabric that requires tepid water for activation. Heat is given off (an exothermic reaction) while the cast is applied. The heat given off during this reaction can be uncomfortable, and the nurse should prepare the patient for the sensation of increasing warmth so that the patient does not become alarmed. Fiberglass casts can cause thermal injury like plaster casts, but the risk is less (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Beutler &#x0026; Titus, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Some fiberglass casts use a waterproof lining (Gore-Tex), which permits the patient to shower, swim, or engage in hydrotherapy (the use of water for treatment). When the cast is wet, the patient is instructed to remove excess water by blotting or patting the cast with a towel and making sure to drain the water out of it. The patient must understand that thorough drying is important to prevent skin breakdown, infection, or irritation; sweeping motions with a blow dryer on a cool or warm setting for approximately 1 hour can help to dry the cast inside and out (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>). The best results are achieved with casts that can easily drain, such as short arm casts. Heels and elbows encased in wet casts may become macerated from the trapped water and therefore are associated with more skin breakdown.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Plaster Casts</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Casts made of plaster of Paris are less costly and achieve a better mold than fiberglass casts; however, they are heavy, not water resistant, and can take up to 24 to 72 hours to dry postapplication. The exothermic reaction during cast application has the potential to cause serious burns (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Szostakowski, Smitham, &#x0026; Khan, 2017</a>). Extra care should be taken when these types of casts are applied to older adults because their skin is more temperature sensitive than average adult skin. During the cast application process, clean, room temperature water should be used. Minimal layers of padding should be used. In addition, the cast should not be covered while it is drying because the heat generated by the chemical reaction cannot escape.</p>
<p class="indent">The time that it takes for a plaster cast to dry completely depends on its size, thickness, and location, as well as environmental drying conditions (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Nemeth, Halanski, &#x0026; Noonan, 2020</a>). A freshly applied cast should be handled as little as possible to prevent denting and cracking (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>). The wet plaster cast should be handled by only the palms so that indentations in the cast may be prevented; indentations can result in areas of pressure on the skin (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>). The cast should be exposed to circulating air to dry and supported on a firm and smooth surface; it should not be placed on a metallic surface or one with sharp edges. If elevation is requested to reduce swelling, a cloth-covered pillow is preferred to one covered in plastic, which could retain heat and prevent drying. A wet plaster cast feels damp, appears dull and gray, sounds dull on percussion, and smells musty. The cast is dry when it feels hard and firm, has a white and shiny appearance, is resonant to percussion, and odorless.</p>
<p class="indent">On occasion, the plaster cast may have rough edges, which can crumble and cause skin irritation. Petaling, or smoothing the rough edges of the cast, resolves this problem if the underlying stockinette does not cover the edges of the cast. To prevent skin breakdown, moleskin can be used over any rough area of the cast that may rub against the patient&#x2019;s skin.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1525">Splints and Braces</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many injuries that were treated previously with casts may now be treated with other immobilization devices such as splints and braces. Application of a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;splint:&lt;/b&gt; device designed specifically to support and immobilize a body part in a desired position">splint</button></strong> (i.e., a process called splinting) is usually more practical and common and is the preferred method of fracture immobilization in the acute care setting and for the initial treatment of fractures that eventually require casting (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Beutler &#x0026; Titus, 2019</a>). Splints are often used for simple and stable fractures, sprains, tendon injuries, and other soft tissue injuries. They offer many advantages over casts in that they are faster and easier to apply; however, increased joint mobility and decreased patient adherence may be a concern (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Eubanks &#x0026; Chien, 2019</a>). Splints are also noncircumferential and allow for natural swelling during the inflammatory phase of injury. Pressure-related complications (e.g., skin breakdown, necrosis, acute compartment syndrome) are more prevalent when soft tissue swelling occurs within a contained space (e.g., a circumferential cast). Splints are easily removed, facilitating inspection of the injury site. In addition, splints can be indicated to provide initial stability for fractures that are unstable while awaiting definitive care (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schub &#x0026; Balderrama, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Contoured splints of plaster or pliable thermoplastic materials may be used for conditions that do not require rigid immobilization, for those in which swelling may be anticipated, and for those that require special skin care. Splints made of thermoplastics are warmed and molded to custom-fit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1168" title="1168"></span>the affected body part (e.g., hand and thoracolumbosacral orthotics [TLSOs], clamshell-type back braces). The splint needs to immobilize and support the body part in a functional position, and it must be well padded to prevent pressure, skin abrasion, and skin breakdown (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Eubanks &#x0026; Chien, 2019</a>). The splint is overwrapped with an elastic bandage applied in a spiral fashion and with pressure uniformly distributed so that circulation is not restricted.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Braces</strong> (e.g., orthoses) are used to provide support, control movement, and prevent additional injury. They are custom-fitted to various parts of the body; thus, they tend to be indicated for longer-term use than splints. The orthotist adjusts the brace for fit, positioning, and motion so that movement is enhanced, any deformities are corrected, and discomfort is minimized.</p>
<p class="indent">Many splints and braces are prefabricated and fastened with Velcro straps. They may be made of plastic and other materials such as cloth, leather, metal, and elastic. Knee immobilizers, ankle stirrups, and cock-up wrist splints are types of prefabricated splints and braces. Both splints and braces may be either custom-made or standard &#x201C;off the shelf.&#x201D; Splints and braces are generally less compliant and permit more motion at the injury site than casts, which can be a serious disadvantage in that underlying injuries are not as well stabilized (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schub &#x0026; Balderrama, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1526">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Before the cast, splint, or brace is applied, the nurse completes an assessment of the patient&#x2019;s general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding of the need for the device, and condition of the body part to be immobilized (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schub &#x0026; Balderrama, 2017</a>). Physical assessment of the part to be immobilized must include a thorough assessment of the skin and neurovascular status, including the degree and location of swelling, bruising, and skin abrasions (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To promote healing, any skin lacerations and abrasions that may have occurred as a result of the trauma that caused the fracture must be treated before the cast, brace, or splint is applied. The nurse thoroughly cleanses the skin and treats it as prescribed. The patient may require a tetanus booster if the wound is dirty and if the last known booster was given more than 5 years ago. Sterile dressings are used to cover the injured skin. If the skin wounds are extensive, an alternative method (e.g., external fixator) may be chosen to immobilize the body part (AAOS, 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse gives the patient or family information about the underlying pathologic condition and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. This knowledge promotes the patient&#x2019;s active participation in and adherence to the treatment program.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse prepares the patient for the application of the cast, splint, or brace by describing the anticipated sights, sounds, and sensations (e.g., heat from the hardening reaction of the fiberglass or plaster) that they may experience (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2642">Chinai, Walker, Rebesco, et al., 2019</a>). Asking the patient and family what they know about the application and care of the cast can help determine opportunities for education. The patient needs to know what to expect during application and the reason the body part must be immobilized.</p>
<p class="indent">The main concern following the application of an immobilization device is assessment and prevention of neurovascular dysfunction or compromise of the affected extremity. Assessments are performed at least every hour for the first 24 hours and every 1 to 4 hours thereafter to prevent neurovascular compromise related to edema and/or the device. Neurovascular assessment includes the assessment of peripheral circulation, motion, and sensation of the affected extremity, assessing the fingers or toes of the affected extremity, and comparing them with those of the opposite extremity. When assessing peripheral circulation, the nurse must check peripheral pulses as well as capillary refill response (within 3 seconds), edema, and the color and temperature of the skin. While assessing motion, the nurse should note any weakness or paralysis of the injured body part. While assessing sensation, the nurse monitors for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;paresthesia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal sensation (e.g., burning, tingling, numbness)">paresthesia</button></strong> (i.e., numbness or tingling) or absence of feeling in the affected extremity, which could indicate nerve damage (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schub &#x0026; Balderrama, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses must be vigilant in assessing for subtle neurovascular changes in these patients (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schub &#x0026; Balderrama, 2017</a>). The &#x201C;5 Ps&#x201D; indicative of symptoms of neurovascular compromise, described previously, including <strong><em>p</em></strong>ain, <strong><em>p</em></strong>allor, <strong><em>p</em></strong>ulselessness, <strong><em>p</em></strong>aresthesia, and <strong><em>p</em></strong>aralysis, are assessed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Papachristos &#x0026; Giannoudis, 2018</a>). Early recognition of diminished circulation and nerve function is essential to prevent loss of function. Swelling is a concern and can create excessive pressure under the cast (AAOS, 2019c). To augment the flow of fluid, the nurse elevates the extremity so that it is above the level of the heart during the first 24 to 48 hours postapplication to enhance arterial perfusion and control edema and notifies the primary provider at once if signs of compromised neurovascular status are present.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must carefully evaluate pain associated with the musculoskeletal condition, asking the patient to indicate the exact site and to describe the character and intensity of the pain using a pain rating scale (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). Pain associated with the underlying condition (e.g., fracture) is frequently controlled by immobilization. Pain due to edema that is associated with trauma, surgery, or bleeding into the tissues can frequently be controlled by elevation and, if prescribed, intermittent application of ice or cold packs (AAOS, 2019c). Ice bags (one third to one half full) or cold application devices are placed on each side of the cast, if prescribed, making sure not to indent or wet the cast. Unrelieved or pain out of proportion following cast application may indicate complications. Pain associated with acute compartment syndrome (see previous discussion) is relentless and is not controlled by modalities such as elevation, application of ice or cold, and usual dosages of analgesic agents. Severe burning pain over bony prominences, especially the heels, anterior ankles, and elbows, warns of an impending pressure injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Chinai et al., 2019</a>). This may also occur from too-tight elastic wraps used to hold splints in place.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse must never ignore complaints of pain from the patient in a cast because of the possibility of problems, such as impaired tissue perfusion, acute compartment syndrome or pressure injury formation. A patient&#x2019;s unrelieved pain and increasing analgesic requirements must be reported immediately to the primary provider to avoid necrosis, neuromuscular damage, and possible paralysis.</em></p></div>

<p class="indent">The nurse observes the patient for systemic signs of infection, which include an unpleasant odor from the cast, splint, or brace, and purulent drainage staining the cast. Infection is more common from an open wound, but the moist, warm environment of a splint or cast can be an ideal conduit for infection. Foul-smelling casts should be removed to prevent skin and wound infections (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Nemeth et al., 2020</a>). If the infection progresses, a fever may develop. The nurse must notify the primary provider if any of these signs occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, some degree of joint stiffness is an inevitable complication of immobilization. Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its ROM to maintain function. The nurse encourages the patient to move all fingers or toes hourly when awake to stimulate circulation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to assess for potential complications resulting from casts, splints, and braces that can be serious and life-threatening, such as acute compartment syndrome, pressure injury formation, and disuse syndrome.</p>
<p class="h7">Acute Compartment Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">Acute compartment syndrome&#x2014;the most serious complication of casting and splinting&#x2014;occurs when increased pressure within a confined space (e.g., cast, muscle compartment) compromises blood flow and tissue perfusion (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schub &#x0026; Balderrama, 2017</a>). Ischemia and potentially irreversible damage to the soft tissues within that space can occur within a few hours if action is not taken (see <a href="c37-sec04.xhtml#ff37-4">Fig. 37-4</a>). A tight or rigid cast/splint that constricts a swollen limb is associated with this complication.</p>
<p class="indent">If the complication is due to a cast or tight splint, the splint may be loosened or removed and the cast univalved or bivalved (cut in half longitudinally, on one side or two parallel sides of the cast, respectively) to release constriction and allow for inspection of the skin (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Nemeth et al., 2020</a>). The nurse assists in maintaining limb alignment, and the extremity must then be elevated no higher than heart level to maintain arterial perfusion. If pressure is not relieved and circulation is not restored, an emergent surgical fasciotomy may be necessary to relieve the pressure within the muscle compartment. The nurse closely monitors the patient&#x2019;s response to conservative and surgical management of compartment syndrome. The nurse records frequent neurovascular responses and promptly reports changes to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="h7">Pressure Injuries</p>
<p class="nonindent">Casts or splints can put pressure on soft tissues, particularly if they are inappropriately applied, causing tissue anoxia and pressure injuries. Although the term pressure ulcer has been previously used, the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (2019) currently considers pressure injury the best term to use, given that open ulceration does not always occur. Lower extremity sites most susceptible are the heel, malleoli, dorsum of the foot, head of the fibula, and anterior surface of the patella. The main pressure sites on the upper extremity are located at the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the ulnar styloid (see <a href="#ff37-8">Fig. 37-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If pressure necrosis occurs, the patient typically reports a very painful &#x201C;hot spot&#x201D; and tightness under the cast. The cast may feel warmer in the affected area, suggesting underlying tissue erythema (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Beutler &#x0026; Titus, 2019</a>). Drainage may stain the cast or splint and emit an unpleasant odor. Even if discomfort does not occur, there may still be extensive loss of tissue with skin breakdown and tissue necrosis. To assess for pressure injury development, the primary provider may univalve, bivalve, or cut an opening (window) in the cast to allow for inspection, access, and possible treatment (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Szostakowski et al., 2017</a>). A dressing may be applied over the exposed skin, and the cutout portion of the cast is replaced and held in place by an elastic compression dressing or tape. This prevents &#x201C;window edema&#x201D; from occurring, which is the swelling or bulging of the underlying soft tissue through the window opening.</p>
<p class="h7">Disuse Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">Immobilization in a cast, splint, or brace can cause muscle atrophy and loss of strength, and can place patients at risk for disuse syndrome, which is the deterioration of body systems as a result of prescribed or unavoidable musculoskeletal inactivity. To prevent this, the nurse instructs the patient to tense or contract muscles (e.g., isometric muscle contraction) without moving the underlying bone (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Arora, Erosa, &#x0026; Danesh, 2019</a>). Isometric exercises, such as instructing the patient with a leg or arm cast to splint or brace to &#x201C;push down&#x201D; the knee or to &#x201C;make a fist,&#x201D; respectively, helps reduce muscle atrophy and maintain strength. Muscle setting exercises (e.g., quadriceps and gluteal setting exercises) are important in maintaining muscles essential for walking (see <a href="#ct37-4">Chart 37-4</a>). Isometric exercises should be performed hourly while the patient is awake.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt="icon" /> Educating the Patient About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Self-care deficits occur when a portion of the body is immobilized. The nurse encourages the patient to participate actively in personal care and to use assistive devices safely. The nurse <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1170" title="1170"></span>must assist the patient in identifying areas of self-care deficit and in developing strategies to achieve independence in ADLs (see <a href="#ct37-5">Chart 37-5</a>). Participating in self-care activities can have a positive effect on patient&#x2019;s knowledge and physical and psychological health (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2742">Khorais, Ebraheim, &#x0026; Barakat, 2018</a>).

<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">For the patient with a cast that is ready for removal, the nurse should provide an explanation about what to expect, as the patient may be apprehensive about the procedure due to noise and vibration from the electric saw and fear of being cut (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>). The cast saw uses an oscillating blade that vibrates but does not spin; thus, it cuts through the outer cast layer but does not penetrate deeply enough to injure the patient&#x2019;s skin. The cast will be cut in several places, usually along both sides of the cast. The cast is then spread and opened, and a special tool is used to lift it off. Scissors are used to cut through the protective padding and stockinette layers to ensure that the patient&#x2019;s skin will not be cut.</p>
<p class="indent">The formerly immobilized body part will be weak from disuse, stiff, and may appear atrophied. As the cast or splint is removed, the affected body part should be supported to prevent injury. The skin, which is usually dry and scaly from accumulated dead skin, is vulnerable to injury from scratching. The extremity is soaked in warm water to soften the skin; a warm washcloth may be used to loosen dead skin and an emollient lotion may be used as lubrication (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mains, 2017</a>). The patient should be instructed to avoid rubbing and scratching the skin, because doing so can cause damage to newly exposed skin.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse and physical therapist educate the patient to resume activities gradually within the prescribed therapeutic regimen. Exercises prescribed to help the patient restore muscle strength, joint motion, and flexibility are explained and demonstrated. Because the muscles are weak from disuse, the body part that has been immobilized cannot withstand normal stresses immediately. In addition, the patient should be instructed to control swelling by elevating the formerly immobilized body part, no higher than the heart, until normal muscle tone and use are reestablished (AAOS, 2019c).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1527">Nursing Management of the Patient with an Immobilized Upper Extremity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient whose arm is immobilized must readjust to many routine tasks. The unaffected arm will assume all upper extremity activities. The nurse, in consultation with an occupational therapist, suggests devices designed to aid one-handed activities. The patient may experience fatigue due to modified activities and the weight of the cast, splint, or brace. Frequent rest periods are necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">To control swelling, the immobilized arm is elevated above heart level with a pillow. When the patient is lying down, the arm is elevated so that each joint is positioned higher than the preceding proximal joint (e.g., elbow higher than the shoulder, hand higher than the elbow).</p>
<p class="indent">A sling may be used when the patient ambulates. To prevent pressure on the cervical spinal nerves, the sling should distribute the supported weight over a large area of the shoulders and trunk, not just the back of the neck. The nurse encourages the patient to remove the arm from the sling and elevate it frequently.</p>

<p class="indent">Circulatory disturbances in the hand may become apparent with signs of cyanosis, swelling, and an inability to move the fingers. A missed acute compartment syndrome in the arm can result in a Volkmann ischemic contracture, which may lead to devastating impairment of motor function and sensibility (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Rubinstein, Ahmed, &#x0026; Vosbikian, 2018</a>). Contracture of the fingers and wrist occurs as the result of obstructed arterial blood flow to the forearm and hand. The patient is unable to extend the fingers, describes abnormal sensation (e.g., unrelenting pain, pain on passive stretch), and exhibits signs of diminished circulation to the hand. Irreversible damage develops within a few hours if action is not taken. This serious complication can be prevented with nursing surveillance and proper care (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2652">Ferla, Ciravegna, Mariani, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1528">Nursing Management of the Patient with an Immobilized Lower Extremity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The application of a leg cast, splint, or brace imposes a degree of immobility on the patient. Casts may include short leg casts, extending to the knees, or long leg casts, extending to the groin. Hinged knee braces and immobilizers typically extend from ankle to groin.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s leg must be supported on pillows to the level of the heart to control swelling. Cold therapy or ice packs should be applied as prescribed over the fracture site for 1 to 2 days. The patient is taught to elevate the immobilized leg when seated. The patient should also assume a recumbent position several times a day with the immobilized leg elevated to promote venous return and control swelling (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Rasmussen, 2019</a>). Gentle toe and ankle exercises that allow for isometric contraction of muscles beneath the cast have also been shown to increase venous return and diminish edema (AAOS, 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses circulation by observing the color, temperature, and capillary refill of the exposed toes. Nerve function is assessed by observing the patient&#x2019;s ability to move the toes and by asking about the sensations in the foot. Numbness, tingling, and burning may indicate peroneal nerve injury resulting from pressure at the head of the fibula.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Injury to the peroneal nerve as a result of pressure is a cause of footdrop (the inability to maintain the foot in a normally flexed position). Consequently, the patient drags the foot when ambulating.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The nurse and physical therapist instruct the patient how to transfer and ambulate safely with assistive devices (e.g., crutches, walker) (see <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). The gait to be used depends on whether the patient is permitted to bear weight. If weight bearing is allowed, the cast, splint, or brace is reinforced to withstand the body weight. A cast boot or shoe, which is worn over the casted foot, provides a broad, nonskid walking surface.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1529">Nursing Management of the Patient with a Body or Spica Cast</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Casts that encase the trunk of the body (body cast) and portions of one or two extremities (spica cast) require special nursing strategies. Body casts are used to immobilize the spine. Hip spica casts are utilized to treat various fractures of the hip or femur or to correct or maintain the correction of hip deformities after reduction or surgery. These casts typically remain in place for 4 to 6 weeks (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Nemeth et al., 2020</a>). Shoulder spica casts are used for some humeral neck fractures.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing responsibilities include preparing and positioning the patient, assisting with skin care and hygiene, and monitoring for complications. Explaining the casting procedure helps reduce the patient&#x2019;s apprehension about being encased in a large cast. The nurse reassures the patient that several people will provide care during the application, support for the injured area will be adequate, and care providers will be as gentle as possible. Patients immobilized in large casts may develop superior mesenteric artery syndrome, also known as cast syndrome, a rare condition characterized by compression of the third portion of the duodenum between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Karrer &#x0026; Jones, 2018</a>). A partial or complete obstruction of the duodenum can occur within days or weeks after the cast has been applied and includes psychological or physiologic manifestations. The psychological component is similar to a claustrophobic reaction. The patient exhibits an acute anxiety reaction characterized by behavioral changes and autonomic responses (e.g., increased respiratory rate, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure). The nurse needs to recognize the anxiety reaction and provide an environment in which the patient feels secure. The administration of pain and antianxiety medications prior to the casting procedure may help to reduce this reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">With decreased physical activity, gastrointestinal motility decreases, and intestinal gases accumulate. Physiologic manifestations include abdominal distention and discomfort, nausea, and bilious vomiting, which can lead to food aversion, poor intake, malnourishment, and weight loss (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2777">Rai, Shah, Palliyil, et al., 2019</a>). Eventually, increased abdominal pressure and ileus may occur. As with other instances of adynamic ileus, the patient is treated conservatively with decompression (nasogastric intubation connected to suction) and IV fluid therapy until gastrointestinal motility is restored. If conservative measures are ineffective, surgical intervention is warranted. Rarely, the abdominal distention can place added pressure on the superior mesenteric artery, reducing the blood supply to the bowel, which can result in gangrenous bowel. The descending aorta may also sustain pressure, as it may be compressed between the spine and pressure of abdominal distention, which results in ischemia. These complications can be severe, and the pressure needs to be relieved as soon as possible by cutting a window in the abdominal portion of the cast or bivalving the cast; these measures may be sufficient to prevent or relieve pressure on the duodenum.</p>

<p class="indent">Caring for a patient with a body or spica cast at home can be very stressful for the caregiver(s); therefore, it is essential <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1172" title="1172"></span>that nurses provide appropriate support and discharge education. To minimize complications after the cast is applied, the nurse should give the patient a comprehensive discharge package that supplements home care instructions with visual training instructions, as well as provide telephone counseling after discharge (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Schweich, 2019</a>). Specifically, the nurse educates the family about how to care for the patient, including providing hygienic, cast and skin care, proper positioning, preventing complications, and recognizing symptoms that should be reported to the primary provider.</p>
