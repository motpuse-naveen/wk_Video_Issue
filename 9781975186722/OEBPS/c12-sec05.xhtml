<h4 class="h4" id="s382">Management of Cancer</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment options offered to patients with cancer are based on treatment goals for each specific type, stage, and grade of cancer. The range of possible treatment goals includes cure, a complete eradication of malignant disease; control, which includes prolonged survival and containment of cancer cell growth; or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;palliation:&lt;/b&gt; relief of symptoms and promotion of comfort and quality of life regardless of the disease stage">palliation</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, which involves relief of symptoms associated with the disease and improvement of quality of life. Treatment approaches are not initiated until the diagnosis of cancer has been confirmed and staging and grading have been completed.</p>
<p class="indent">The health care team and the patient and family must have a clear understanding of the treatment options and goals. Open communication and support are vital as those involved periodically reassess treatment plans and goals when complications of therapy develop or disease progresses.</p>
<p class="indent">Multiple modalities are commonly used in cancer treatment. Various approaches, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), immunotherapy, and targeted therapy may be used together or at different times throughout treatment. Understanding the principles of each and how they interrelate is important in understanding the rationale and goals of treatment.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s383">Surgery</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical removal of the entire cancer remains the ideal and most frequently used treatment method. However, the specific surgical approach may vary for several reasons. Diagnostic surgery is the definitive method for obtaining tissue to identify the cellular characteristics that influence all treatment decisions. Surgery may be the primary method of treatment, or it may be prophylactic, palliative, or reconstructive.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s384">Diagnostic Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnostic surgery, or biopsy, is performed to obtain a tissue sample for histologic analysis of cells suspected to be malignant. In most instances, the biopsy is taken from the actual tumor; however, in some situations, it is necessary to take a sample of lymph nodes near a suspicious tumor. Many cancers can metastasize from the primary site to other areas of the body through the lymphatic circulation. Knowing whether adjacent lymph nodes contain tumor cells helps the health <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page313" title="313"></span>care team plan the best therapeutic approach to combat cancer that has spread beyond the primary tumor site. The use of injectable dyes and nuclear medicine imaging can help identify the sentinel lymph node or the initial lymph node to which the primary tumor and surrounding tissue drain. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), also known as sentinel lymph node mapping, is a minimally invasive surgical approach that in many instances has replaced lymphadenectomy (more invasive lymph node dissections) and the associated complications such as lymphedema and delayed healing. SLNB has been widely adopted for regional lymph node staging in selected cases of melanoma and breast cancer (NCCN, 2019d, 2019e).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Biopsy Types</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Biopsy methods include excisional, incisional, and needle biopsy. The biopsy type is determined by the size and location of the tumor, the type of treatment anticipated if the cancer diagnosis is confirmed, and the need for surgery and general anesthesia. The biopsy method that allows for the least invasive approach while permitting the most representative tissue sample is chosen. Diagnostic imaging techniques can be used to assist in locating the suspicious lesion and to facilitate accurate tissue sampling. The patient and family are provided the opportunity and time to discuss the options before definitive plans are made.</p>
<p class="indent">Excisional biopsy is used for small, easily accessible tumors. In many cases, the surgeon can remove the entire tumor as well as the surrounding marginal tissues. The removal of normal tissue beyond the tumor area decreases the possibility that residual microscopic malignant cells may lead to a recurrence of the tumor. This approach not only provides the pathologist with the entire tissue specimen for the determination of stage and grade but also decreases the chance of seeding tumor cells (disseminating cancer cells throughout surrounding tissues).</p>
<p class="indent">Incisional biopsy is performed if the tumor mass is too large to be removed. In this case, a wedge of tissue from the tumor is removed for analysis. The cells of the tissue wedge must be representative of the tumor mass so that the pathologist can provide an accurate diagnosis. If the specimen does not contain representative tissue and cells, negative biopsy results do not guarantee the absence of cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Excisional and incisional approaches are often performed through endoscopy. However, a surgical procedure may be required to determine the anatomic extent or stage of the tumor. For example, a diagnostic or staging laparotomy (the surgical opening of the abdomen to assess malignant abdominal disease) may be necessary to assess malignancies such as gastric or colon cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Needle biopsy is performed to sample suspicious masses that are easily and safely accessible, such as some masses in the breasts, thyroid, lung, liver, and kidney. Needle biopsies are most often performed on an outpatient basis. They are fast, relatively inexpensive, easy to perform, and may require only local anesthesia. In general, the patient experiences slight and temporary physical discomfort. In addition, the surrounding tissues are minimally disturbed, thus decreasing the likelihood of seeding cancer cells. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy involves aspirating cells rather than intact tissue through a needle that is guided into a suspected diseased area. This type of specimen can only be analyzed by cytologic examination (viewing only cells, not tissue). Often, x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scanning, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to help locate the suspicious area and guide placement of the needle. FNA does not always yield enough material to permit accurate diagnosis, necessitating additional biopsy procedures. A core needle biopsy uses a specially designed needle to obtain a small core of tissue that permits histologic analysis. Most often, this specimen is sufficient to permit accurate diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s385">Surgery as Primary Treatment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When surgery is the primary approach in treating cancer, the goal is to remove the entire tumor or as much as is feasible (a procedure sometimes called <em>debulking</em>) as well as any involved surrounding tissue, including regional lymph nodes.</p>
<p class="indent">Two common surgical approaches used for treating primary tumors are local and wide excisions. Local excision, often performed on an outpatient basis, is warranted when the mass is small. It includes removal of the mass and a small margin of normal tissue that is easily accessible. Wide or radical excisions (en bloc dissections) include removal of the primary tumor, lymph nodes, adjacent involved structures, and surrounding tissues that may be at high risk for tumor spread. This surgical method may result in disfigurement and altered functioning, necessitating rehabilitation, reconstructive procedures, or both. However, wide excisions are considered if the tumor can be removed completely and the chances of cure or control are good.</p>
<p class="indent">Minimally invasive surgical techniques are increasingly replacing traditional surgery associated with large incisions for a variety of cancers (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro, Wujcik, &#x0026; Gobel, 2018</a>). Advantages of minimally invasive approaches include less surgical trauma, decreased blood loss, decreased incidence of wound infection and other complications associated with surgery, decreased surgical time and requirement for anesthesia, decreased postoperative pain and limited mobility, and shorter periods of recovery (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1032">Pache, H&#x00FC;bner, Jurt, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Endoscopic surgery, an example of minimally invasive surgery, uses an endoscope with intense lighting and an attached multichip mini camera that is inserted into the body through a small incision. The surgical instruments are inserted into the surgical field through one or two additional small incisions, each about 1 to 2 cm in length. The camera transmits the image of the involved area to a monitor so that the surgeon can manipulate the instruments to perform the necessary procedure. Endoscopic surgery is used to treat many cancer-related conditions of the thorax (thoracoscopy) and abdomen (laparoscopy).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of robotics is another advancement in the surgical treatment of cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib937">Yarbro, et al., 2018</a>). The use of robotics during laparoscopic procedures permits the removal of tumors with more precision and dexterity than could be accomplished by laparoscopic surgery alone. Laparoscopic robotic-assisted surgery has been used to treat cancers of the colon, prostate and uterus; however, it remains unclear if long-term cancer-related outcomes are improved with robotic surgery when compared to more conventional surgical approaches (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Salvage surgery is an additional treatment option that uses an extensive surgical approach to treat the local <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page314" title="314"></span>recurrence of cancer after the use of a less extensive primary approach. Mastectomy to treat recurrent breast cancer after primary lumpectomy and radiation is an example of salvage surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery may completely excise limited areas of metastatic disease (referred to as oligometastatic disease) as well. An example would be colon cancer with one to three small areas of liver metastasis and no evidence of cancer elsewhere. In the past, patients with recurrent or metastatic disease were treated with palliation only as their disease was considered incurable. However, evidence now suggests that there is a possibility of a cure or prolonged survival for select subgroups of patients with certain cancer types (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib987">Jang, Kim, Jeong, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1039">Ruiz, Sebagh, Wicherts, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to surgery that uses surgical blades or scalpels to excise the mass and surrounding tissues, several other types of techniques are available. <a href="#tt12-5">Table&#x00A0;12-5</a> provides examples of select techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">A multidisciplinary approach to patient care is essential for the patient undergoing cancer-related surgery. The effects of surgery on the patient&#x2019;s body image, self-esteem, and functional abilities are addressed. If necessary, a plan for postoperative rehabilitation is made before the surgery is performed. The growth and dissemination of cancer cells may have produced distant micrometastases by the time the patient seeks treatment. Therefore, attempting to remove wide margins of tissue in the hope of &#x201C;getting all the cancer&#x201D; may not be feasible. This reality substantiates the need for a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to cancer therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the surgery has been completed, one or more additional (or adjuvant) modalities may be chosen to increase the likelihood of eradicating the remaining microscopic cancer cells that are undetectable by available diagnostic procedures. However, some cancers that are treated surgically in the very early stages (e.g., skin and testicular cancers) are curable without additional therapy.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s386">Prophylactic Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prophylactic or risk reduction surgery involves removing nonvital tissues or organs that are at increased risk of developing cancer. The following factors are considered when discussing possible prophylactic surgery:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Family history and genetic predisposition</span></li>
<li><span>Presence or absence of signs and symptoms</span></li>
<li><span>Potential risks and benefits</span></li>
<li><span>Ability to detect cancer at an early stage</span></li>
<li><span>Alternative options for managing increased risk</span></li>
<li><span>The patient&#x2019;s acceptance of the postoperative outcome</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Colectomy, mastectomy, and oophorectomy are examples of prophylactic surgeries. Identification of genetic markers indicative of inherited cancer syndromes or a predisposition to develop some types of cancer plays a role in decisions concerning prophylactic surgeries. However, what is adequate justification for prophylactic surgery remains controversial. For example, several factors are considered when deciding to proceed with a prophylactic mastectomy, including a family history of breast cancer; positive <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> findings; severity of overall breast cancer risk; a personal history of breast cancer; and individual factors (e.g., younger age, psychological well-being that may influence the patient&#x2019;s decision making process) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Chagpar, 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1041">Schott, Vetter, Keller, et al., 2017</a>). Prophylactic surgery is discussed with patients and families along with other approaches for managing increased risk of cancer development. Preoperative education and counseling, as well as long-term follow-up, are provided.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s387">Palliative Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The overall goal of palliative surgery in cancer care is to relieve symptoms and to improve the patient&#x2019;s quality of life (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Fahy, 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Hanna, Blazer, &#x0026; Mosca, 2012</a>). Palliative surgery is often performed in an attempt to relieve symptoms such as ulceration, obstruction, hemorrhage, pain, and malignant effusions (see <a href="#tt12-6">Table&#x00A0;12-6</a>). When surgical cure is not possible, honest and informative communication with the patient and family about the goal of palliative surgery is essential to avoid false hope and disappointment. In certain cases, however, surgical intervention with palliative intent may also be performed as a supportive treatment to relieve symptoms along with other potentially curative cancer treatments (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Fahy, 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Hanna et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the role of palliative surgery today is no longer limited to end-of-life care.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s388">Reconstructive Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Reconstructive surgery may follow curative or extensive surgery in an attempt to improve function or obtain a more desirable cosmetic effect. It may be performed in one operation or in stages. The surgeon who will perform the surgery discusses possible reconstructive surgical options with the patient before the primary surgery is performed. Reconstructive surgery may be indicated for breast, head and neck, and skin cancers.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s needs and the impact that altered functioning and body image may have on quality of life. Nurses provide patients and families with opportunities to discuss these issues. The individual needs of the patient undergoing reconstructive surgery and their families must be accurately recognized and addressed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s389">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients undergoing surgery for cancer require general perioperative nursing care (see <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapters 14</a>, <a href="c15.xhtml">15</a>, and <a href="c16.xhtml">16</a>). Surgical care is individualized according to age, organ impairment, specific deficits, comorbidities, cultural implications, and altered immunity. Combining other treatment methods, such as radiation and chemotherapy, with surgery also contributes to postoperative complications, such as infection, impaired wound healing, altered pulmonary or renal function, and the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The nurse completes a thorough preoperative assessment for factors that may affect the patient undergoing the surgical procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperatively, the nurse provides the patient and family with verbal and written information about the surgical procedure as well as other interventions that may take place intraoperatively (e.g., radiation implants). Instructions concerning prophylactic antibiotic requirements, diet, and bowel preparation are also provided.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are undergoing surgery for the diagnosis or treatment of cancer may be anxious about the surgical procedure, possible findings, postoperative limitations, changes in normal body functions, and prognosis. The patient and family require time and assistance to process this information, possible changes, and expected outcomes resulting from the surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse serves as the patient advocate and liaison and encourages the patient and family to take an active role in decision making when possible. If the patient or family asks about the results of diagnostic testing and surgical procedures, the nurse&#x2019;s response is guided by the information that was conveyed previously. The nurse may be asked to explain and clarify information for patients and families that was provided initially but was not grasped because of intense anxiety. It is important that the nurse, as well as other members of the health care team, provide information that is consistent.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperatively, the nurse assesses patient responses to surgery and monitors the patient for possible complications, such as infection, bleeding, thrombophlebitis, wound dehiscence, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and organ dysfunction. The nurse also provides for the patient&#x2019;s comfort. Postoperative education addresses wound care, pain management, activity, nutrition, and medication information.</p>
<p class="indent">Plans for discharge, follow-up, home care, and subsequent treatment and rehabilitation are initiated as early as possible to ensure continuity of care from hospital to home or from a cancer referral center to the patient&#x2019;s local hospital and health care provider. Patients and families are encouraged to use community resources such as the ACS for support and information (see the Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s390">Radiation Therapy</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 60% of patients with cancer receive <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;radiation therapy:&lt;/b&gt; the use of ionizing radiation to kill malignant cells">radiation therapy</button></strong> at some point during treatment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib924">Halperin, Wazer, Perez, et al., 2019</a>). Radiation may be used to cure cancer, as in thyroid carcinomas, localized cancers of the head and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page316" title="316"></span>neck, and cancers of the cervix. Radiation therapy may also be used to control cancer when a tumor cannot be removed surgically or when local nodal metastasis is present. Neoadjuvant (prior to local definitive treatment) radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, is used to reduce tumor size in order to facilitate surgical resection. Radiation therapy may be given prophylactically to prevent local recurrence or spread of microscopic cells from the primary tumor to a distant area (e.g., irradiating the breast and axilla following lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer). Palliative radiation therapy is used to relieve the symptoms of locally advanced or metastatic disease, especially when the cancer has spread to the brain, bone, or soft tissue, or to treat oncologic emergencies, such as superior vena cava syndrome, bronchial airway obstruction, or spinal cord compression.</p>
<p class="indent">Two types of ionizing radiation&#x2014;electromagnetic radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) and particulate radiation (electrons, beta particles, protons, neutrons, and alpha particles)&#x2014;can be used to kill cells. The most lethal damage is the direct alteration of the DNA molecule within the cells of both malignant and normal tissues. Ionizing radiation can directly break the strands of the DNA helix, leading to cell death. It can also indirectly damage DNA through the formation of free radicals. If the DNA cannot be repaired, the cell may die immediately or may initiate apoptosis (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Replicating cells are most vulnerable to the disruptive effects of radiation (during DNA synthesis and mitosis, e.g., early S, G<sub>2</sub>, and M phases of the cell cycle; see <a href="#ff12-2">Fig.&#x00A0;12-2</a>). Therefore, those body tissues that undergo frequent cell division are most sensitive to radiation therapy. These tissues include bone marrow, lymphatic tissue, epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, hair follicles, and gonads. Slower-growing tissues and tissues at rest (e.g., muscle, cartilage, nervous system, connective tissues) are relatively radioresistant (less sensitive to the effects of radiation). However, it is important to remember that radiation therapy is localized treatment, and only the tissues that are within the treatment field are affected.</p>
<p class="indent">A radiosensitive tumor is one that can be destroyed by a dose of radiation that still allows for cell repair and regeneration in the surrounding normal tissue. If the radiation is delivered when most tumor cells are cycling through the cell cycle, the number of cancer cells destroyed (cell kill) is maximal. Radiation sensitivity is enhanced in tumors that are smaller in size and that contain cells that are rapidly dividing (highly proliferative) and poorly differentiated (no longer resembling the tissue of origin).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s391">Radiation Dosage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The radiation dosage depends on the sensitivity of the target tissues to radiation, the size of the tumor, radiation tolerance of the surrounding normal tissues, and critical structures adjacent to the tumor target. The lethal tumor dose is defined as the dose that will eradicate 95% of the tumor yet preserve normal tissue. In external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), the total radiation dose is delivered over several weeks in daily doses called <em>fractions.</em> This allows healthy tissue to repair and achieves greater cell kill by exposing more cells to the radiation as they begin active cell division. Repeated radiation treatments over time (fractionated doses) also allow for the periphery of the tumor to be reoxygenated repeatedly, because tumors shrink from the outside inward. This increases <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page317" title="317"></span>the radiosensitivity of the tumor, thereby increasing tumor cell death (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib930">Morgan, Ten Haken, &#x0026; Lawrence, 2018</a>). Newer approaches take advantage of increased radiation beam conformality (better tumor targeting) to administer radiation in fewer doses with larger fractions sizes (hypo-fractionation and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT]).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Radiation therapy can be given in various ways depending on the source of radiation used, the location of the tumor, and the type of cancer. The primary radiotherapy modalities include EBRT, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;brachytherapy:&lt;/b&gt; delivery of radiation therapy through internal implants placed inside or adjacent to the tumor">brachytherapy</button></strong> (a form of internal radiation), systemic (radioisotopes), and contact or surface molds.</p>
<h6 class="h6">External Radiation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">EBRT is the most commonly used form of radiation therapy. The energy utilized in EBRT is generated either from a linear accelerator or from a unit that generates energy directly from a core source of radioactive material such as a GammaKnife<sup>TM</sup> unit. Through computerized software programs, both approaches can shape an invisible beam of highly charged photons or gamma rays to penetrate the body and target the tumor with pinpoint accuracy.</p>
<p class="indent">Advances in computer technology allow multiple imaging modalities (CT, MRI, and PET scans) to be used to provide three-dimensional images of the tumor, neighboring tissues at risk for microscopic spread, and surrounding normal tissues or organs at risk for radiation-induced injury. These images, referred to as volumetric images, allow the radiation oncologist to plan for multiple radiation beams directed from different angles and different planes so that the beams conform precisely around the tumor (referred to as conformal radiation). The dose of radiation that reaches the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, leading to much less tissue injury than in older forms of radiation therapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>). Treatment enhancements in EBRT include the ability to control different intensity or energy levels of radiation beams at different angles directed at the tumor, a process known as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which enables higher doses to be delivered to the tumor while sparing the important healthy structures surrounding the tumor (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>). IMRT can be given as standard daily fractions or as &#x201C;hyperfractionated&#x201D; twice-daily fractions, which shortens the duration of the patient&#x2019;s treatment schedule. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) uses continuous monitoring of the tumor with ultrasound, x-ray, or CT scans during the treatment to allow for automatic adjustment of the beams as the tumor changes shape or position in an effort to spare the healthy surrounding tissue and reduce side effects. Additional treatment enhancements include respiratory gating, where the treatment delivery is synchronized with the patient&#x2019;s respiratory cycle, enabling the beam to be adjusted as the tumor or organ moves. These treatment advancements improve tumor destruction while reducing acute and long-term toxicities (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Gamma rays generated from the spontaneous decay of naturally occurring solid source of radioactivity, such as cobalt-60, are one of the oldest forms of EBRT. With the advent of modern linear accelerators, the use of solid radioactive elements is confined primarily to the GammaKnife<sup>TM</sup> stereotactic radiosurgery unit, which is used as a one-time, high-dose delivery of EBRT for treatment of both benign and malignant intracranial lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">SBRT is another form of EBRT that uses higher doses of radiation to penetrate very deeply into the body to control deep-seated tumors that cannot be treated by other approaches such as surgery. SBRT is delivered with considerably higher treatment fraction doses over a short span of time, usually 1 to 5 treatment days, in contrast to daily treatments for 5 days per week for 6 to 8 weeks for conventional EBRT. Specialized linear accelerators with the capability of robotically moving around the patient are used to deliver SBRT, such as the CyberKnife<sup>TM</sup>, Trilogy<sup>TM</sup>, and TomoTherapy<sup>TM</sup> delivery systems, which are now more commonly available.</p>
<p class="indent">Proton therapy is another approach to EBRT. Proton therapy utilizes high linear energy transfer (LET) in the form of charged protons generated by a large magnetic unit called a <em>cyclotron.</em> The advantage of proton therapy is that it is capable of delivering its high-energy dose to a deep-seated tumor, with decreased doses of radiation to the tissues in front of the tumor while virtually no energy exits through the patient&#x2019;s healthy tissue behind the tumor (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>). Proton therapy permits treatment of deep tumors near critical structures, such as the heart or major blood vessels.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Internal Radiation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Internal radiation includes localized implantation or systemic radionuclide administration. Brachytherapy delivers the dose of radiation to a localized area while systemic radiotherapy relies on strategies for getting the radionuclides closer to the tumor. The specific radioisotope used is selected based on its half-life, which is the time it takes for half of its radioactivity to decay, and the depth of penetration of the radiation.</p>
<p class="h7">Brachytherapy</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Brachytherapy</strong> is the placement of radioactive sources within or immediately next to the cancer site in order to provide a highly targeted, intense dose of radiation beyond a dose that is usually provided by EBRT. In addition, this form of radiation delivery helps to spare exposure to normal surrounding tissue. The radiation source can be implanted by means of needles or rods, seeds, beads, ribbons, or catheters placed into body cavities (vagina, abdomen, pleura), lumens within organs, or interstitial tissue compartments (breast, prostate). Multiple imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI are used to guide placement of radiation sources. Patients may have many fears or concerns about internal radiation, and the nurse explains the various approaches and safety precautions that will be used to protect the patient, family, and health care staff.</p>
<p class="indent">Brachytherapy may be delivered as a temporary or a permanent implant. Temporary applications are delivered as high-dose radiation (HDR) for short periods of time, while low<strong>-</strong>dose radiation (LDR) is delivered over a more extended period. The primary advantage of HDR brachytherapy is that treatment time is shorter, there is reduced exposure to personnel, and the procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis over several days. HDR brachytherapy can be used for intraluminal, surface, interstitial, and intracavitary lesions. Intraluminal HDR brachytherapy involves the insertion of catheters or hollow tubes into the lumens of organs so that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page318" title="318"></span>the radioisotope can be delivered as close to the tumor bed as possible. Lesions in the bronchus, esophagus, rectum, or bile duct can be treated with this approach. Contact or surface application is used for treatment of tumors of the eye, such as retinoblastoma in children or ocular melanoma in adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Interstitial HDR implants, used in treating such malignancies as prostate, pancreatic, or breast cancer, may be temporary or permanent, depending on the site and radioisotope used. Based on the dose to be delivered (LDR or HDR), the implants may consist of seeds, needles, wires, strands, or small catheters positioned to provide a local radiation source. Prostate HDR therapy is one form of interstitial brachytherapy, in which radioactive strands or wires are placed, while the patient is under anesthesia, into hollow catheters that have been inserted in the perineum close to the prostate gland (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Intracavitary radioisotopes are used to treat gynecologic cancers. In these malignancies, the radioisotopes are inserted into specially positioned applicators within the vagina. The applicator placement is verified by x-ray. Treatment can be achieved with either HDR or LDR brachytherapy sources, depending on the extent of disease. LDR therapy requires hospitalization because the patient is treated over several days. HDR intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been used as a treatment approach for advanced gynecologic cancer that has spread to the paraaortic area or pelvic wall (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib992">Krengli, Pisani, Deantonio, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Systemic radiotherapy (radiopharmaceutical therapy) involves oral or intravenous (IV) administration of a therapeutic radioactive isotope targeted to a specific tumor. Radioactive iodine (I-131) is a widely used form of systemic brachytherapy that is the primary treatment for thyroid cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Divgi, 2018</a>). Radium-223 dichloride selectively targets prostate cancer bone metastases with high-energy, short-range alpha particles and is approved for the treatment of patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease (NCCN, 2019f). Radioisotopes are also used as a form of radioimmunotherapy for the treatment of refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see <a href="c30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a> for more information on lymphoma).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s393">Toxicity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;toxicity:&lt;/b&gt; an unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or condition associated with cancer treatment">toxicity</button></strong> is an unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or condition associated with cancer treatment. Toxicities associated with radiation therapy are most often localized in the region being irradiated and may be increased if concomitant chemotherapy is given (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Acute or early toxicities most often begin within 2 weeks of the initiation of treatment and occur when normal cells within the treatment area are damaged and cellular death exceeds regeneration. Body tissues most affected are those that normally proliferate rapidly, such as the skin, the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, and the bone marrow.</p>
<p class="indent">Altered skin integrity is common and can include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;alopecia:&lt;/b&gt; hair loss">alopecia</button></strong> (hair loss) associated with whole brain radiation. Other skin reactions, referred to as radiodermatitis, occur along a continuum ranging from erythema and dry desquamation (flaking of skin) to moist or wet desquamation (dermis exposed, skin oozing serous fluid) to, potentially, ulceration. Factors that contribute to the severity of radiodermatitis include the dose and form of radiation; use of concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy; inclusion of skin folds in the irradiated area; increased age, poor nutritional status, chronic sun exposure, current smoking status, and the presence of medical comorbidities, such as diabetes or kidney failure (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Symptoms of radiodermatitis may necessitate treatment interruption, delays, or cessation of therapy. Re-epithelialization occurs after treatments have been completed. Hyperpigmentation, a less severe radiation-associated skin reaction, may develop about 2 to 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Alterations in oral mucosa secondary to radiation therapy in the head and neck region include stomatitis (inflammation of the oral tissues), decreased salivation and xerostomia (dryness of the mouth), and change in or loss of taste. Depending on the targeted region, any portion of the gastrointestinal mucosa may be involved, causing <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mucositis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the lining of the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract often associated with cancer therapies">mucositis</button></strong> (inflammation of the lining of the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract). For example, patients receiving thoracic irradiation for lung cancer may experience acute esophageal irritation&#x2014;associated chest pain and dysphagia. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur if the stomach or colon is in the radiation field. Symptoms subside and gastrointestinal re-epithelialization occurs after treatments have been completed. Bone marrow cells proliferate rapidly, and if sites containing bone marrow (e.g., the iliac crest or sternum) are included in the radiation field, anemia, leukopenia (decreased white blood cells [WBCs]), and thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelets) may result. The patient is then at increased risk for infection and bleeding until blood cell counts return to normal.</p>
<p class="indent">Systemic side effects are commonly experienced by patients receiving radiation therapy. These include fatigue, malaise, and anorexia that may be secondary to biochemical mediators released when tumor cells are destroyed. Fatigue is commonly reported as one of the most distressing cancer-related symptoms. According to Kessels, Husson, and Van Der Feltz-Cornelis (2018), up to 99% of patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy will experience fatigue. Additionally, patients often report increased severity of fatigue when radiation therapy is used along with other cancer treatments. These early effects tend to be temporary and most often subside within 6 months of the cessation of treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Late effects (approximately 6 months to years after treatment) of radiation therapy may occur in body tissues that were in the field of radiation. These effects are chronic, usually a result of permanent damage to tissues, loss of elasticity, and changes secondary to a decreased vascular supply. Severe late effects include fibrosis, atrophy, ulceration, and necrosis and may affect the lungs, heart, central nervous system, and bladder. With advances in treatment planning and the accuracy of treatment delivery, the occurrence of late toxicities has diminished. However, late or chronic symptoms, such as dysphagia, incontinence, cognitive impairment, and sexual dysfunction, may persist for several years with implications for survivors&#x2019; overall health and quality of life (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kessels et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s394">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses anticipate, prevent, and work collaboratively with other providers to manage symptoms associated with radiation therapy in order to promote healing, patient comfort, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page319" title="319"></span>and quality of life. Symptoms that are not appropriately managed may lead to poor outcomes as a result of interruptions, decreased doses, or early cessation of treatment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib996">Lazarev, Gupta, Ghiassi-Nejad, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1050">Wagner, Zhao, Goss, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, nurses consider factors that may be predictive of radiation toxicities or radiosensitivity of tissues. In particular, advanced age, elevated radiation dose, and BMI have been associated with greater toxicity and symptoms (O&#x2019;Gorman, Sasiadek, Denieffe, et al., 2015). The nature of the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and radiation toxicities is less clear. For example, a decreased BMI was found to be associated with an increased incidence of toxicities in women with cervical cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1037">Rubinsak, Kang, Fields, et al., 2018</a>); whereas, an increased BMI (obesity) was associated with increased incidence of late toxicities in men being treated for prostate cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib938">Akthar, Liao, Eggener, et al., 2019</a>). Consequently, the area of the body being irradiated must be used as the focus of nursing assessments of radiation toxicities.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients receiving EBRT, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s skin, nutritional status, and general feelings of well-being throughout the course of treatment. Evidence-based protocols for nursing management of the toxicities associated with radiation therapy are used. If systemic symptoms such as fatigue occur the nurse explains that these symptoms are a result of the treatment and do not represent deterioration or progression of the disease. The nurse should recommend evidence-based interventions for the management of fatigue, which should include aerobic exercise, which is most effective when adherence is high (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kessels et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s395">Protecting Caregivers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient has a radioactive implant in place, the nurse and other health care providers need to protect themselves, as well as the patient, from the effects of radiation. Patients receiving internal radiation emit radiation while the implant is in place; therefore, contact with the health care team is guided by principles of time, distance, and shielding to minimize exposure of personnel to radiation. Specific instructions are provided by the radiation safety officer from the radiology department and specify the maximum time that can be spent safely in the patient&#x2019;s room, the shielding equipment to be used, and special precautions and actions to be taken if the implant is dislodged (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>). Safety precautions used in caring for a patient receiving brachytherapy include assigning the patient to a private room, posting appropriate notices about radiation safety precautions, having staff members wear dosimeter badges, making sure that pregnant staff members are not assigned to the patient&#x2019;s care, prohibiting visits by children or pregnant visitors, limiting visits from others to 30 minutes daily, and seeing that visitors maintain a 6-foot distance from the radiation source.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with seed implants typically return home; radiation exposure to others is minimal. Information about any precautions, if needed, is provided to the patient and family members to ensure safety. Depending on the dose and energy emitted by a systemic radionuclide, patients may or may not require special precautions or hospitalization (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Halperin et al., 2019</a>). The nurse should explain the rationale for these precautions to keep the patient from feeling unduly isolated.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s396">Chemotherapy</h3>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chemotherapy:&lt;/b&gt; the use of medications to kill tumor cells by interfering with cellular functions and reproduction">Chemotherapy</button></strong> involves the use of antineoplastic drugs in an attempt to destroy cancer cells by interfering with cellular functions, including replication and DNA repair (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). Chemotherapy is used primarily to treat systemic disease rather than localized lesions that are amenable to surgery or radiation. Chemotherapy may be combined with surgery, radiation therapy, or both to reduce tumor size preoperatively (neoadjuvant), to destroy any remaining tumor cells postoperatively (adjuvant), or to treat some forms of leukemia or lymphoma (primary). The goals of chemotherapy (cure, control, or palliation) must be realistic because they will determine the medications that are used and the aggressiveness of the treatment plan.</p>
