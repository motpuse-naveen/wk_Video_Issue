<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;amputation:&lt;/b&gt; removal of a body part, usually a limb or part of a limb">Amputation</button></strong> is the removal of a body part by a surgical procedure or trauma. The majority of amputations are often consequences of vascular disease, especially from diabetes (see Chapters 26 and 46); trauma is the second most common indication. African Americans are at heightened risk of having amputations. Approximately 2 million individuals in the United States are living with some type of limb loss; by 2050, there will be an estimated 3.6 million (AAOS, 2019e).</p>

<p class="indent">An amputation is performed to control pain or disease process, to improve function, and to save or improve the patient&#x2019;s quality of life. If the health care team communicates a positive attitude, the patient adjusts to the amputation more readily and actively participates in the rehabilitative plan, learning how to modify activities and how to use assistive devices for ADLs and mobility.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1568">Level of Amputation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The level of amputation is performed at the most distal point that will heal successfully and should take into account the ability of the patient to achieve a successful rehabilitation. The site and extent of amputation is determined by circulation in the area (and whether or not necrosis is present), the degree of tissue loss and viability of the tissues, functional usefulness (i.e., meets the requirements for the use of a prosthesis) and the presence of infection (<a href="#bib2816">Guest, Marshall, &#x0026; Stansby, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The circulatory status of the limb is evaluated through physical examination and diagnostic studies. Muscle and skin perfusion are important for healing. Doppler flow studies with duplex ultrasound, segmental pressure determinations, and transcutaneous oxygen measurements of the limb are valuable diagnostic aids. Angiography is performed if revascularization is considered an option.</p>
<p class="indent">The objective of surgery is to conserve as much limb length as needed to preserve function and possibly to achieve a good prosthetic fit. Preservation of knee and elbow joints is desirable. <a href="#ff37-23">Figure 37-23</a> shows the levels at which a limb may be amputated. Most amputations involving limbs eventually can be fitted with a prosthesis.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff37-23">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff37-23.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff37-23.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;37-23 &#x2022;</span> Level of amputation is determined by circulatory adequacy, type of prosthesis, function of the part, and muscle balance. <strong>A.</strong> Level of amputation of upper limb. <strong>B.</strong> Level of amputation of lower limb.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The amputation of toes and portions of the foot can cause changes in gait and balance. A Syme amputation (modified ankle disarticulation amputation) is performed most frequently for extensive foot trauma and aims to produce a durable residual limb that can withstand full weight bearing. Below-knee amputation (BKA) is preferred to above-knee amputation (AKA) because of the importance of the knee joint and the energy requirements for walking. A knee <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;disarticulation:&lt;/b&gt; amputation through a joint">disarticulation</button></strong> (e.g., amputation through the joint) is most successful with a young, active patient who can develop precise control of the prosthesis. When AKAs are performed, all possible length is preserved, muscles are stabilized and shaped, and hip contractures are prevented to maximize ambulatory potential (<a href="#bib2816">Guest et al., 2019</a>). Most people who have a hip disarticulation amputation must rely on a wheelchair for mobility.</p>
<p class="indent">Upper limb amputations are performed with the goal of preserving maximal functional length. The prosthesis is fitted early to ensure maximum function.</p>
<p class="indent">A &#x201C;staged&#x201D; amputation may be used when gangrene and infection exist. Initially, a d&#x00E9;briding amputation in the form of a guillotine amputation (i.e., transfemoral, transtibial) is performed to remove the infected and necrotic tissue. Once the infected limb is removed, systemic antibiotics are administered, and the wound is left open and allowed to drain. In a few days, after the infection has been controlled and the patient&#x2019;s condition has stabilized, a definitive amputation with skin closure is performed; a drain may be left in place (<a href="#bib2816">Kalapatapu, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1569">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications that may occur with amputation include hemorrhage, infection, skin breakdown, phantom limb pain, and joint contracture. Because major blood vessels have been severed, hemorrhage may occur. Infection is a risk with all surgical procedures. The risk of infection increases with contaminated wounds after traumatic amputation. Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgery is recommended. Skin irritation caused by the prosthesis may result in skin breakdown. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;phantom limb pain:&lt;/b&gt; pain perceived in an amputated section">Phantom limb pain</button></strong> (pain perceived in the amputated section) is caused by the severing of peripheral nerves. Joint contracture is caused by positioning and a protective flexion withdrawal pattern associated with pain and muscle imbalance (<a href="#bib2816">Kalapatapu, 2019</a>). Associated comorbidities such as ischemic disease and psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety must also be monitored closely as they can contribute to further complications and chronic limb pain (<a href="#bib2816">Chung &#x0026; Yoneda, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1570">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objective of treatment is to achieve healing of the amputation wound, the result being a nontender residual limb with healthy skin for prosthetic use. Healing is enhanced by gentle handling of the residual limb, control of residual limb edema and pain, and the use of aseptic technique in wound care to avoid infection (<a href="#bib2816">Kalapatapu, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The primary postoperative dressings to support soft tissues, control pain and edema, and prevent joint contractures include nonremovable rigid dressings, removable rigid dressings, soft dressings (elastic and crepe), and weight-bearing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1196" title="1196"></span>immediate postoperative prostheses (<a href="#bib2779">Reichmann, Stevens, Rheinstein, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The type of dressing used in patients with lower limb amputations varies. A reduction in edema, pain, contractures, healing time, time to prosthetic fitting, and injury due to falls has been shown for certain types of amputations (e.g., transtibial) with the use of removable rigid dressings as compared to soft dressings (<a href="#bib2816">Reichmann et al., 2018</a>). However, a soft dressing with or without compression may be used if there is significant wound drainage, frequent inspection of the residual limb is required, and the patient has poor skin integrity (<a href="#bib2747">Kwah, Webb, Go, et al., 2019</a>). An immobilizing splint may be incorporated in the soft dressing. Good clinical judgment over which dressing to use should consider the risks and benefits for each individual patient. A wound drain can be placed to remove excess blood and drainage from the surgical site (<a href="#bib2816">Schreiber, 2017</a>). Staples or sutures maintain closure at the operative site and are typically removed approximately 3&#x00A0;weeks postoperatively.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1571">Rehabilitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The multidisciplinary rehabilitation team (patient, nurse, primary provider, social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, prosthetist, vocational rehabilitation worker) helps the patient achieve the highest possible level of function and participation in life activities (see <a href="#ff37-24">Fig. 37-24</a>). Prosthetic clinics, amputee support programs, and peer visits (face-to-face, telephone, digital) for patients with a limb amputation facilitate the rehabilitation process, both physically and psychosocially (<a href="#bib2816">Reichmann &#x0026; Bartman, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who undergo amputation need support as they grieve the loss and change in body image. Their reactions can include anger, bitterness, and hostility. Psychological issues (e.g., denial, anxiety, avoidance) may be influenced by the type of support the patient receives from the rehabilitation team, the effectiveness of pain management, and by how quickly ADLs and the use of the prosthesis are learned. Providing education about the full options and capabilities available with the various prosthetic devices, as well as the recovery of walking capacity, if appropriate, can give the patient a sense of control over the resulting disability and promote independence (<a href="#bib2756">Luza, Ferreira, Minsky, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff37-24">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff37-24.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff37-24.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;37-24 &#x2022;</span> Many patients with amputations receive prostheses soon after surgery and begin learning how to use them with the help and support of the rehabilitation team, which includes nurses, primary providers, physical therapists, and others.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Patients undergoing amputation because of severe trauma are usually young and healthy. These patients heal rapidly and are physically able to participate in a vigorous rehabilitation program. Because the amputation is the result of an injury, the patient needs holistic multidisciplinary support from the beginning in order to accept the sudden change in body image and to deal with the stresses of hospitalization, long-term rehabilitation, and modification of lifestyle (<a href="#bib2771">Noblet, Lineham, Wiper, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon27-medal.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Within the past two decades, numerous U.S. military personnel have sustained conflict-related amputations from exposure to blasts from improvised explosive devices. The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) follows its own set of periodically updated evidence-based guidelines to ensure that veterans with amputations consistently receive quality care (VA/DoD, 2017). In addition, so that the complex needs of these young, previously healthy men and women may be met, the U.S. Army instituted both a specialized treatment center for patients with amputations and a database registry to facilitate long-term treatment and management. Treatment for these injured service members addresses not only physical rehabilitation needs, but also ways to optimize psychosocial functioning (VA/DoD, 2017). A multidisciplinary rehabilitation team with referral to behavioral health services are considered key components to therapy.</p>

<p class="processppara">Before surgery, the nurse must evaluate the neurovascular and functional status of the limb through history and physical assessment. If the patient has experienced a traumatic amputation, the nurse assesses the function and condition of the residual limb. The nurse also assesses the circulatory status and function of the unaffected limb. If infection or gangrene develops, the patient may have associated enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and purulent drainage. A culture and sensitivity test is obtained to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and develops a postoperative plan for nutritional care in consultation with a dietitian or metabolic nutrition support team, if indicated. A diet with adequate protein and vitamins is essential to promote wound healing. Additional calories may be necessary due to the energy required for transfers and ADLs when using a prosthesis (<a href="#bib2816">Schreiber, 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1196</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1197" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1197">p. 1197</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Any concurrent health problems (e.g., dehydration, anemia, cardiac insufficiency, chronic respiratory problems, diabetes) need to be identified and treated so that the patient is in the best possible condition to withstand the surgical procedure. The use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasoconstrictors, or vasodilators may influence management and prolong or delay wound healing.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s psychological status. Evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s emotional reaction to amputation is important. Grief responses to permanent alterations in body image, function, and mobility are likely. Professional counseling and available support services can help the patient cope in the aftermath of amputation surgery.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals of the patient may include relief of pain, including phantom limb pain, wound healing, acceptance of altered body image, resolution of the grieving process, independence in self-care, restoration of physical mobility, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Pain may be incisional or may be caused by inflammation, infection, pressure on a bony prominence, hematoma, or phantom limb pain. Muscle spasms may add to the patient&#x2019;s discomfort. Surgical pain can be effectively controlled with opioid analgesics that may be accompanied with evacuation of a hematoma or accumulated fluid. Changing the patient&#x2019;s position or placing a light sandbag on the residual limb to counteract the muscle spasm may improve the patient&#x2019;s level of comfort. Evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s pain and responses to interventions is an important component of pain management.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Many patients who have amputations begin to experience phantom limb pain soon after surgery. It is a complex pain condition that has been reported in 60% to 80% of patients with amputations (<a href="#bib2816">Hall, Abd-Elsayed, &#x0026; Eldabe, 2019</a>). The patient reports pain in the missing limb as if it were still present. The pain is described as if the amputated limb feels crushed, cramped, or twisted in an abnormal position; this pain is sometimes accompanied by numbness, tingling, or sensations of burning or electric shock. Phantom limb pain occurs intermittently and unpredictably; episodes of pain may last seconds or hours. When a patient describes phantom pains or sensations, the nurse acknowledges these feelings as real and encourages the patient to verbalize when in pain so that effective treatment may be given. Phantom limb pain typically diminishes over time for most patients, with episodes gradually becoming less frequent and of lesser duration; however, some patients continue to experience phantom limb pain as long as 2 years after the amputation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The pathogenesis of the phantom limb pain phenomenon is believed to involve changes in both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms. Disruption in neuronal pathways are thought to cause neuroplastic changes that in turn result in changes in cortical representation, or the proprioceptive, tactile, and visual image of body parts as perceived by the cerebral cortex (<a href="#bib2816">Hall et al., 2019</a>). Preoperative epidural analgesia (preemptive analgesia) may reduce the incidence and severity of phantom limb pain over the long term (<a href="#bib2816">Guest et al., 2019</a>). Perioperatively, the patient may be managed with acetaminophen, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants (gabapentin), opioids, and NMDA receptor antagonists (ketamine infusion). Epidural and perineural catheter analgesia may be used during and immediately after the operation (<a href="#bib2816">Hall et al., 2019</a>). Opioid analgesics may be effective in relieving postoperative pain. In addition, beta-blockers may relieve dull, burning discomfort; anticonvulsants control stabbing and cramping pain; and tricyclic antidepressants may not only alleviate phantom limb pain but may also be prescribed to improve mood and coping ability. Therapies that may be used as adjuncts to pharmacologic treatments include mirror therapy (i.e., the patient views and moves the unaffected limb in a mirror that is in a box or blocking the view of the affected limb), massage, biofeedback, acupuncture, repositioning, TENS, guided imagery, virtual reality, and neuromodulation (<a href="#bib2816">Hall et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib2729">Herrador Colmenero, Perez Marmol, Marti-Garcia, et al., 2018</a>). The nurse monitors the effectiveness of these treatments and collaborates with the multidisciplinary team to advocate for optimal pain control. Successful pain management following amputation promotes positive patient outcomes and lowers the cost of care (VA/DoD, 2017).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> W<small>OUND</small> H<small>EALING</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Following amputation, the incision should be examined daily for signs of infection. The residual limb must be handled gently and should be measured once every 8 to 12 hours postoperatively to assess for edema formation. Neurovascular assessments (including the most distal pulse, movement, sensation, skin temperature) are also performed at these intervals, and compared to the unaffected limb to ensure that there is adequate blood supply. The dressing is changed as prescribed and whenever soiled, using aseptic technique to prevent infection and possible osteomyelitis (<a href="#bib2816">Kalapatapu, 2019</a>). Drains are maintained and can be discontinued when the volume in the drain reservoir is minimal.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the rigid or soft dressing inadvertently comes off, the nurse must immediately wrap the residual limb with an elastic compression bandage. If this is not done, excessive edema will develop in a short time, resulting in a delay in rehabilitation. The nurse notifies the surgeon if the dressing comes off so that another one can be applied promptly.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Patients&#x2019; Postamputation Viewing of Selves in the Mirror</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Freysteinson, W., Thomas, L., Sebastian-Deutsch, A., et al. (2017). A study of the amputee experience of viewing self in the mirror. <em>Rehabilitation Nursing</em>, <em>37</em>(1), 22&#x2013;32.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Approximately two million individuals are living with the loss of a limb in the United States, and this incidence is expected to nearly double by 2050. The amputation of a limb is a traumatic event and affects an individual physically and psychologically. A visible disfigurement such as an amputation can lead to distortions in body image, depression, and low self-esteem as well as nonacceptance of a prosthesis in the rehabilitation phase. For a patient with an amputation, one of the most shocking and anxiety producing situations that can negatively impact the perception of body image is the mirror-viewing experience (viewing one&#x2019;s self in a mirror after the amputation of a limb). However, the research evidence addressing this topic is limited. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of viewing of self in a mirror after an amputation and the perceptions of what nurses should know about clinical mirror interventions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A hermeneutic phenomenologic design was used. Snowball sampling was used to recruit 17 participants who consented to be in the study. In order to be included in the study, participants had to be at least 18 years of age, have an amputation of an upper or lower limb, and have an ability to speak, read, and understand English. Five focus groups of 3 to 6 participants, lasting approximately 60 to 90 minutes, were conducted in a research rehabilitative hospital setting. Key questions asked included: Describe an experience about one of the first times you saw yourself in a mirror after amputation; what were your feelings and emotions? What was your self-talk before/during/after looking in the mirror? How would you describe the journey of viewing self in the mirror the first time to what it is like to view self in the mirror now, and what might each of the stages of this journey be called? The question which provided the most information about participant perceptions of potential mirror interventions was: What would you say is really important for health care providers to know about mirrors?</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The interpretation of data revealed that the act of viewing self in a mirror at any time after an amputation had three key elements: decision, seeing self, and consent. The trajectory of mirror shock, mirror anguish, recognizing self, and accepting a new normal are key themes and adds to the existing literature. Reasons to decide to view self in the mirror included curiosity, appearance, care of incision or residual limb, and gait/posture assessment. The experience of viewing self in the mirror after an amputation changes over time, and each person&#x2019;s mirror trajectory begins when initially making the decision of viewing self in a mirror after the amputation. Participants recommend that the nurse facilitate the initial mirror viewing experience and use the mirror as a tool to assess for skin breakdown and to help correct gait and balance.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The viewing of self in the mirror after an amputation can be a very difficult and emotional experience. Nurses are in a unique position to show support and understanding of the situation by facilitating the initial mirror viewing of the patient&#x2019;s amputation in a proper and controlled setting. When nurses are present during the initial mirror viewing process, the patient realizes that they are not alone in this experience and that the nurse understands what they are going through. There appears to be a lack of mirrors in health care settings; therefore, it is recommended that rooms in private hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have more small and full-length mirrors.</p>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Application of consistent pressure to the residual limb reduces edema formation and helps to shape the residual limb so that it may fit a prosthetic. The wound should be assessed to ensure that it is healing and that there are no signs of infection (e.g., redness, purulent drainage), which can also hamper optimal prosthetic fit. After the incision is healed and the limb is shaped appropriately, the patient is instructed how to care for the residual limb (VA/DoD, 2017).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> B<small>ODY</small> I<small>MAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Amputation is a procedure that alters the patient&#x2019;s body image. The nurse who has established a trusting relationship with the patient is better able to communicate acceptance of the patient who has experienced an amputation. The nurse encourages the patient to look at, feel, and care for the residual limb. Nursing research findings suggest that the nurse be present with patients who view themselves in mirrors after an amputation (<a href="#bib2718">Freysteinson, Thomas, Sebastian-Deutsch, et al., 2017</a>) (see Nursing Research Profile: <a href="#ct37-9">Chart 37-9</a>). It is important to identify the patient&#x2019;s strengths and resources to facilitate rehabilitation. The nurse helps the patient regain the previous level of independent functioning. The patient who is accepted as a whole person is more readily able to resume responsibility for self-care; self-concept improves, and body image changes are accepted. Even with highly motivated patients, this process may take months.</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">The nurse can provide the following interventions to foster a positive self-image: encouraging the patient to care for the residual limb, allowing the expression of grief, and promoting utilization of available resources.</p></div>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>H<small>ELPING THE</small> P<small>ATIENT TO</small> R<small>ESOLVE</small> G<small>RIEVING</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The loss of a limb (or part of one) may come as a shock even if the patient was prepared preoperatively. The patient&#x2019;s behavior (e.g., crying, withdrawal, apathy, anger) and expressed feelings (e.g., depression, fear, helplessness) reveal how the patient is coping with the loss and working through the grieving process.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse creates an accepting and supportive atmosphere in which the patient and family are encouraged to express and share their feelings and work through the grief process. The support from family and friends promotes the patient&#x2019;s acceptance of the loss. The nurse helps the patient deal with immediate needs and become oriented to realistic rehabilitation goals and future independent functioning. Psychological needs can be further addressed by mental health professionals; referrals for support services and spiritual advisors (e.g., pastoral care) may be appropriate (<a href="#bib2816">Myers, VanDamme, &#x0026; Pasquina, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1199" title="1199"></span>P<small>ROMOTING</small> I<small>NDEPENDENT</small> S<small>ELF</small>-C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Amputation affects the patient&#x2019;s ability to provide adequate self-care. The patient is encouraged to be an active participant in self-care. The patient needs time to accomplish these tasks and must not be rushed. Practicing an activity with consistent, supportive supervision in a relaxed environment enables the patient to learn self-care skills. The patient and the nurse need to maintain positive attitudes and minimize fatigue and frustration during the learning process.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Independence in dressing, toileting, and bathing depends on balance, transfer abilities, and physiologic tolerance of the activities. The nurse works with the physical therapist and occupational therapist to educate and supervise the patient in these self-care activities.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with an upper limb amputation has self-care deficits in feeding, bathing, and dressing. Assistance is provided only as needed; the nurse encourages the patient to learn to do these tasks, using assistive feeding and dressing aids when needed. The nurse, therapists, and prosthetist work with the patient to achieve maximum independence.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<small>SSISTING THE</small> P<small>ATIENT TO</small> A<small>CHIEVE</small> P<small>HYSICAL</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Assisting the Patient with a Lower Limb Amputation.</span> Proper positioning of the residual limb prevents the development of hip or knee joint contracture in the patient with a lower limb amputation. The limb should be elevated for 24 hours after amputation to promote venous return and decrease edema (<a href="#bib2816">Schreiber, 2017</a>). After this period, elevation, abduction, external rotation, and flexion of the lower limb are to be avoided. The patient is encouraged not to sit for long periods of time to prevent flexion contracture or with the affected extremity dangling or in a dependent position to prevent edema (<a href="#bib2816">Schreiber, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The residual limb should not be placed on a pillow because a flexion contracture of the hip may result. The nurse encourages the patient to turn from side to side and to assume a prone position, 20 to 30 minutes several times per day to stretch the flexor muscles and to prevent flexion contracture of the hip. The legs should remain close together to prevent an abduction deformity. The nurse encourages the patient to use assistive devices to more readily perform self-care activities and to identify what home modifications, if any, should be made to perform these activities in the home environment.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Postoperative ROM exercises are started early because contracture deformities develop rapidly. ROM exercises include hip and knee exercises for patients with BKAs and hip exercises for patients with AKAs. It is essential that the patient understands the importance of exercising the residual limb as well as the unaffected extremities for joint mobility and strengthening (<a href="#bib2816">Schreiber, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The upper limbs, trunk, and abdominal muscles are exercised and strengthened. The extensor muscles in the arm and the depressor muscles in the shoulder play an important part in crutch walking. The patient uses an overbed trapeze to change position and strengthen the biceps. The patient may flex and extend the arms while holding weights. Doing push-ups while seated strengthens the triceps muscles. Exercises (such as hyperextension of the residual limb), conducted under the supervision of the physical therapist, also aid in strengthening muscles as well as increasing circulation, reducing edema, and preventing atrophy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Strength and endurance are assessed, and activities are increased gradually to prevent fatigue. As the patient progresses to independent use of the wheelchair, the use of ambulatory aids, or ambulation with a prosthesis, the nurse emphasizes safety considerations. Environmental barriers (e.g., steps, inclines, doors, throw rugs, wet surfaces) are identified, and methods of managing them are implemented. It is important to anticipate, identify, and manage problems associated with the use of the mobility aids. Proper education in using assistive devices will help prevent these problems.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Amputation of the leg changes the center of gravity; therefore, the patient may need to practice position changes (e.g., standing from sitting, standing on one foot). The patient is taught transfer techniques early and is reminded to maintain good posture when getting out of bed. A well-fitting shoe with a nonskid sole should be worn. During position changes, the patient should be guarded and stabilized with a transfer belt at the waist to prevent falling.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">As soon as possible, the patient with a lower limb amputation is assisted to stand between parallel bars to allow extension of the temporary prosthesis to the floor with minimal weight bearing. How soon after surgery the patient is allowed to bear full body weight on the prosthesis depends on the patient&#x2019;s physical status and wound healing. As endurance increases and balance is achieved, ambulation is started with the use of parallel bars or crutches. The patient learns to use a normal gait, with the residual limb moving back and forth while walking with the crutches. To prevent a permanent flexion deformity from occurring, the residual limb should not be held up in a flexed position (<a href="#bib2816">Kalapatapu, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Assisting the Patient with an Upper Limb Amputation.</span> Because a patient who has had an upper limb amputated uses both shoulders to operate the prosthesis, the muscles of both shoulders are exercised. A patient with an above-elbow amputation or shoulder disarticulation is likely to develop a postural abnormality caused by loss of the weight of the amputated limb. Postural exercises are helpful.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with an upper limb amputation is taught how to carry out ADLs with one arm. The patient is started on one-handed self-care activities as soon as possible. The use of a temporary prosthesis is encouraged. The patient who learns to use the prosthesis soon after the amputation is less dependent on one-handed self-care activities.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with an upper limb amputation may wear a cotton T-shirt to prevent contact between the skin and shoulder harness and to promote absorption of perspiration. The prosthetist advises about cleaning the washable portions of the harness. Periodically, the prosthesis is inspected for potential problems.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Preparing the Patient for a Prosthesis.</span> The residual limb must be conditioned and shaped into a conical form to permit accurate fit, maximum comfort, and function of the prosthetic device. Elastic bandages, an elastic residual limb shrinker, or an air splint is used to condition and shape the residual limb. The nurse educates the patient or a member of the family about the correct method of bandaging.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Bandaging supports the soft tissue and minimizes the formation of edema while the residual limb is in a dependent position. The bandage is applied in such a manner that the remaining muscles required to operate the prosthesis are as firm as possible. An improperly applied elastic bandage <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1200" title="1200"></span>contributes to circulatory problems and a poorly shaped residual limb.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Effective preprosthetic care is important to ensure proper fitting of the prosthesis. The major problems that can delay prosthetic fitting during this period are flexion deformities, nonshrinkage of the residual limb, and abduction deformities of the hip.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The primary provider usually prescribes activities to condition or &#x201C;toughen&#x201D; the residual limb in preparation for a prosthesis. The patient begins by pushing the residual limb into a soft pillow, then into a firmer pillow, and finally against a hard surface. The patient is taught to massage the residual limb to mobilize the surgical incision site, decrease tenderness, and improve vascularity. Massage is usually started once healing has occurred and is first performed by the physical therapist. Skin inspection and preventive care are taught; mirrors may be used to visualize the skin on the residual limb (<a href="#bib2816">Rossbach, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The prosthesis socket is custom-shaped to the residual limb by the prosthetist. Prostheses are designed for specific activity levels and patient abilities. Types of prostheses include those that are hydraulic, pneumatic, biofeedback controlled, myoelectrically controlled, and synchronized. Adjustments of the prosthetic socket are made by the prosthetist to accommodate the residual limb changes that occur during the first 6 months to 1 year after surgery.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Assisting the Patient Who Is Not a Candidate for a Prosthesis.</span> Some patients with amputations are not candidates for a prosthesis due to preexisting factors (e.g., nonambulatory before amputation, dementia, AKA). If the use of a prosthesis is not possible, the patient is educated in safe use of a wheelchair to achieve independence. A special wheelchair designed for a patient who has had an amputation is recommended. Because of the decreased weight in the front, a regular wheelchair may tip backward when the patient sits in it. In wheelchairs designed for patients who have had amputations, the rear axle is set back about 5 cm (2 inches) to compensate for the change in weight distribution.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After any surgery, efforts are made to reestablish homeostasis and to prevent complications related to surgery, anesthesia, and immobility. The nurse assesses body systems (e.g., respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skin) for problems associated with immobility (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia, DVT, PE, anorexia, constipation, urinary stasis, pressure injuries).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Massive hemorrhage due to a loosened suture is a potentially life-threatening problem. The nurse monitors the patient for any signs or symptoms of bleeding and monitors the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and suction drainage.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Immediate postoperative bleeding may develop slowly or may take the form of massive hemorrhage resulting from a loosened suture. A large tourniquet should be in plain sight at the patient&#x2019;s bedside so that if severe bleeding occurs, it can be applied to the residual limb to control the hemorrhage. The nurse immediately notifies the surgeon in the event of excessive bleeding.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Infection is a common complication of amputation. Patients who have undergone traumatic amputation have contaminated wounds. The nurse administers prophylactic antibiotics as prescribed. The nurse must monitor the incision, dressing, and drainage for indications of infection (e.g., change in color, odor, or consistency of drainage; increasing discomfort). The nurse also assesses for systemic indicators of infection (e.g., elevated temperature, leukocytosis with an increase of more than 10% bands on the differential) and promptly reports indications of infection to the surgeon.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Skin breakdown may result from immobilization or pressure from various sources. The prosthesis may cause pressure areas to develop. The nurse and the patient assess for breaks in the skin. Careful skin hygiene is essential to prevent skin irritation, infection, and breakdown. The healed residual limb is washed and dried (gently) at least twice daily. The skin is inspected for persistent erythema, pressure areas, dermatitis, and blisters. If they are present, the prosthesis should not be worn until the complication is evaluated and treated in order to prevent further skin breakdown. Usually, a residual limb sock is worn to absorb perspiration and to prevent direct contact between the skin and the prosthetic socket. The sock is changed daily and must fit smoothly to prevent irritation caused by wrinkles. The socket of the prosthesis is washed with a mild detergent, rinsed, and dried thoroughly with a clean cloth. It must be thoroughly dry before the prosthesis is applied (<a href="#bib2816">Rossbach, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt="icon" /> <span class="yellow">Educating the Patient About Self-Care.</span> Before the patient is discharged to home or to a rehabilitation facility, the patient and family are encouraged to become active participants in care. They participate in care of the skin, residual limb, and prosthesis as appropriate. The patient receives ongoing education and practice sessions to learn to transfer and to use mobility aids and other assistive devices safely. The nurse explains the signs and symptoms of complications that must be reported to the primary provider (see <a href="#ct37-10">Chart 37-10</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span>After the patient has achieved physiologic homeostasis and has demonstrated achievement of major health care goals, rehabilitation continues either in a rehabilitation facility or at home. An inpatient&#x00A0;rehabilitation&#x00A0;facility may be indicated; these facilities have been shown to improve quality of life, ambulation and patient confidence, mobility, and prosthesis use with less associated pain (VA/DoD, 2017). In any case, continued support and evaluation by the home health nurse is essential.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s home environment should be assessed prior to discharge. Modifications are made to ensure the patient&#x2019;s continuing care, safety, and mobility. An overnight or weekend experience at home may be tried to identify problems that were not identified on the assessment visit. Physical therapy and occupational therapy may continue in the home or on an outpatient basis. Transportation to continuing health care appointments must be arranged. The social service department of the hospital or the home health agency may be of great assistance in securing personal assistance and transportation services.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">During follow-up health visits, the nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychosocial adjustment. Periodic preventive health assessments are necessary. An older adult spouse may not be able to provide the assistance required if needed at home. Modifications in the plan of care are made on the basis of such findings. Often, the patient and family find involvement in a postamputation support group and peer support programs to be of value; here, they can share problems, solutions, and resources (<a href="#bib2816">Reichmann &#x0026; Bartman, 2018</a>). Talking with those who have successfully dealt with a similar problem may help the patient develop a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because patients and their family members and health care providers tend to focus on the most obvious needs and issues, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices, such as regular physical examinations and diagnostic screening tests. Accessible facilities for screening, health care, and exercise are identified. Patients are instructed about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers.</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.png" alt=""/> A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after she fell down a flight of stairs and fractured her right hip. She is now 48 hours postoperative after a right ORIF to that hip. She is moderately overweight and has a history of smoking. She has been reluctant to get out of bed to ambulate and complains that her intermittent compression devices are uncomfortable, and she does not want to wear them. What is the strength of the evidence that supports the use of compression devices postoperatively for patients who have had ORIF post-hip fractures? What are her risks if she does not wear these devices postoperatively? How will you respond to the patient&#x2019;s request to not wear these devices?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.png" alt=""/> You are caring for a 30-year-old female who was involved in a motor vehicle crash and had a traumatic amputation of her left upper extremity at the scene. She is 7 days postoperative and is now complaining of phantom limb sensation and severe pain in the missing limb. She describes the quality of the pain as crushing, burning, and &#x201C;electric shock like&#x201D; and it spreads from her missing fingers to the length of her arm. She is becoming anxious with the severity of the pain and does not understand what is happening to her. Describe the assessments and interventions as you prioritize care for this patient. Identify the multidisciplinary collaboration necessary to provide a comprehensive treatment plan for this patient to promote the best outcomes.</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.png" alt=""/> You have been assigned to care for a 36-year-old male admitted to the inpatient orthopedic unit following a motorcycle crash. He had an external fixation device applied 8 hours ago for a fracture of the left tibia. During shift report, the nurse reports that the patient has been complaining of throbbing pain and paresthesia in his left lower leg that has not been alleviated despite administration of prescription opioid pain medication. Upon your initial assessment, you note that the patient&#x2019;s left calf is very swollen, shiny, and taut. Describe the additional physical assessments that should be conducted for this patient. What is your priority nursing diagnosis and plan of care?</p>
