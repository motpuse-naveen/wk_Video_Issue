<h4 class="h4" id="s3097">Huntington Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Huntington disease is a chronic, progressive, hereditary disease of the nervous system that results in progressive involuntary choreiform movement and dementia. The disease affects approximately 1 in 10,000 men or women of all races at midlife. Every person has the gene that causes Huntington disease; however, only those who inherit the expansion of the gene will develop the disease and pass it onto their children. Because it is transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene, each child of a parent with Huntington disease has a 50% risk of inheriting the disorder (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Smedley &#x0026; Coulson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A genetic mutation in Huntington disease, the presence of a repeat in the Huntington gene (<em>HTT</em>), has been identified (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Smedley &#x0026; Coulson, 2019</a>). Genetic testing can identify people who will develop this disease but cannot predict timing of disease onset. Although the gene was mapped in 1983, patients may choose not to be tested because of concerns about employment and health care discrimination. People of childbearing age with a family history of Huntington disease often seek information about their risk of disease transmission. Genetic counseling is crucial, and patients and their families may require long-term psychological counseling and emotional, financial, and legal support (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3098">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The basic pathology involves premature death of cells in the striatum (caudate and putamen) of the basal ganglia, the region deep within the brain that is involved in the control of movement. Cells also are lost in the cortex, the region of the brain associated with thinking, memory, perception, judgment, and behavior, and in the cerebellum, the area that coordinates voluntary muscle activity. Why the protein destroys only certain brain cells is unknown, but several theories have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. One possible theory is that glutamine, a building block for protein, abnormally collects in the cell nucleus, causing cell death (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McColgan &#x0026; Tabrizi, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3099">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">This condition is characterized by a triad of symptoms that includes motor dysfunction (the most prominent is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chorea:&lt;/b&gt; rapid, jerky, involuntary, purposeless movements of the extremities or facial muscles, including facial grimacing">chorea</button></strong>, or rapid, jerky, involuntary, purposeless movements); cognitive impairment (problems with attention and emotion recognition); and behavioral features, such as apathy and blunted affect (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McColgan &#x0026; Tabrizi, 2017</a>). As the disease progresses, constant writhing, twisting, and uncontrollable movements may involve the entire body. These motions are devoid of purpose or rhythm, although patients may try to turn them into purposeful movement. All of the body musculature is involved. Facial movements produce tics and grimaces. Speech becomes slurred, hesitant, often explosive, and eventually unintelligible. Chewing and swallowing are difficult, and there is a constant danger of choking and aspiration. Choreiform movements persist during sleep but are diminished (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Mestre &#x0026; Shannon, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As with speech, the gait becomes disorganized to the point that ambulation eventually is impossible. Although independent ambulation should be encouraged for as long as possible, a wheelchair usually becomes necessary. Eventually, the patient is confined to bed when the chorea interferes with walking, sitting, and all other activities. Bladder and bowel control are lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Cognitive impairment, such as problems with attention or recognizing emotions, occurs early on; in later stages, marked dementia is present. Initially, the patient is aware that the disease is responsible for the myriad dysfunctions that are occurring.</p>
<p class="indent">The behavioral changes may be more devastating to the patient and family than the abnormal movements. Personality changes may result in nervous, irritable, or impatient behaviors. In the early stages, patients are particularly subject to uncontrollable fits of anger, profound and often suicidal depression, apathy, anxiety, psychosis, or euphoria. Judgment and memory are impaired, and dementia eventually ensues (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Mestre &#x0026; Shannon, 2017</a>). Hallucinations, delusions, and paranoid thinking may precede the appearance of disjointed movements. Emotional and cognitive symptoms often become less acute as the disease progresses (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Mestre &#x0026; Shannon, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Onset usually occurs between 35 and 45 years of age, although about 10% of patients are children. The disease progresses slowly. Despite a ravenous appetite, patients usually become emaciated and exhausted. Patients succumb in 10 to 20 years to heart failure, pneumonia, or infection, or as a result of a fall or choking (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Mestre &#x0026; Shannon, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3100">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation of characteristic symptoms, a positive family history, and the known presence of the genetic marker cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeating on the Huntington gene (HTT)(<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Smedley &#x0026; Coulson, 2019</a>). CT or MRI scans show symmetrical striatal atrophy before motor symptoms appear (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Urrutia, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3101">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">No treatment halts or reverses the underlying process; therefore, the focus is on optimizing quality of life with available medication and supportive treatment. Patients experience the most benefit when they have integrated expertise of a Huntington disease multidisciplinary team (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Urrutia, 2019</a>). The only medication that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat the symptom of chorea is tetrabenazine (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Benzodiazepines and neuroleptic drugs have also been reported to control chorea. Motor signs must be assessed and evaluated on an ongoing basis so that optimal therapeutic drug levels can be reached. Akathisia (motor restlessness) in the patient who is overmedicated is dangerous because it may be mistaken for the restless fidgeting of the illness and consequently may be overlooked. In certain types of the disease, hypokinetic motor impairment resembles PD. In patients who present with rigidity, some temporary benefit may be obtained from antiparkinson medications, such as levodopa.</p>

<p class="indent">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants have been recommended for control of psychiatric symptoms. The threat of suicide is present particularly early in the course of the disease. Psychotic symptoms usually respond to antipsychotic medications. Psychotherapy aimed at allaying anxiety and reducing stress may be beneficial. Nurses must look beyond the disease to focus on the patient&#x2019;s needs and capabilities (see <a href="#ct65-4">Chart&#x00A0;65-4</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="ex2" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The needs of the patient and family for education depend on the nature and severity of the physical, cognitive, and psychological changes experienced by the patient. The patient and family members are educated about the medications prescribed and about signs indicating a need for change in medication or dosage. The educational plan addresses strategies to manage symptoms such as chorea, swallowing problems, limitations in ambulation, memory loss, irritability, depression, and loss of bowel and bladder function. Consultation with a speech therapist may be indicated to assist in identifying alternative communication strategies if speech is affected. A PEG tube may be considered for nutritional support later in the disease (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A program combining medical, nursing, psychological, social, occupational, speech, and physical rehabilitation services and palliative care is needed to help the patient and family cope with this severely disabling illness. Huntington disease exacts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2131" title="2131"></span>enormous emotional, physical, social, and financial tolls on every member of the family. The family needs supportive care as they adjust to the impact of the illness. Regular follow-up visits help allay the fear of abandonment.</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Pad the sides and head of the bed; ensure that the patient can see over the sides of bed.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Use padded heel and elbow protectors.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Keep the skin meticulously clean.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Apply emollient cleansing agent and skin lotion as needed.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Use soft sheets and bedding.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Have patient wear football padding or other forms of padding.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Encourage ambulation with assistance to maintain muscle tone.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Last">Secure the patient (only if necessary) in bed or chair with padded protective devices, making sure that they are loosened frequently.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAt"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing diagnosis:&lt;/b&gt; a clinical judgment concerning a person&#x2019;s, family&#x2019;s, or community&#x2019;s actual or potential health problems, state of health promotion, or potential risk that can be managed by independent nursing interventions">Nursing Diagnosis:</button></strong> Impaired nutritional intake due to inadequate ingestion and dehydration resulting from swallowing or chewing disorders and danger of choking or aspirating food</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Administer phenothiazines (chlorpromazine) as prescribed before meals (calms some patients).</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Talk to the patient before mealtime to promote relaxation; use mealtime for social interaction. Provide undivided attention and help the patient enjoy the mealtime experience.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Use a warming tray to keep food warm.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Learn the position that is best for <em>this</em> patient. Keep patient as close to upright as possible while feeding. Stabilize patient&#x2019;s head gently with one hand while feeding.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Show the food, explain what the foods are, and temperature (e.g., whether hot or cold).</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Encircle the patient with one arm and get as close as possible to provide stability and support while feeding. Use pillows and wedges for additional support.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Do not interpret stiffness, turning away, or sudden turning of the head as rejection; these are uncontrollable choreiform movements.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">For feeding, use a long-handled spoon (iced tea spoon). Place spoon on middle of tongue and exert slight pressure.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Place bite-sized food between patient&#x2019;s teeth. Serve stews, casseroles, and thick liquids.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Disregard messiness, and treat the person with dignity.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Wait for the patient to chew and swallow before introducing another spoonful. Make sure that bite-sized food is small.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Give between-meal feedings. Constant movement expends more calories. Patients often have voracious appetites, particularly for sweets.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Use blenderized meals if patient cannot chew; do not repeatedly give the same strained baby foods. Gradually introduce increased textures and consistencies to the diet.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">For swallowing difficulties:</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Apply gentle deep pressure around the patient&#x2019;s mouth.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Rub fingers in circles on the patient&#x2019;s cheeks and then down each side of the patient&#x2019;s throat.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Develop skill in the abdominal thrust (to be used in the event of choking).</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAt"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing diagnosis:&lt;/b&gt; a clinical judgment concerning a person&#x2019;s, family&#x2019;s, or community&#x2019;s actual or potential health problems, state of health promotion, or potential risk that can be managed by independent nursing interventions">Nursing Diagnosis:</button></strong> Impaired verbal communication from excessive grimacing and unintelligible speech</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Read to the patient.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Employ biofeedback and relaxation therapy to reduce stress.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Consult with speech therapist to help maintain and prolong communication abilities.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Try to devise a communication system, perhaps using cards with words or pictures of familiar objects, before verbal communication becomes too difficult. Patients can indicate correct card by hitting it with hand, grunting, or blinking the eyes.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Learn how this particular patient expresses needs and wants&#x2014;particularly nonverbal messages (widening of eyes, responses).</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Patients can understand even if unable to speak. Do not isolate patients by ceasing to communicate with them.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAt"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing diagnosis:&lt;/b&gt; a clinical judgment concerning a person&#x2019;s, family&#x2019;s, or community&#x2019;s actual or potential health problems, state of health promotion, or potential risk that can be managed by independent nursing interventions">Nursing Diagnosis:</button></strong> Acute confusion and impaired socialisation</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Reorient the patient after awakening.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Have clock, calendar, and wall posters in view to assist in orientation.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Use every opportunity for one-to-one contact.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Use music for relaxation.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Have the patient wear a medical identification bracelet.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Keep the patient in the social mainstream.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Recruit and train volunteers for social interaction. Role-model appropriate and creative interactions.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Do not abandon a patient because the disease is terminal. Patients are <em>living</em> until the end.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Home care assistance, day care centers, respite care, and eventually skilled long-term care can assist the patient and family in coping with the constant strain of the illness. Although the relentless progression of the disease cannot be halted, families can benefit from supportive care. Planning for end-of-life care should occur early in the disease (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Voluntary organizations can be major aids to families and have been largely responsible for bringing the illness to national attention. The Huntington Disease Society of America helps patients and families by providing information, referrals, family and public education, and support for research (see the Resources section).</p>
