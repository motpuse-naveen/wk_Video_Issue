<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pancreatitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the pancreas; may be acute or chronic">Pancreatitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the pancreas) is a serious disorder. The most basic classification system used to describe or categorize the various stages and forms of pancreatitis divides the disorder into acute and chronic forms. Acute pancreatitis can be a medical emergency associated with a high risk of life-threatening complications and mortality, whereas chronic pancreatitis often goes undetected because classic clinical and diagnostic findings are not always present in the early stages of the disease (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Srinivasan &#x0026; Friedman, 2018</a>). By the time symptoms occur in chronic pancreatitis, approximately 90% of normal acinar cell function (exocrine function) has been lost (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goldman &#x0026; Shaffer, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Srinivasan &#x0026; Friedman, 2018</a>). Acute pancreatitis does not usually lead to chronic pancreatitis unless complications develop. However, chronic pancreatitis can be characterized by acute episodes.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the mechanisms causing pancreatic inflammation are unknown, pancreatitis is commonly described as autodigestion of the pancreas. It is believed that the pancreatic duct becomes temporarily obstructed, accompanied by hypersecretion of the exocrine enzymes of the pancreas. These enzymes enter the bile duct, where they are activated and, together with bile, back up (reflux) into the pancreatic duct, causing pancreatitis.</p>
