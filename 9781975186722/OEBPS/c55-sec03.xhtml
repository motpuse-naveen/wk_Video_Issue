<h4 class="h4" id="s2578">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in patients with altered integumentary function. The nurse educates the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse also notes trends in results because they provide information about whether lesions are primary or secondary, disease progression, and the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2579">Skin Biopsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Performed to obtain tissue for microscopic examination, a skin biopsy may be obtained by shave, excision, or by a skin punch instrument that removes a small core of tissue. Biopsies are performed on skin nodules, plaques, blisters, and other lesions to rule out malignancy, to aid in diagnosis, and to perform additional testing such as Gram stain for bacteria or periodic acid&#x2013;Schiff (PAS) for fungal elements.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2580">Patch Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Performed to identify substances to which the patient has developed an allergy, patch testing involves applying the suspected allergens, such as nickel or fragrances, to normal skin under occlusive patches. Patients wear these occluded strips on their backs for 48 hours, and the area is assessed after 72 hours. The development of redness, fine elevations, or itching is considered a weak positive reaction; fine blisters, papules, and severe itching indicate a moderately positive reaction; and blisters, pain, and ulceration indicate a strong positive reaction. The nurse educates the patient on means to avoid the reactive allergens, which is often quite difficult, due to the prevalence of many of these substances in the patient&#x2019;s environment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2581">Skin Scrapings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tissue samples are scraped from suspected fungal lesions with a scalpel blade that has been moistened with oil so that the scraped skin adheres to the blade. The scraped material is transferred to a glass slide, covered with a coverslip, and examined microscopically. The spores and hyphae of dermatophyte infections, as well as infestations such as scabies, can be visualized.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2582">Tzanck Smear</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Tzanck smear is a test used to examine cells from blistering skin conditions, such as herpes zoster, varicella, herpes simplex, and all forms of pemphigus. The secretions from a suspected lesion are applied to a glass slide, stained, and examined.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2583">Wood Light Examination</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Wood light:&lt;/b&gt; ultraviolet light used for diagnosing skin conditions">Wood light</button></strong> is a special lamp that produces long-wave ultraviolet rays, which result in a characteristic blue to dark purple fluorescence. The color of the fluorescent light is best seen in a darkened room, where it is possible to differentiate epidermal from dermal lesions and hypo- and hyperpigmented lesions from normal skin. The patient is reassured that the light is not harmful to skin or eyes. Lesions that still contain melanin almost disappear under ultraviolet light, whereas lesions that are devoid of melanin increase in whiteness with ultraviolet light.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2584">Clinical Photographs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Photographs are taken to document the nature and extent of the skin condition and are used to determine progress or improvement resulting from treatment. They are sometimes used to track the status of moles to document if the characteristics of the mole are changing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2585">Nursing Implications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse may be responsible to ensure that consent forms are completed for surgical procedures and for clinical photography, that all specimens collected are managed according to protocol, that a log is maintained tracking specimens to and from the laboratory, and that results are received in a timely manner. The nurse educates the patient regarding appropriate care of surgical sites and implication of test results.</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> As a recent graduate nurse, you are aware that the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) has given a grade B recommendation for providing sun protection education for individuals who are fair skinned, parents of young children, adolescents, and young adults. You share this recommendation with a patient, and the patient asks you to explain what a grade B recommendation means. How would you respond? Discuss sun protection behaviors you will include when providing this education. What other factors found when performing a skin examination or in the patient&#x2019;s history may make sun protection counseling advisable outside of this recommendation?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> A 28-year-old woman who has rheumatoid arthritis was recently diagnosed with vitiligo and is expressing concerns about living with this condition. She has questions about how to protect her skin and how to cope with feelings of embarrassment. She also wants to know if her children are at risk for developing this condition. In providing patient education, which question will you address first? What education and resources will you provide and how will you counsel the patient to prioritize her physical, psychological, and emotional health?</p>
