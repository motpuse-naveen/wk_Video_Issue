<h4 class="h4" id="s1712">Peritonitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the serous membrane lining the abdominal cavity and covering the viscera. Usually, it is a result of bacterial infection but may occur secondary to a fungal or mycobacterial infection; the organisms come from diseases or disorders of the GI tract or, in women, from the internal reproductive organs (e.g., fallopian tube). The most common bacteria implicated are <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas,</em> and <em>Streptococcus</em> species. Peritonitis can also result from external sources such as abdominal surgery or trauma (e.g., gunshot wound, stab wound) or an inflammation that extends from an organ outside the peritoneal area, such as the kidney, or from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>). Peritonitis can be categorized as (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Primary peritonitis, also called <em>spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP),</em> occurs as a spontaneous bacterial infection of ascitic fluid. This occurs most commonly in adult patients with liver failure (see <a href="c43.xhtml">Chapter 43</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Secondary peritonitis occurs secondary to perforation of abdominal organs with spillage that infects the serous peritoneum. The most common causes include a perforated appendix (see later discussion), perforated peptic ulcer (see <a href="c40.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>), perforated sigmoid colon caused by severe diverticulitis (see later discussion), volvulus of the colon (see later discussion), and strangulation of the small intestine (see later discussion). The major focus of this section is on secondary peritonitis.</span></li>
<li><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1298" title="1298"></span>Tertiary peritonitis occurs as a result of a superinfection in a patient who is immunocompromised. Tuberculous peritonitis in a patient with AIDS is an example of tertiary peritonitis; these are rare causes of peritonitis.</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1713">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Secondary peritonitis is caused by leakage of contents from abdominal organs into the abdominal cavity, usually as a result of inflammation, infection, ischemia, trauma, or tumor perforation. Bacterial proliferation occurs. Edema of the tissues results, and exudation of fluid develops in a short time. Fluid in the peritoneal cavity becomes turbid with increasing amounts of protein, white blood cells, cellular debris, and blood. The immediate response of the intestinal tract is hypermotility, soon followed by paralytic ileus with an accumulation of air and fluid in the bowel (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1714">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the inflammation. The early clinical manifestations of peritonitis frequently are the signs and symptoms of the disorder causing the condition (e.g., manifestations of infection). At first, pain is diffuse but then becomes constant, localized, and more intense over the site of the pathologic process (site of maximal peritoneal irritation). Movement usually aggravates the pain. The affected area of the abdomen becomes extremely tender and distended, and the muscles become rigid. Rebound tenderness may be present. Usually, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting occur and peristalsis is diminished, followed by paralytic ileus. An initial temperature of 37.8&#x00B0; to 38.3&#x00B0;C (100&#x00B0; to 101&#x00B0;F) can be expected, along with an increased pulse rate. With progression of the condition, patients may become hypotensive and oliguric or anuric. Without swift and decisive intervention, clinical manifestations will mirror those of sepsis and septic shock (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1715">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The white blood cell count is elevated (&#x003E; 11,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) and may demonstrate a relative increase in the bands (i.e., immature neutrophils), consistent with bacterial infection (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>). The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may be low if blood loss has occurred. Serum electrolyte studies may reveal altered levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride. Blood chemistry panels and arterial blood gases may reveal dehydration and acidosis.</p>
<p class="indent">An abdominal x-ray may show free air and fluid as well as distended bowel loops. Abdominal ultrasound may reveal <strong>abscesses</strong> (localized collection of purulent material surrounded by inflamed tissues) and fluid collections, and ultrasound-guided aspiration may assist in easier placement of drains. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen may show abscess formation. Peritoneal aspiration and culture and sensitivity studies of the aspirated fluid may reveal infection and identify the causative organisms. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis may be indicated for the patient with ascites. MRI may be used for diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscesses (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1716">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid, colloid, and electrolyte replacement is the major focus of medical management. The administration of several liters of an isotonic solution is prescribed. Hypovolemia occurs because massive amounts of fluid and electrolytes move from the intestinal lumen into the peritoneal cavity and deplete the fluid in the vascular space.</p>
<p class="indent">Analgesic medications are prescribed for pain. Antiemetic agents are given as prescribed for nausea and vomiting. Intestinal intubation and suction assist in relieving abdominal distention and in promoting intestinal function. Fluid in the abdominal cavity can cause pressure that restricts expansion of the lungs and causes respiratory distress. Oxygen therapy by nasal cannula or mask generally promotes adequate oxygenation, but airway intubation and ventilatory assistance occasionally are required.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotic therapy is initiated early in the treatment of peritonitis. Large doses of a broad-spectrum antibiotic are given IV until the specific organism causing the infection is identified and appropriate antibiotic therapy can be initiated.</p>
<p class="indent">The main focus of treatment in secondary peritonitis is to identify and control the source of infection, maintain organ function, and prevent complications (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>). Treatment is multidisciplinary and involves hemodynamic support, fluid and electrolyte replacement, systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics, and nutritional support. Control of the source of infection can be treated surgically and nonsurgically depending on the patient&#x2019;s condition and underlying pathology. Nonsurgical treatment includes percutaneous drainage of abscesses and endoscopic stent placement. In select instances, ultrasound-guided and CT-guided peritoneal drainage of abdominal and extraperitoneal abscesses has allowed for avoidance or delay of surgical therapy until the acute septic process has subsided (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Daley, 2019</a>). Surgical treatment is directed toward excision (e.g., appendix), resection with or without anastomosis (e.g., intestine), repair (e.g., perforation), and drainage (e.g., abscess). With extensive sepsis, a fecal diversion may need to be created (see later discussions). Antibiotic therapy is continued postoperatively.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1717"><img class="m" src="images/icon17-fat.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Intensive care is needed for the patient with septic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Signs indicating that peritonitis is subsiding include a decrease in temperature and pulse rate, softening of the abdomen, return of peristaltic sounds, passing of flatus, and bowel movements. The nurse increases fluid and food intake gradually and reduces parenteral fluids as prescribed. A worsening clinical condition may indicate a complication, and the nurse must prepare the patient for emergency surgery. The nursing management of a patient treated for secondary peritonitis is based upon the patient&#x2019;s primary diagnosis and treatment (see later discussions of Nursing Management of Patients with Appendicitis, Diverticular Disease, and Intestinal Obstruction).</p>
