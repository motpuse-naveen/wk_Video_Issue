<h4 class="h4" id="s247">Magnesium Imbalances</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Magnesium (Mg<sup>++</sup>) is an abundant intracellular cation. It acts as an activator for many intracellular enzyme systems and plays a role in both carbohydrate and protein metabolism. The normal serum magnesium level is 1.8 to 2.6 mg/dL (0.74 to 1.07 mmol/L) (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Approximately one third of serum magnesium is bound to protein; the remaining two thirds exist as free cations&#x2014;the active component (Mg<sup>++</sup>). Magnesium balance is important in neuromuscular function. Because magnesium acts directly on the myoneural junction, variations in the serum level affect neuromuscular irritability and contractility. For example, an excess of magnesium diminishes the excitability of the muscle cells, whereas a deficit increases neuromuscular irritability and contractility. Magnesium produces its sedative effect at the neuromuscular junction, probably by inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It also increases the stimulus threshold in nerve fibers. Magnesium imbalances are magnesium deficit and magnesium excess (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>) (<a href="#tt10-9">Table&#x00A0;10-9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Magnesium also affects the cardiovascular system, acting peripherally to produce vasodilation and decreased peripheral resistance. Most magnesium in the body is stored within bone, whereas magnesium ions in the blood are bound to protein, such as albumin, or free as Mg<sup>++</sup> ions (Yu, 2019a).</p>

<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s248">Magnesium Deficit (Hypomagnesemia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hypomagnesemia refers to a below-normal serum magnesium concentration and is frequently associated with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Magnesium is similar to calcium in two aspects: (1) it is the ionized fraction of magnesium that is primarily involved in neuromuscular activity and other physiologic processes, and (2) magnesium levels should be evaluated in combination with albumin levels. Because about 30% of magnesium is protein bound, principally to albumin, a decreased serum albumin level can reduce the measured total magnesium concentration; however, it does not reduce the ionized plasma magnesium concentration. Magnesium is essential for the function of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, and low Mg<sup>++</sup> levels have effects on intracellular influxes of K<sup>+</sup> and myocardial ion fluxes (Norris, 2019; Yu, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s249">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An important route of magnesium loss is the GI tract; such loss can occur with nasogastric suction, diarrhea, or fistulas. Because fluid from the lower GI tract has a higher concentration of magnesium (10 to 14 mEq/L) than fluid from the upper tract (1 to 2 mEq/L), losses from diarrhea and intestinal fistulas are more likely to induce magnesium deficit than are those from gastric suction. Although magnesium losses are relatively small in nasogastric suction, hypomagnesemia occurs if losses are prolonged and magnesium is not replaced through IV infusion. Because the distal small bowel is the major site of magnesium absorption, any disruption in small bowel function (e.g., intestinal resection or inflammatory bowel disease) can lead to hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is a common yet often overlooked imbalance in acutely and critically ill patients. Studies suggest that up to 65% of patients in intensive care are magnesium deficient (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib835">Upala, Jaruvongvanich, Wijarnpreecha, et al., 2016</a>). Hypomagnesemia may occur with withdrawal from alcohol and administration of tube feedings or parenteral nutrition (Yu, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic alcohol abuse is a major cause of symptomatic hypomagnesemia in the United States. The serum magnesium level should be measured at least every 2 or 3 days in patients undergoing withdrawal from alcohol. The level may be normal on admission but may decrease as a result of metabolic changes, such as the intracellular shift of magnesium associated with IV glucose administration (Yu, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">During nutritional replacement, the major cellular electrolytes move from the serum to intracellular compartments of newly synthesized cells. Therefore, if the enteral or parenteral feeding formula is deficient in magnesium content, serious hypomagnesemia can occur. Because of this, serum magnesium levels should be measured at regular intervals in patients who are receiving parenteral or enteral feedings, especially those who have undergone a period of starvation (Yu, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Other causes of hypomagnesemia include the administration of aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, cisplatin, diuretics, digitalis, proton pump inhibitors, and amphotericin, as well as the rapid administration of citrated blood, especially to patients with renal or hepatic disease. Magnesium deficiency often occurs in DKA, secondary to increased renal excretion during osmotic diuresis and shifting of magnesium into the cells with insulin therapy (Yu, 2019a). A magnesium IV solution can be used to counteract seizures due to preeclampsia or eclampsia, the cardiac arrhythmia torsades de pointes, asthma, and hypertension (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s250">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical signs and symptoms can be found in <a href="#tt10-9">Table&#x00A0;10-9</a>. Some clinical manifestations of hypomagnesemia are due directly to the low serum magnesium level; others are due to secondary changes in potassium and calcium metabolism. Symptoms do not usually occur until the serum magnesium level has dropped to less than 1.8 mEq/L (0.75 mmol/L). Chvostek and Trousseau signs (see earlier discussion) occur, in part, because of accompanying hypocalcemia (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hypomagnesemia may be accompanied by marked alterations in psychological status. Apathy, depressed mood, apprehension, and extreme agitation have been noted, as well as ataxia, dizziness, insomnia, and confusion. At times, delirium, auditory or visual hallucinations, and frank psychoses may occur (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Yarlagadda, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Magnesium deficiency can disturb the ECG by prolonging the QRS, depressing the ST segment, and predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contractions, supraventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation. Increased susceptibility to digitalis <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page253" title="253"></span>toxicity is associated with low serum magnesium levels. Patients receiving digoxin are also likely to be receiving diuretic therapy, predisposing them to renal loss of magnesium. Concurrent hypokalemia and hypocalcemia must be addressed in addition to hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte disturbances are difficult to correct until magnesium has been replenished. Additionally, hypocalcemia can be worsened by isolated treatment of hypomagnesemia with IV magnesium sulfate because sulfate binds ionized calcium (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Yarlagadda, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s251">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">On laboratory analysis, the serum magnesium level is less than 1.8 mg/dL (0.74 mmol/L). Urine magnesium may help identify the cause of magnesium depletion, and levels are measured after a loading dose of magnesium sulfate is given. Additional diagnostic techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the ion-selective electrode) are sensitive and direct means of measuring ionized serum magnesium levels (Yu, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s252">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mild magnesium deficiency can be corrected by diet alone. Principal dietary sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, beans, lentils, white potatoes, wheat bran, dry roasted almonds, and peanut butter (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib804">National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If necessary, magnesium salts can be given orally in an oxide or gluconate form to replace continuous losses but can produce diarrhea. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition require magnesium in the IV solution to prevent hypomagnesemia</p>
<p class="indent">Vital signs must be assessed frequently during magnesium administration to detect changes in cardiac rate or rhythm, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Monitoring urine output is essential before, during, and after magnesium administration as this is how Mg<sup>++</sup> is excreted; the primary provider is notified if urine volume decreases to less than 100 mL over 4 hours. Calcium gluconate must be readily available to treat hypocalcemic tetany or hypermagnesemia.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Inadvertent overdosage of IV magnesium can result in serious patient harm and death. Whenever a patient is prescribed IV magnesium, a second nurse should independently double check the IV magnesium prescription, including dose calculations, and check infusion pump settings. Milligrams (mg) and grams (g) are not equivalent to milliequivalent (mEq) dosages.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s253">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should be aware of patients at risk for hypomagnesemia and observe them for its signs and symptoms. Patients receiving digitalis are monitored closely, because a deficit of magnesium can predispose them to digitalis toxicity. If hypomagnesemia is severe, seizure precautions are implemented. Other safety precautions are instituted, as indicated, if confusion is observed. Patients should be screened for dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), as this may occur in those with magnesium depletion.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient education plays a major role in treating magnesium deficit. The patient is educated about sources of magnesium-rich foods, including green vegetables, nuts, legumes, bananas, and oranges.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s254">Magnesium Excess (Hypermagnesemia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hypermagnesemia (serum magnesium level higher than 2.6 mg/dL [1.07 mmol/L]) is a rare electrolyte abnormality, because the kidneys efficiently excrete magnesium (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). A serum magnesium level can appear falsely elevated if blood specimens are allowed to hemolyze or are drawn from an extremity with a tourniquet that was applied too tightly.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s255">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common cause of hypermagnesemia is kidney injury (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Gupta, 2019</a>). In fact, most patients with advanced kidney injury have at least a slight elevation in serum magnesium levels. This condition is aggravated when such patients receive magnesium to control seizures.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypermagnesemia can occur in patients with untreated DKA when catabolism causes the release of cellular magnesium that cannot be excreted because of profound fluid volume depletion and resulting oliguria. A surplus of magnesium can also result from excessive magnesium given to treat hypertension of pregnancy or to treat hypomagnesemia. Increased serum magnesium levels can also occur in adrenocortical insufficiency, Addison disease, or hypothermia.</p>
<p class="indent">Excessive use of magnesium-based antacids or laxatives and medications that decrease GI motility, including opioids and anticholinergics, can also increase serum magnesium levels. Decreased elimination of magnesium or its increased absorption due to intestinal hypomotility from any cause can contribute to hypermagnesemia. Lithium intoxication can also cause an increase in serum magnesium levels. Extensive soft tissue injury or necrosis as with trauma, shock, sepsis, cardiac arrest, or severe burns can also result in hypermagnesemia (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Gupta, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s256">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute elevation of the serum magnesium level depresses the central nervous system as well as the peripheral neuromuscular junction. Clinical signs and symptoms can be found in <a href="#tt10-9">Table&#x00A0;10-9</a>. The respiratory center is depressed when serum magnesium levels exceed 10 mEq/L (5 mmol/L). Coma, atrioventricular heart block, and cardiac arrest can occur when the serum magnesium level is greatly elevated and not treated. High levels of magnesium also result in platelet clumping and delayed thrombin formation (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Gupta, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s257">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In hypermagnesemia, the serum magnesium level is greater than 2.6 mg/dL (1.07 mmol/L). Increased potassium and calcium are present concurrently. As creatinine clearance decreases to less than 3.0 mL/min, the serum magnesium levels increase. ECG findings may include a prolonged PR interval, tall T waves, a widened QRS, and a prolonged QT interval, as well as an atrioventricular block (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 253</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page254" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="254">p. 254</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s258">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypermagnesemia can be prevented by avoiding the administration of magnesium to patients with kidney injury and by carefully monitoring seriously ill patients who are receiving magnesium salts. In patients with severe hypermagnesemia, all parenteral and oral magnesium salts are discontinued. In emergencies, such as respiratory depression or defective cardiac conduction, ventilatory support and IV elemental calcium as a magnesium antagonist are indicated. In addition, hemodialysis with a magnesium-free dialysate can reduce the serum magnesium to a safe level within hours. Administration of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and sodium chloride or lactated Ringer&#x2019;s IV solution enhances magnesium excretion in patients with adequate renal function. IV calcium antagonizes the cardiovascular and neuromuscular effects of magnesium (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Gupta, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s259">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients at risk for hypermagnesemia should be monitored closely. If hypermagnesemia is suspected, the nurse should monitor the vital signs, noting hypotension and shallow respirations. The nurse should be aware that arrhythmias, bradycardia, and heart block can occur. The nurse also observes for decreased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), muscle weakness, and changes in the level of consciousness. Medications that contain magnesium are not given to patients with compromised renal function, and patients with kidney injury are cautioned to check with their primary providers before taking OTC supplements. Administration of fluids and diuretics are often used in treatment, and monitoring of I&#x0026;O is important. Hemodialysis may be necessary in severe hypermagnesemia, particularly if cardiovascular or neurologic manifestations are present. Hemodialysis is also necessary in patients with severe hypermagnesemia and kidney injury (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Yu &#x0026; Gupta, 2019</a>).</p>
