It may or may not be communicable (i.e., contagious). Although modern science had controlled, eradicated, or decreased the incidence of many infectious diseases, emerging novel pathogens continue to plague the globe, taxing economic and social resources, and proving hazardous to the health and well-being of patients, families, communities, and cultural systems. Examples of such threatening infectious diseases are presented in this chapter. Other infectious diseases are discussed in the appropriate chapters (e.g., see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for information on tuberculosis [TB]). It is important to understand infectious causes and the treatment of contagious, serious, common infections as well as emerging noncommon infections. <a href="c66-sec01.xhtml#tt66-1">Table&#x00A0;66-1</a> presents select infectious diseases, their causative organisms, mode of transmission, and usual <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;incubation period:&lt;/b&gt; time between contact and onset of signs and symptoms">incubation period</button></strong> (time between contact and development of the first signs and symptoms).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse plays an important role in infection control and prevention. Educating patients may decrease their risk of becoming infected or may decrease the sequelae of infection. Using appropriate barrier precautions, observing prudent hand hygiene, and ensuring aseptic care of intravenous (IV) catheters and other invasive equipment also assists in reducing infections.</p>
