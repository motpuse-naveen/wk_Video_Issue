<h4 class="h4" id="s113">Applications of Genetics and Genomics in Nursing Practice</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses who provide genetics- and genomics-related health care blend the principles of human genetics with nursing care in collaboration with other professionals, including genetic specialists, to foster improvement, maintenance, and restoration of patients&#x2019; health (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib419">Tluczek et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Genetic-related nursing practice involves the care of people who have genetic conditions, those who may be predisposed to develop or pass on genetic conditions, and those who are seeking genetic information and referral for additional genetics services. The application of genomic information has been integrated into clinical practice areas of preconception, preimplantation, and prenatal testing, newborn screening, disease susceptibility, screening and diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic decisions, and in monitoring disease recurrence (see <a href="c06-sec03.xhtml#tt6-4">Table&#x00A0;6-4</a>). In the near future, nurses will need to engage in public health efforts to improve genetic literacy within the public domain so that patients can make informed genetic-genomic related decisions (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Boerwinkel, Yarden, &#x0026; Waarlo, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses are positioned to support patients and families with genetics- and genomics-related health concerns by ensuring not only that their health choices are informed ones but by also advocating for the privacy and confidentiality of genetic and genomic information and for equal access to genetic testing and treatments. Nurses are expected to attend to the genetic and genomic health care needs of the patient (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s114">Genetics and Genomics in Health Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of a person&#x2019;s genetic and genomic health status is an ongoing process. Nurses collect information that can help identify individuals and families who have actual or potential genetics- or genomics-related health concerns or who may benefit from further genetic information, counseling, testing, and treatment. This process can begin before conception and continue throughout the lifespan. Nurses evaluate family and past medical histories, including prenatal history, childhood illnesses, developmental history, adult-onset conditions, past surgeries, treatments, and medications; this information may relate to the genetic or genomic condition at hand or to a condition being considered (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for more information on assessing past medical history). Nurses also identify the patient&#x2019;s ethnic background and conduct a physical assessment to gather pertinent genetic information. The assessment also includes information about culture, spiritual beliefs, and ancestry. Health assessment includes determining a patient&#x2019;s or family&#x2019;s understanding of actual or potential genetics- or genomics-related health concerns and awareness of how these issues are communicated within a family (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Family History Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses in any practice setting can assess families&#x2019; genetics histories to identify a genetic trait, inherited condition, or predisposition. Obtaining a thorough family health history is the first, most important tool when determining the potential risk for a genetic illness. Targeted questions are used to identify genetic and genomic conditions for which further information, education, testing, or treatment can be offered (<a href="#ct6-4">Chart&#x00A0;6-4</a>). A three-generation family history should be collected that includes ages of each family member, medical illnesses, age and cause of death, history of miscarriages or stillbirths, and ethnicity (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib355">ACOG, 2018</a>). After consultation and collaboration with other health care providers and specialists, further genetic testing and evaluation is offered for the trait or condition in question. A genetic family history is used to make a diagnosis, identify testing strategies, and establish a pattern of inheritance. Nurses can also inquire about medical conditions that are known to have a heritable component and for which genetic testing may be available. Information is obtained about the presence of birth defects, intellectual disability, familial traits, or similarly affected family members (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses need to consider the closeness of the relationship (genetic relatedness or consanguinity) among family members when assessing the risk of genetic conditions in couples or families. For example, when obtaining a preconception or prenatal family history, it is important for the nurse to ask if the prospective parents have common ancestors (i.e., are they cousins?). This is key because, as noted previously, people who are related have more genes in common than those who are unrelated, thus increasing their chance of having children with an autosomal recessive inherited condition such as cystic fibrosis. Ascertaining genetic relatedness provides direction for genetic counseling and evaluation. It may also serve as an explanation for parents who have a child with a rare autosomal recessive inherited condition or for an adult who is similarly affected.</p>
<p class="indent">When the assessment of family history reveals that a patient has been adopted, genetic- and genomic-based health assessment becomes more challenging. Every effort is made to help the patient obtain as much information as possible about their biologic parents, including their ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Questions about previous miscarriage or stillbirth are included in genetics health assessments to identify possible chromosomal conditions. Nurses can also inquire about any history of family members with inherited conditions or birth defects; maternal health conditions such as type 1 diabetes, seizure disorders, or PKU, which may increase the risk for birth defects in children; and about exposure to alcohol or other drugs during pregnancy. Maternal age is also noted; women who are 35 years of age or older who are considering pregnancy and childbearing or who are already pregnant should be offered prenatal diagnosis (e.g., testing through amniocentesis) because of the association between advanced maternal age and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. Advanced paternal age, which includes men over 40 years of age, is associated with a slightly higher risk for a child to have autism, schizophrenia, or leukemia (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib385">Mayo Clinic, 2018</a>).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Physical Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Physical assessment may provide clues that a particular genetic or genomic condition is present in a person and family. Family history assessment may serve as a guide to focus the physical assessment. For example, a history of familial hypercholesterolemia would alert the nurse to assess for symptoms of hyperlipidemias (xanthomas, corneal arcus, and abdominal pain of unexplained origin). A family history of neurofibromatosis type 1, an inherited condition involving tumors of the central nervous system, would prompt the nurse to carry out a detailed assessment of closely related family members. Skin findings such as <em>caf&#x00E9;-au-lait</em> spots, axillary freckling, or tumors of the skin (neurofibromas) would warrant referral for further evaluation, including genetic evaluation and counseling (NIH, NLM, 2019i).</p>
<p class="indent">If a genetic or genomic condition is suspected as a result of a family history or physical assessment, the nurse, as a part of their role, and in collaboration with the health care team, may initiate further discussion of genetics and genomic information, offering and discussing genetic tests, and suggesting a referral for further genetic evaluation (<a href="#ct6-5">Chart&#x00A0;6-5</a>).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Psychosocial Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Psychosocial assessment is an essential nursing component of the genetics health assessment. The assessment findings can help identify the potential impact of new genetic and genomic information on the patient and the family and how they may cope with this information (<a href="#ct6-6">Chart&#x00A0;6-6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s115">Genetic Counseling and Evaluation Services</h5>
<p class="nonindent">People seek genetic counseling for various reasons and at different stages of life. Some are seeking preconception or prenatal information, others are referred after the birth of a child with a birth defect or suspected genetic condition, and still others are seeking information for themselves or their families because of the presence of, or a family history of, a genetic condition. Regardless of the timing or setting, genetic counseling is offered to all people who have questions about genetics or genomics and their health.</p>
<p class="indent">As the contribution of genetics and genomics to the health&#x2013;illness continuum is recognized, genetic counseling will become a responsibility of all health care professionals in clinical practice. Nurses are in an ideal position to assess the patient&#x2019;s health and genetics family history and to make referrals for specialized diagnosis and treatment. They offer anticipatory guidance by explaining the purpose and goals of a referral. They collaborate with other health care providers in giving support and follow-up counseling; additionally, they coordinate follow-up and case management.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genetic Services</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic services provide genetic information, education, and support to patients and families. Medical geneticists, genetic counselors, and advanced practice nurses in genetics provide specific genetics services to patients and families who are referred by their primary or specialty health care providers. A team approach is often used to obtain and interpret complex family history information, evaluate and diagnose genetic conditions, interpret and discuss complicated genetic test results, support patients throughout the evaluation process, and offer professional and family support. Patients participate as team members and decision makers throughout the process. Genetics services enable patients and their families to learn and understand relevant aspects of genetics and genomics, to make informed health decisions, and to receive support as they integrate personal and family genetic and genomic information into daily living.</p>
<p class="indent">Genetic counseling may take place over an extended period and may entail more than one counseling session, which may include other family members. The components of genetic counseling are outlined in <a href="#ct6-7">Chart&#x00A0;6-7</a>. Although genetic counseling may be offered at any point during the lifespan, counseling issues are often relevant to the life stage in which counseling is sought (CDC, 2018b). Examples are presented in <a href="#ct6-8">Chart&#x00A0;6-8</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Providing Precounseling Information</p>
<p class="nonindent">All genetic specialists, including nurses who participate in the genetic counseling process and those with access to a person&#x2019;s genetic information, must honor a patient&#x2019;s desire for confidentiality. Genetic information should not be revealed to family members, insurance companies, employers, and schools if the patient so desires, even if keeping the information confidential is difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">Preparing the patient and the family, promoting informed decision making, and obtaining informed consent are essential in genetic counseling. Nurses assess the patient&#x2019;s capacity and ability to give voluntary consent. This includes assessment of factors that may interfere with informed consent, such as hearing loss, language differences, cognitive impairment, and the effects of medication. Nurses make sure that a person&#x2019;s decision to undergo testing is not affected by coercion, persuasion, or manipulation. Because information may need to be repeated over time, nurses offer follow-up discussion as needed (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA 2017</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The genetic service to which a patient or a family is referred for genetic counseling will ask the nurse for background information for evaluation. Genetic specialists need to know the reason for referral, the patient&#x2019;s or family&#x2019;s reason for seeking genetic counseling, and potential genetic-related health concerns. For example, a nurse may refer a family with a new diagnosis of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer for counseling or to discuss the likelihood of developing the disease and the implications for other family members. The family may have concerns about confidentiality and privacy. The nurse and the genetic specialist tailor the genetic counseling to respond to these concerns.</p>
<p class="indent">With the patient&#x2019;s permission, genetic specialists will request the relevant test results and medical evaluations. Nurses obtain permission from the patient and, if applicable, from other family members to provide medical records that document the genetic condition of concern. In some situations, evaluation of more than one family member may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of a genetic disorder. Nurses <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page137" title="137"></span>explain that the medical information is needed to ensure that appropriate information and counseling (including risk interpretation) are provided.</p>

<p class="indent">The genetic service asks nurses about the emotional and social status of the patient and the family. Genetic specialists want to know the coping skills of patients and families who have recently learned of the diagnosis of a genetic disorder as well as what type of genetic information is being sought. Nurses help identify cultural and other issues that may influence how information is provided and by whom. For example, for patients with hearing loss, a sign interpreter&#x2019;s services may have to be arranged. For those with vision loss, alternative forms of communication may be necessary. Genetics professionals prepare for the genetic counseling and evaluation with these relevant issues in mind (CDC, 2018b).</p>

<p class="h7">Preparing Patients for Genetics Evaluation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before a genetic counseling appointment, the nurse discusses with the patient and the family the type of family history information that will be collected during the consultation. Family history collection and analysis are comprehensive and focus on information that may be relevant to the genetics- or genomics-related concern in question. The genetic analysis always includes assessment for any other potentially inherited conditions for which testing, prevention, and treatment may be possible.</p>
<p class="indent">A physical examination may be performed by the medical geneticist to identify specific clinical features commonly associated with a genetic condition. The examination also helps determine if further testing is needed to diagnose a genetic disorder. This examination generally involves assessment of all body systems, with a focus on specific physical characteristics. Nurses describe the diagnostic evaluations that are part of a genetics consultation and explain their purposes.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page138" title="138"></span><p class="h7">Communicating Genetic and Genomic Information to Patients</p>
<p class="nonindent">After the family history and the physical examination are completed, the genetics team reviews the information gathered before beginning genetic counseling with the patient and the family. The genetic specialists meet with the patient and the family to discuss their findings. If information gathered confirms a genetic condition in a family, genetic specialists discuss with the patient the natural history of the condition, the pattern of inheritance, and the implications of the condition for reproductive and general health. When appropriate, specialists also discuss relevant testing and management options.</p>
<p class="h7">Providing Support</p>
<p class="nonindent">The genetics team provides support throughout the counseling session and identifies personal and family concerns. Genetic specialists use active listening to interpret patient concerns and emotions, seek and provide feedback, and demonstrate understanding of those concerns. They suggest referral for additional social and emotional support. In addition, genetic specialists discuss pertinent patient and family concerns and needs with nurses and primary health care teams so that they can provide additional support and guidance (CDC, 2018b). Nurses assess the patient&#x2019;s understanding of the information given during the counseling session, clarify information, answer questions, assess patient reactions, and identify support systems.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Follow-Up After Genetic Evaluation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As a follow-up to genetic evaluation and counseling, genetic specialists prepare a written summary of the evaluation and counseling session for the patient and, with the patient&#x2019;s consent, send this summary to the primary provider as well as other providers identified by the patient as participants in care. The consultation summary outlines the results of the family history and physical and laboratory assessments, provides a discussion of any specific diagnosis made, reviews the inheritance and associated risk of recurrence for the patient and the family, presents reproductive and general health options, and makes recommendations for further testing and management. The nurse reviews the summary with the patient and identifies information, education, and counseling for which follow-up genetic counseling may be useful (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Follow-up genetic counseling is always offered because some patients and families need more time to understand and discuss the specifics of a genetic test or diagnosis, or they may wish to review reproductive options again later, when pregnancy is being considered. Follow-up counseling is also offered to patients when further evaluation and counseling of extended family members is recommended (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During follow-up sessions, nurses can educate patients about sources of information related to genetic and genomic issues. Some resources that provide the most up-to-date and reliable genetic and genomic information are available on the Internet (see the Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
