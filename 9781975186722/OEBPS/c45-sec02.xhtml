<h4 class="h4" id="s1927">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A variety of diagnostic studies are used to evaluate the endocrine system. The nurse educates the patient about the purpose of the prescribed studies, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse notes trends in results that provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1928">Blood Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood tests determine the levels of circulating hormones, the presence of autoantibodies, and the effect of a specific hormone on other substances (e.g., the effect of insulin on blood glucose levels). The serum levels of a specific hormone may provide information to determine the presence of hypo- or hyperfunction of the endocrine system and the site of dysfunction. An example of a specific hormone that is amenable to analyzing by blood testing is thyroid hormone (i.e., T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>; see later discussion). Radioimmunoassay tests are frequently used to detect antigen levels which give additional information about hormone levels and levels of other substances (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1929">Urine Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Urine tests are used to measure the amount of hormones or the end products of hormones excreted by the kidneys. One-time specimens or, in some disorders, 24-hour urine specimens are collected to measure hormones or their metabolites. For example, urinary levels of free catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine) may be measured in patients with suspected <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pheochromocytoma:&lt;/b&gt; adrenal medulla tumor">pheochromocytoma</button></strong>, a tumor of the adrenal medulla. Several disadvantages related to urine tests that must be considered are that patients may be unable to urinate at scheduled intervals and that some medications or disease states may affect the test results (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1930">Additional Diagnostic Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Stimulation tests</em> are used to confirm hypofunction of an endocrine organ. The tests determine how an endocrine gland responds to the administration of stimulating hormones that are normally produced or released by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. If the endocrine gland responds to this stimulation, the specific disorder may be in the hypothalamus or pituitary. Failure of the endocrine gland to respond to this stimulation helps identify the problem as being in the endocrine gland itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Suppression tests</em> are used to detect hyperfunction of an endocrine organ. They determine if the organ is not responding to the negative feedback mechanisms that normally control secretion of hormones from the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Suppression tests measure the effect of a given exogenous dose of the hormone on the endogenous secretion of the hormone or on the secretion of stimulation hormones from the hypothalamus or pituitary gland.</p>
<p class="indent">Imaging studies include radioactive scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, positron emission tomography (PET), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Genetic screening is becoming more routine in the assessment of endocrine disorders (see Chart 45-1). DNA testing can be used for the identification of specific genes associated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1449" title="1449"></span>with endocrine disorders, selective targeting for drug development, and increased understanding of the function of the endocrine system. Genetic screening is used to determine the presence of a gene mutation that may predispose a person to a certain condition, the implications of which must be considered by the patient.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Metabolic and endocrine disorders that are influenced by genetic factors are complex and typically impact multiple body systems. Some examples of genetic metabolic and endocrine disorders include:</p>
<p class="Box8BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Diabetes</p>
<p class="Box8BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disorders in amino acids (e.g., phenylketonuria, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease)</p>
<p class="Box8BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., galactosemia)</p>
<p class="Box8BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disorders of fatty acid oxidation (e.g., medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency)</p>
<p class="Box8BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disorders of glycogen storage (e.g., Pompe disease, Von Gierke disease, Danon disease, Cori disease, Anderson disease, McArdle disease)</p>
<p class="Box8BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disorders of lysosomal storage disease (e.g., Tay Sachs, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick, Fabry disease)</p>
<p class="Box8BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disorders of mucopolysaccharides (e.g., Hurler syndrome, Hunter disease, Morquio syndrome)</p>
