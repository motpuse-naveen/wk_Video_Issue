<p class="nonindent">The completion of the Human Genome Project, which was an international research project focused on identifying and characterizing the DNA of the human genome, generated rapid advances in the application of genetics and genomics in health care, and stimulated the growth of translational genetic research (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib379">Khoury, Bowen, Clyne, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). This genetic revolution gave rise to understanding how genetics and genomics influence health and to the development of tests and screening tools to diagnose genetic alterations and mutations. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pharmacogenetics:&lt;/b&gt; the study of the safety and efficacy of medication administration based on a person&#x2019;s genotype">Pharmacogenetics</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, the study of the safety and efficacy of medication administration based on a person&#x2019;s genotype, preimplantation genetic testing, a testing procedure used to identify genetic alterations in embryos, and the use of biobanking, the storage of genetic material for research or personal use, are just a few examples of the advances in genetic and genomic technologies since the discovery of the human genome.</p>
<p class="indent">The anticipated rapid growth of genetics and genomics led to the creation of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), a law created to protect the privacy and confidentiality of a person&#x2019;s genetic information (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Rothstein, 2018</a>). The Precision Medicine Initiative is a national effort intended to advance personalized medicine through the understanding of genetic makeup, lifestyle, and the environment (National Institutes of Health [NIH], U.S. National Library of Medicine [NLM], 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Identification of genetic and genomic factors associated with disease, including gene&#x2013;gene function and gene&#x2013;environment interactions, contributes to the development of more effective therapies customized to that person&#x2019;s genetic makeup and the genomic profile of his or her disease. The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;genetics:&lt;/b&gt; the scientific study of heredity; how specific traits or predispositions are transmitted from parents to offspring">genetics</button></strong> (i.e., the study of heredity) generally applies to single genes and their impact on relatively rare single gene disorders, whereas <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;genomics:&lt;/b&gt; the study of the human genome, including gene sequencing, mapping, and function">genomics</button></strong> is the study of the interaction of all genes in the human <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;genome:&lt;/b&gt; the total genetic complement of an individual genotype">genome</button></strong> (i.e., the total genetic complement of a person), environmental factors, and their interactions with each other (NIH, National Human Genome Research Institute [NHGRI], 2019a). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;epigenetics:&lt;/b&gt; the study of changes in gene expression that are not directly related to changes in the DNA genetic code">Epigenetics</button></strong> refers to changes in the expression of a given gene due to environmental exposures or personal health activity rather than the alteration of a specific gene (NIH, NLM, 2019b). Over time, epigenetic influences can cause alterations to DNA. Genetic and genomic profiles allow health care providers to prescribe individualized and effective treatment for each patient, to identify and follow individuals at high risk for disease, and to avoid adverse drug reactions (NIH, NLM, 2019a). New genomic-based strategies for disease detection, management, and treatment are being utilized, making personalized medicine a reality (<a href="#tt6-1">Table&#x00A0;6-1</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">To meet the challenges of personalized medicine, nurses must understand how genetics and genomics can influence the health of the patient and the family. Nurses must stay abreast of new genetic and genomic technologies and understand how these influence treatments that support personalized medicine. Nurses are a vital link between the patient and health care services; patients often turn to nurses first with questions about a family history of risk factors, information regarding genetics, and genetic tests and interpretations. The incorporation of genetics and genomics is relevant to all aspects of the nursing process. For instance, genetics and genomics should be included in conducting health assessments, in devising nursing diagnoses (as appropriate) in planning nursing interventions that are specific to the patient and based on the patient&#x2019;s diagnosis and genetic makeup, in implementing interventions that support the identification of and in response to genetic-related health needs, and in evaluating responses to medications based on pharmacogenetics (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel on Genetic/Genomic Nursing Competencies [Consensus Panel], 2009</a>). This chapter offers a foundation for the clinical application of genetic and genomic principles in medical-surgical nursing; outlines the nurse&#x2019;s role in genetic counseling and evaluation; addresses important legal, ethical, and social issues; and provides related information and resources for nurses and patients.</p>
