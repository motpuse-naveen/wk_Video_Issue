<h4 class="h4" id="s617">Atelectasis</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;atelectasis:&lt;/b&gt; collapse or airless condition of the alveoli caused by hypoventilation, obstruction to the airways, or compression">Atelectasis</button></strong> refers to closure or collapse of alveoli and often is described in relation to chest x-ray findings and clinical signs and symptoms. Atelectasis is one of the most commonly encountered abnormalities seen on a chest x-ray (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Stark, 2019</a>). Atelectasis may be acute or chronic and may cover a broad range of pathophysiologic changes, from microatelectasis (which is not detectable on chest x-ray) to macroatelectasis with loss of segmental, lobar, or overall lung volume. The most commonly described is acute atelectasis, which occurs most often in the postoperative setting usually following thoracic and upper abdominal procedures or in people who are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page528" title="528"></span>immobilized and have a shallow, monotonous breathing pattern (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Conde &#x0026; Adams, 2018</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Smetana, 2018</a>). Excess secretions or mucus plugs may also cause obstruction of airflow and result in atelectasis in an area of the lung. Atelectasis also is observed in patients with a chronic airway obstruction that impedes or blocks the flow of air to an area of the lung (e.g., obstructive atelectasis in the patient with lung cancer that is invading or compressing the airways). This type of atelectasis is more insidious and slower in onset (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Conde &#x0026; Adams, 2018</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Stark, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s618">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Atelectasis may be described as either nonobstructive or obstructive. Nonobstructive atelectasis occurs in adults as a result of reduced ventilation. Obstructive atelectasis results from any blockage that impedes the passage of air to and from the alveoli, reducing alveolar ventilation (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Stark, 2019</a>). Obstructive atelectasis is the most common type and results from reabsorption of gas (trapped alveolar air is absorbed into the bloodstream); no additional air can enter into the alveoli because of the blockage. As a result, the affected portion of the lung becomes airless and the alveoli collapse. Causes of atelectasis include foreign body, tumor or growth in an airway, altered breathing patterns, retained secretions, pain, alterations in small airway function, prolonged supine positioning, increased abdominal pressure, reduced lung volumes due to musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders, restrictive defects, and specific surgical procedures (e.g., upper abdominal, thoracic, or open heart surgery) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Conde &#x0026; Adams, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients are at high risk for atelectasis postoperatively because of several factors. A monotonous, low tidal breathing pattern may cause small airway closure and alveolar collapse. This can result from the effects of anesthesia or analgesic agents, supine positioning, splinting of the chest wall because of pain, or abdominal distention. Secretion retention, airway obstruction, and an impaired cough reflex may also occur, or patients may be reluctant to cough because of pain (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Conde &#x0026; Adams, 2018</a>). <a href="#ff19-1">Figure&#x00A0;19-1</a> shows the mechanisms and consequences of acute atelectasis in postoperative patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Atelectasis resulting from bronchial obstruction by secretions may also occur in patients with impaired cough <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page529" title="529"></span>mechanisms (e.g., musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders) as well as in those who are debilitated and confined to bed. In addition, atelectasis may develop because of excessive pressure on the lung tissue (i.e., compressive atelectasis), which restricts normal lung expansion on inspiration (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Stark, 2019</a>). Such pressure can be produced by a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pleural effusion:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space">pleural effusion</button></strong> (fluid accumulating within the pleural space), a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pneumothorax:&lt;/b&gt; partial or complete collapse of the lung due to positive pressure in the pleural space">pneumothorax</button></strong> (air in the pleural space), or a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemothorax:&lt;/b&gt; partial or complete collapse of the lung due to blood accumulating in the pleural space; may occur after surgery or trauma">hemothorax</button></strong> (blood in the pleural space).

<h5 class="h5" id="s619">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The development of atelectasis usually is insidious. Signs and symptoms include increasing dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, and sputum production.</p>
<p class="indent">In acute atelectasis involving a large amount of lung tissue (lobar atelectasis), marked respiratory distress may be observed. In addition to the previously mentioned signs and symptoms, tachycardia, tachypnea, pleural pain, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;central cyanosis:&lt;/b&gt; bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes due to hemoglobin carrying reduced amounts of oxygen">central cyanosis</button></strong> (a bluish skin hue that is a late sign of hypoxemia) may be anticipated. Patients characteristically have difficulty breathing in the supine position and are anxious.</p>
<p class="indent">In chronic atelectasis, signs and symptoms are similar to those of acute atelectasis. The chronic nature of the alveolar collapse predisposes patients to infection distal to the obstruction. Therefore, the signs and symptoms of a pulmonary infection also may be present.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s620">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When clinically significant atelectasis develops, it is generally characterized by increased work of breathing and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypoxemia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in arterial oxygen tension in the blood">hypoxemia</button></strong> (i.e., a decrease in oxygen tension in the arterial blood). Decreased breath sounds and crackles are heard over the affected area. A chest x-ray may suggest a diagnosis of atelectasis before clinical symptoms appear; the x-ray may reveal patchy infiltrates or consolidated areas. Depending on the degree of hypoxemia, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) may demonstrate a low saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (less than 90%) or a lower-than-normal partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s621">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing measures to prevent atelectasis include frequent turning, early mobilization, and strategies to expand the lungs and to manage secretions. Voluntary deep-breathing maneuvers (at least every 2 hours) assist in preventing and treating atelectasis. The performance of these maneuvers requires the patient to be alert and cooperative. Patient education and reinforcement are key elements to the success of these interventions. The use of incentive spirometry or voluntary deep breathing enhances lung expansion, decreases the potential for airway closure, and may generate a cough. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;incentive spirometry:&lt;/b&gt; method of deep breathing that provides visual feedback to help the patient inhale deeply and slowly and achieve maximum lung inflation">Incentive spirometry</button></strong> is a method of deep breathing that provides visual feedback to encourage the patient to inhale slowly and deeply to maximize lung inflation and prevent or reduce atelectasis. The purpose of an incentive spirometer is to ensure that the volume of air inhaled is increased gradually as the patient takes deeper and deeper breaths.</p>
<p class="indent">Incentive spirometers are available in two types: volume or flow. In the volume type, the tidal volume is set using the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The patient takes a deep breath through the mouthpiece, pauses at peak lung inflation, and then relaxes and exhales. Taking several normal breaths before attempting another with the incentive spirometer helps avoid fatigue. The volume is periodically increased as tolerated.</p>
<p class="indent">In the flow type, the volume is not preset. The spirometer contains a number of movable balls that are pushed up by the force of the breath and held suspended in the air while the patient inhales. The amount of air inhaled and the flow of the air are estimated by how long and how high the balls are suspended (see <a href="#ct19-1">Chart&#x00A0;19-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Secretion management techniques include directed cough, suctioning, aerosol nebulizer treatments followed by chest physiotherapy (CPT; see <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#ff20-6">Figs. 20-6</a> and <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#ff20-7">20-7</a> and further <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page530" title="530"></span>discussion of CPT principles in <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>), and bronchoscopy. In some settings, a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is used to dispense a bronchodilator rather than an aerosolized, small-volume nebulizer (SVN) (see <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> for further discussion of pMDIs and SVNs). <a href="#ct19-2">Chart&#x00A0;19-2</a> summarizes measures used to prevent atelectasis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s622">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of the treatment is to improve ventilation and remove secretions. Strategies to prevent atelectasis, which include frequent turning, early ambulation, lung volume expansion maneuvers (e.g., deep-breathing exercises and incentive spirometry), and coughing, also serve as the first-line measures to minimize or treat atelectasis by improving ventilation. Multidisciplinary, evidence-based standardized intervention programs that incorporate ICOUGH<sup>SM</sup> (see <a href="#ct19-3">Chart&#x00A0;19-3</a>) can prevent atelectasis (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1519">Moore, Conway, Thomas, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Smetana, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In patients who do not respond to first-line measures or who cannot perform deep-breathing exercises, other treatments such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP):&lt;/b&gt; positive pressure maintained at the end of exhalation (instead of a normal zero pressure) to increase functional residual capacity and open collapsed alveoli">positive end-expiratory pressure</button></strong> (<strong>PEEP</strong>; a simple mask and one-way valve system that provides varying amounts of expiratory resistance, usually 10 to 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), continuous positive airway breathing, or bronchoscopy may be used. Before initiating more complex, costly, and labor-intensive therapies, the nurse should ask several questions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Has the patient been given an adequate trial of deep-breathing exercises?</span></li></ul>

</div>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Has the patient received adequate education, supervision, and coaching to carry out the deep-breathing exercises?</span></li>
<li><span>Have other factors been evaluated that may impair ventilation or prevent a good patient effort (e.g., lack of turning, mobilization; excessive pain; excessive sedation)?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">If the cause of atelectasis is bronchial obstruction from secretions, the secretions must be removed by coughing or suctioning to allow air to reenter that portion of the lung. CPT and postural drainage may also be used to mobilize secretions. SVN treatments with a bronchodilator may be used to assist patients in the expectoration of secretions. If respiratory care measures fail to remove the obstruction, a bronchoscopy is performed. Although bronchoscopy is an excellent measure to acutely remove secretions and increase ventilation, it is imperative for the nurse to assist the patient with maintaining the patency of the airways after bronchoscopy, using the traditional techniques of deep breathing, coughing, and suctioning. Severe or massive atelectasis may lead to acute respiratory failure, especially in patients with underlying lung disease. Endotracheal (ET) intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">If the cause of atelectasis is compression of lung tissue, the goal is to decrease the compression. With a large pleural effusion that is compressing lung tissue and causing alveolar collapse, treatment may include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thoracentesis:&lt;/b&gt; insertion of a needle or catheter into the pleural space to remove fluid that has accumulated and decrease pressure on the lung tissue; may also be used diagnostically to identify potential causes of a pleural effusion">thoracentesis</button></strong> (removal of the fluid by needle aspiration) or insertion of a chest tube. The measures to increase lung expansion described previously also are used.</p>
<p class="indent">Management of chronic atelectasis focuses on removing the cause of the obstruction of the airways or the compression of the lung tissue. For example, bronchoscopy may be used to open an airway obstructed by lung cancer or a nonmalignant lesion, and the procedure may involve cryotherapy or laser therapy. If the atelectasis is a result of obstruction caused by lung cancer, an airway stent or radiation therapy to shrink a tumor may be used to open the airways and provide ventilation to the collapsed area. However, reopening the airways and reaerating the area of the lung may not be possible in patients who have experienced chronic, long-term collapse. In some cases, surgical management may be indicated.</p>
