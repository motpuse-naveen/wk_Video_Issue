<h4 class="h4" id="s2262">Other Continent Urinary Diversion Procedures</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Another type of continent urinary diversion is the Indiana pouch, created for the patient whose bladder is removed (<a href="#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). The Indiana pouch uses a segment of the ileum and cecum to form the reservoir for urine (see <a href="#ff49-9">Fig.&#x00A0;49-9</a>). The ureters are tunneled through the muscular bands of the intestinal pouch and anastomosed. The reservoir is made continent by narrowing the efferent portion of the ileum and sewing the terminal ileum to the subcutaneous tissue, forming a continent stoma flush with the skin. The pouch is sewn to the anterior abdominal wall around a cecostomy tube. Urine collects in the pouch until a catheter is inserted and the urine is drained.</p>
<p class="indent">The pouch must be drained at regular intervals by a catheter to prevent absorption of metabolic waste products from the urine, reflux of urine to the ureters, and UTI. Postoperative nursing care of the patient with a continent ileal urinary pouch is similar to nursing care of the patient with an ileal conduit. However, these patients usually have additional drainage tubes (cecostomy catheter from the pouch, stoma catheter exiting from the stoma, ureteral stents, and Penrose drain, as well as a urethral catheter). All drainage tubes must be carefully monitored for patency and amount and type of drainage. In the immediate postoperative period, the cecostomy tube is irrigated two or three times daily to remove mucus and prevent blockage.</p>

<p class="indent">Other variations of continent urinary reservoirs are used occasionally (<a href="#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). With these methods, the pouch must be drained at regular intervals by inserting a catheter.</p>

<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse40"><strong>The Patient Undergoing Urinary Diversion Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Preoperative Assessment</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The following are key preoperative nursing assessment concerns:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cardiopulmonary function assessments are performed because patients undergoing cystectomy are often older adults who may be at greater risk for cardiac and respiratory complications.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A nutritional status assessment is important because of possible poor nutritional intake related to underlying health problems.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Learning needs are assessed in consultation with a WOC nurse to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s and the family&#x2019;s understanding of the procedure as well as the changes in physical structure and function that result from the surgery. The patient&#x2019;s self-concept and self-esteem are assessed in addition to methods for coping with stress and loss. The patient&#x2019;s mental status, manual dexterity and coordination, vision, and preferred method of learning are noted because they affect postoperative self-care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1633" title="1633"></span><strong>Preoperative Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, preoperative nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with anticipated losses associated with the surgical procedure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional intake associated with inadequate nutritional ingestion</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about the surgical procedure and postoperative care</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Preoperative Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include relief of anxiety; improved preoperative nutritional status; and increased knowledge about the surgical procedure, expected outcomes, and postoperative care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Preoperative Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The threat of cancer and removal of the bladder create anxiety related to changes in body image. Patients may face problems adapting to an external appliance, a stoma, a surgical incision, and altered toileting habits. Men must also adapt to sexual impotency; a penile implant is considered if the patient is a candidate for the procedure. Women also have anxiety related to altered appearance, body image, and self-esteem. A supportive approach, both physical and psychosocial, is needed and includes assessing the patient&#x2019;s self-concept and manner of coping with stress and loss; helping the patient to identify ways to maintain their lifestyle and independence with as few changes as possible; and encouraging the patient to express fears and anxieties about the ramifications of the upcoming surgery. Support services are available through ostomy societies and agencies, and can provide emotional support and make adaptation easier both before and after surgery (see Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NSURING</small> A<small>DEQUATE</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A low-residue diet is prescribed to cleanse the bowel to minimize fecal stasis, decompress the bowel, and minimize postoperative ileus. In addition, antibiotic medications are given to reduce pathogenic flora in the bowel and to reduce the risk of infection. Because the patient undergoing a urinary diversion procedure for cancer may be severely malnourished due to the tumor, previous treatments, and anorexia, enteral or parenteral nutrition may be prescribed to promote healing. Adequate preoperative hydration is imperative to ensure urine flow during surgery and to prevent hypovolemia during the prolonged surgical procedure.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>XPLAINING</small> S<small>URGERY AND</small> I<small>TS</small> E<small>FFECTS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Participation of a WOC nurse in patient education and care is invaluable for informed preoperative education and postoperative planning. Explanations of the surgical procedure, the appearance of the stoma, the rationale for preoperative bowel preparation, the reasons for wearing a collection device, and the anticipated effects of the surgery on sexual functioning are part of patient education. The placement of the stoma site is planned preoperatively with the patient standing, sitting, and lying down to locate the stoma away from bony prominences, skin creases, and folds. The stoma should also be placed away from old scars, the umbilicus, and the belt line.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For ease of self-care, the patient must be able to see and reach the site comfortably. The site is marked with indelible ink so that it can be located easily during surgery. The patient is assessed for allergies or sensitivity to tape or adhesives. Patch testing of certain appliances may be necessary before the ostomy equipment is selected. This is particularly important if the patient is or may be allergic to latex (see Chapter&#x00A0;14, <a href="c14-sec08.xhtml#ff14-2">Fig.&#x00A0;14-2</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Preoperative Evaluation</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">To measure the effectiveness of care, the nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s preoperative anxiety level and nutritional status as well as preexisting knowledge and expectations of surgery.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Expected patient outcomes may include:</p>
<p class="ProcessNL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span>Exhibits reduced anxiety about surgery and expected losses</p>
<p class="ProcessNL2Middle"><span class="numah">a.</span>Verbalizes fears with health care team and family</p>
<p class="ProcessNL2Middle"><span class="numah">b.</span>Expresses positive attitude about outcome of surgery</p>
<p class="ProcessNL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span>Exhibits adequate nutritional status</p>

<p class="ProcessNL2Last"><span class="numah">c.</span>Practices deep-breathing, coughing, and foot exercises</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Postoperative Assessment</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The role of the nurse in the immediate postoperative period is to prevent complications and to assess the patient carefully for any signs and symptoms of complications. The catheters and any drainage devices are monitored closely. Urine volume, patency of the drainage system, and color of the drainage are assessed. A sudden decrease in urine volume or increase in drainage is reported promptly to the primary provider, because these may indicate obstruction of the urinary tract, inadequate blood volume, or bleeding. In addition, the patient&#x2019;s need for pain control is assessed regularly, as with all postoperative patients.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Postoperative Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major postoperative nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for impaired skin integrity associated with problems in managing the urine collection appliance</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with surgical incision</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired sexual functioning associated with structural and physiologic alterations</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about management of urinary function</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1634" title="1634"></span><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Peritonitis due to disruption of anastomosis</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Stoma ischemia and necrosis due to compromised blood supply to stoma</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Stoma retraction and separation of mucocutaneous border due to tension or trauma</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Postoperative Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include maintaining skin integrity, relieving pain, increasing self-esteem, developing appropriate coping mechanisms to accept and deal with altered urinary function and sexuality, increasing knowledge about management of urinary function, and preventing potential complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Postoperative Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Postoperative management focuses on monitoring urinary function, preventing postoperative complications (infection and sepsis, respiratory complications, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, fistula formation, and urine leakage), and promoting patient comfort. Catheters or drainage systems are monitored, and urine output is monitored carefully. A nasogastric tube is inserted during surgery to decompress the GI tract and to relieve pressure on the intestinal anastomosis. It is usually kept in place for several days after surgery. As soon as bowel function resumes&#x2014;as indicated by bowel sounds, the passage of flatus, and a soft abdomen&#x2014;oral fluids are permitted. Until that time, IV fluids and electrolytes are given. The patient is assisted to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent complications of immobility.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> S<small>KIN</small> I<small>NTEGRITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Strategies to promote skin integrity begin with reducing and controlling those factors that increase the patient&#x2019;s risk of poor nutrition and poor healing. Meticulous skin care and management of the drainage system are provided by the nurse until the patient can manage them and is comfortable doing so. Care is taken to keep the system intact to protect the skin from exposure to drainage. Supplies must be readily available to manage the drainage in the immediate postoperative period. Consistency in implementing the skin care program throughout the postoperative period results in maintenance of skin integrity and patient comfort. In addition, maintenance of skin integrity around the stoma enables the patient and family to adjust more easily to the alterations in urinary function and helps them learn skin care techniques.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Analgesic medications are administered liberally postoperatively to relieve pain and promote comfort, thereby allowing the patient to turn, cough, and perform deep-breathing exercises. Patient-controlled analgesia and regular administration of analgesic agents around the clock are two options that may be used to ensure adequate pain relief. A pain intensity scale is used to evaluate the adequacy of the medication and the approach to pain management. See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion of pain management.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> B<small>ODY</small> I<small>MAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient&#x2019;s ability to cope with the changes associated with the surgery depends to some degree on their body image and self-esteem before the surgery and the support and reaction of others. Allowing the patient to express concerns and anxious feelings can help, especially in adjusting to the changes in toileting habits. The nurse can also help improve the patient&#x2019;s self-concept by educating about skills needed to be independent in managing the urinary drainage devices. Education about ostomy care is conducted in a private setting to encourage the patient to ask questions without fear of embarrassment. Explaining why the nurse must wear gloves when performing ostomy care can prevent the patient from misinterpreting the use of gloves as a sign of aversion to the stoma.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>XPLORING</small> S<small>EXUALITY</small> I<small>SSUES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients who experience altered sexual function as a result of the surgical procedure may mourn this loss. Encouraging the patient and partner to share their feelings about this loss with each other and acknowledging the importance of sexual function and expression may encourage the patient and partner to seek sexual counseling and to explore alternative ways of expressing sexuality. Using the support and expertise from another patient with an ostomy who is functioning fully in society and family life may also assist the patient and family in recognizing that full recovery is possible.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> MA<small>NAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Complications are not unusual because of the complexity of the surgery, the underlying reason (cancer, trauma) for the urinary diversion procedure, and the patient&#x2019;s frequently less-than-optimal nutritional status. Complications may include respiratory disorders (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia), fluid and electrolyte imbalances, breakdown of any anastomosis, sepsis, fistula formation, fecal or urine leakage, and skin irritation. If these occur, the patient will remain hospitalized for an extended length of time and will probably require parenteral nutrition, GI decompression by means of nasogastric suction, and further surgery. The goals of management are to establish drainage, provide adequate nutrition for healing to occur, and prevent sepsis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Peritonitis.</span> Peritonitis can occur postoperatively if urine leaks at the anastomosis. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain and distention, muscle rigidity with guarding, nausea and vomiting, paralytic ileus (absence of bowel sounds), fever, and leukocytosis.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Urine output must be monitored closely, because a sudden decrease in output with a corresponding increase in drainage from the incision or drains may indicate urine leakage. In addition, the urine drainage device is observed for leakage. The pouch is changed if a leak is observed. Small leaks in the anastomosis may seal themselves, but surgery may be needed for larger leaks.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, temperature) are monitored. Changes in vital signs, as well as increasing pain, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal distention, are reported and may indicate peritonitis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Stoma Ischemia and Necrosis.</span> The stoma is monitored because ischemia and necrosis of the stoma can result from tension on the mesentery blood vessels, twisting of the bowel segment (conduit) during surgery, or arterial insufficiency. The new stoma must be inspected at least <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1635" title="1635"></span>every 4 hours to assess the adequacy of its blood supply. The stoma should be red or pink. If the blood supply to the stoma is compromised, the color changes to purple, brown, or black. These changes are reported immediately. The surgeon or WOC nurse may insert a small, lubricated tube into the stoma and shine a flashlight into the lumen of the tube to assess for superficial ischemia or necrosis. A necrotic stoma requires surgical intervention. If the ischemia is superficial, the dusky stoma is observed and may slough its outer layer in several days.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Stoma Retraction and Separation.</span> Stoma retraction and separation of the mucocutaneous border can occur as a result of trauma or tension on the internal bowel segment used for creation of the stoma. In addition, mucocutaneous separation can occur if the stoma does not heal as a result of accumulation of urine on the stoma and mucocutaneous border. Using a collection drainage pouch with an antireflux valve is helpful because the valve prevents urine from pooling on the stoma and mucocutaneous border. Meticulous skin care to keep the area around the stoma clean and dry promotes healing. If a separation of the mucocutaneous border occurs, surgery is not usually needed. The separated area is protected by applying karaya powder, stoma adhesive paste, and a properly fitted skin barrier and pouch. By protecting the separation, healing is promoted. If the stoma retracts into the peritoneum, surgical intervention is mandatory.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If surgery is needed to manage these complications, the nurse provides explanations to the patient and family. The need for additional surgery is usually perceived as a setback by the patient and family. Emotional support of the patient and family is provided along with physical preparation of the patient for surgery.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY-BASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL CARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> A major postoperative objective is to assist the patient to achieve the highest level of independence and self-care possible. The nurse and WOC nurse work closely with the patient and family to educate and assist them in all phases of managing the ostomy. Adequate supplies and complete instruction are necessary to enable the patient and a family member to develop competence and confidence in their skills. Written and verbal instructions are provided, and the patient is encouraged to contact the nurse or primary provider with follow-up questions. Follow-up telephone calls from the nurse to the patient and family after discharge may provide added support and provide another opportunity to answer their questions. Follow-up visits and reinforcement of correct skin care and appliance management techniques also promote skin integrity. Specific techniques for managing the appliance are described in <a href="c49-sec15.xhtml#ct49-13">Chart&#x00A0;49-13</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is encouraged to participate in decisions regarding the type of collecting appliance and the time of day to change the appliance. The patient is assisted and encouraged to look at and touch the stoma early to overcome any fears. The patient and family need to know the characteristics of a normal stoma:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Pink or red and moist, like the inside of the mouth</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Insensitive to pain because it has no nerve endings</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Vascular, which means it may bleed when cleaned</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, if a segment of the GI tract was used to create the urinary diversion, mucus may be visible in the urine. By learning what is normal, the patient and family become familiar with what signs and symptoms they should report and what problems they can handle themselves.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Information provided to the patient and the extent of involvement in self-care are determined by the patient&#x2019;s physical recovery and ability to accept and acquire the knowledge and skill needed for independence. Verbal and written instructions are provided, and the patient is given the opportunity to practice and demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed to manage urinary drainage.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Follow-up care is essential to determine how the patient has adapted to the changes in body image and lifestyle adjustments. Visits from a nurse are important to assess the patient&#x2019;s adaptation to the home setting and management of the ostomy. Education and reinforcement may assist the patient and family to cope with altered urinary function. It is important to assess for long-term complications that may occur, such as pouch leakage or rupture, stone formation, stenosis of the stoma, deterioration in kidney function, or incontinence.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Long-term monitoring for anemia is performed to identify vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, which may occur when a significant portion of the terminal ileum is removed. This may take several years to develop and can be treated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections. The patient and family are informed about the United Ostomy Associations of America (UOAA) and any local ostomy support groups to provide ongoing support, assistance, and education (see Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
