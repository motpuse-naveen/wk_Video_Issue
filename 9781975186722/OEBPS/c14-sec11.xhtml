<p class="nonindent">The nurse confirms the patient identity upon entry and dons &#x201C;alert&#x201D; bracelets on the patient when applicable: medication allergies, fall risk, extremity precautions (for needle sticks and blood pressures), and code status. The patient changes into a hospital gown, covers the head with a disposable bouffant, and nail polish is removed (if present) as it may interfere with hemodynamic monitoring. The mouth is inspected, and dentures or plates are removed. If left in the mouth, these items could easily fall to the back of the throat during induction of anesthesia and cause respiratory obstruction.</p>
<p class="indent">Jewelry is not worn to the OR; wedding rings and jewelry or body piercings should be removed to prevent injury. If a patient objects to removing jewelry, the patient must be notified of the risks associated with it. All articles of value, including assistive devices, dentures, glasses, and prosthetic devices, are given to family members or are labeled clearly with the patient&#x2019;s name and stored in a safe and secure place according to the institution&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p class="indent">All patients (except those with urologic disorders) should void immediately before going to the OR. This is particularly important in promoting visibility of anatomy and continence during low abdominal surgery. Urinary catheterization is performed in the OR only as necessary.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s481">Administering Medication</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The use of preanesthetic medication is minimal with ambulatory or outpatient surgery but may be used to help some patients remain calm and comfortable (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Phillips, 2017</a>). If a preanesthetic medication is given, the patient is kept in bed with the side rails raised, because the medication can cause lightheadedness or drowsiness. During this time, the nurse observes the patient for any untoward reaction to the medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotics are given preoperatively, as needed, to help reduce the risk of SSIs. The antibiotic is typically prescribed prior to the patient arriving and is prepared by the pharmacy so that it can be administered in a timely fashion prior to surgery. Administration of the appropriate antibiotic should occur so that the peak efficacy of the medication is in the patient&#x2019;s tissues and bloodstream immediately before incision (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Bashaw &#x0026; Keister, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s482">Maintaining the Preoperative Record</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative checklists contain critical elements that must be checked and verified before the procedure (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). The nurse completes a preoperative checklist (see <a href="#ff14-3">Fig.&#x00A0;14-3</a>). The completed medical record (with the preoperative checklist and verification form) accompanies the patient to the OR with the surgical consent form attached, along with all laboratory reports and nurses&#x2019; records. These documents may also be found in the patient&#x2019;s electronic health record; however, they must be easily accessed and verified by the surgical team. Any patient alerts (allergies, safety precautions) and individual needs are &#x201C;flagged&#x201D; on either the paper or electronic record.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Rosenkilde, C., Vamosi, M., Lauridsen, J. T., et&#x00A0;al. (2017). Efficacy of prewarming with a self-warming blanket for the prevention of unintended perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. <em>Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>32</em>(5), 419&#x2013;428.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Unintended perioperative hypothermia (UPH) is defined as a core temperature of less than 36&#x00B0;C (96.8&#x00B0;F) in patients in the surgical setting when cooling is not associated with the procedure. Many risks are associated with UPH including increased wound infections, pain, coagulation disorders, and cardiac complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate UPH rates when a self-warming blanket was utilized by patients undergoing hip or knee joint replacement surgeries.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a secondary analysis of two cross-sectional studies. A control group of patients did not receive any warming methods, and another group of patients received a prewarming intervention. Core temperatures of both groups were taken preoperatively, every 30 minutes throughout the procedure, and postoperatively.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Sixty patients were included in the study, 30 in each group. The incidence of UPH was identified in 13% of the patients in the prewarmed group and 43% of the patients in the control group. Mean core temperature in the prewarmed group was significantly higher and remained above 36&#x00B0;C in the perioperative period.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Careful attention needs to be paid to maintaining normothermia in the patient throughout the entire perioperative phase of care. The findings of this study showed a reduction in UPH rates when patients were prewarmed with a self-warming blanket. Nurses at both outpatient and inpatient surgical settings could use this study to help develop interdisciplinary prewarming techniques and protocols.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s483">Preoperative Patient Warming</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative patient warming for a period of at least 30 minutes can be beneficial to prevent hypothermia development after anesthesia induction. Various techniques include warm blankets, forced air warming, and warmed IV fluid administration. Unintended hypothermia is associated with increased adverse patient outcomes, including bleeding, delayed surgical wound healing, increased length of stay (LOS) in the PACU, cardiac dysfunction, and longer inpatient hospital stay (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Williams, 2018</a>). Patients should be educated about the purpose of the warming intervention and should be assessed for abnormal temperatures, profuse sweating, and discomfort (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Williams, 2018</a>). Research suggests that nurses play a crucial part in the reduction of unintended hypothermia, below 36&#x00B0;C (96.8&#x00B0;F), by applying prewarming techniques in the preoperative area (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1248">Rosenkilde, Vamosi, Lauridsen, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct14-8">Chart&#x00A0;14-8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is taken to the preoperative area, greeted by name, and positioned comfortably on the stretcher or bed. The surrounding area should be kept quiet if the preoperative medication is to have maximal effect. Unpleasant sounds or conversation should be avoided, because a patient who is sedated may misinterpret them.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s484">Attending to Family Needs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers have a waiting room where family members and significant others can wait while the patient is undergoing surgery. This room may be equipped with comfortable chairs, televisions, telephones, and light refreshments. Volunteers may remain with the family, offer them coffee, and keep them informed of the patient&#x2019;s progress. After surgery, the surgeon may meet the family in the waiting room and discuss the outcome.</p>
<p class="indent">The family and significant others should never judge the seriousness of an operation by the length of time the patient is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page414" title="414"></span>in the OR. A patient may be in the OR much longer than the actual operating time for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Patients are routinely transported well in advance of the actual operating time.</span></li>
<li><span>The anesthesiologist or CRNA often makes additional preparations that may take 30 to 60 minutes.</span></li>
<li><span>The preceding case may take longer than expected, which delays the start of the next surgical procedure.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">After surgery, the patient is taken to the PACU to ensure safe emergence from anesthesia. Family members and significant others waiting to see the patient after surgery should be informed that the patient may have certain equipment or devices (e.g., IV lines, indwelling urinary catheter, nasogastric tube, oxygen lines, monitoring equipment, blood transfusion lines) in place when he or she returns from surgery. When the patient returns to the room, the nurse provides explanations regarding the frequent postoperative observations that will be made. However, it is the responsibility of the surgeon, not the nurse, to relay the surgical findings and the prognosis, even when the findings are favorable.</p>
