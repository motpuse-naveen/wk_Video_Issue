<h4 class="h4a" id="s2836">ASSESSMENT OF THE EAR</h4>
<h4 class="h4" id="s2837">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The cranium encloses and protects the brain and surrounding structures, providing attachment for various muscles that control head and jaw movements. The ears are located on either side of the cranium at approximately eye level.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2838">Anatomy of the External Ear</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The external ear includes the auricle (pinna) and the external auditory canal (see <a href="#ff59-1">Fig. 59-1</a>). The external ear is separated from the middle ear by a disc-shaped structure called the <em>tympanic membrane</em> (eardrum).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Auricle</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The auricle, attached to the side of the head by skin, is composed mainly of cartilage, except for the fat and subcutaneous tissue in the earlobe. The auricle collects the sound waves and directs vibrations into the external auditory canal.</p>
<h6 class="h6">External Auditory Canal</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The external auditory canal is approximately 2 to 3 cm long (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>). The lateral third is an elastic cartilaginous and dense fibrous framework to which thin skin is attached. The medial two thirds is bone lined with thin skin. The external auditory canal ends at the tympanic membrane.</p>
<p class="indent">The skin of the canal contains hair, sebaceous glands, and ceruminous glands, which secrete a brown, waxlike substance called <em>cerumen</em> (ear wax). The ear&#x2019;s self-cleaning mechanism moves old skin cells and cerumen to the outer part of the ear.</p>
<p class="indent">Just anterior to the external auditory canal is the temporomandibular joint. The head of the mandible can be felt by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1937" title="1937"></span>placing a fingertip in the external auditory canal while the patient opens and closes the mouth.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2839">Anatomy of the Middle Ear</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The middle ear, an air-filled cavity, includes the tympanic membrane laterally and the otic capsule medially. The middle ear cleft lies between the two. The middle ear is connected to the nasopharynx by the eustachian tube and is continuous with air-filled cells in the adjacent mastoid portion of the temporal bone.</p>
<p class="indent">The eustachian tube, which is approximately 1 mm wide and 35 mm long, connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. Normally, the eustachian tube is closed, but it opens by action of the tensor veli palatini muscle when the person performs a Valsalva maneuver, yawns, or swallows. It drains normal and abnormal secretions of the middle ear and equalizes pressure in the middle ear with that of the atmosphere.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tympanic Membrane</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The tympanic membrane (eardrum), about 1 cm in diameter and very thin, is normally pearly gray and translucent (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). It consists of three layers of tissue: an outer layer, continuous with the skin of the ear canal; a fibrous middle layer; and an inner mucosal layer, continuous with the lining of the middle ear cavity. Approximately 80% of the tympanic membrane is composed of all three layers and is called the <em>pars tensa.</em> The remaining 20% lacks the middle layer and is called the <em>pars flaccida.</em> The absence of this fibrous middle layer makes the pars flaccida more vulnerable to pathologic disorders than the pars tensa. Distinguishing landmarks include the annulus, the fibrous border that attaches the eardrum to the temporal bone; the short process of the malleus; the long process of the malleus; the umbo of the malleus, which attaches to the tympanic membrane in the center; the pars flaccida; and the pars tensa (see <a href="#ff59-2">Fig. 59-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The tympanic membrane protects the middle ear and conducts sound vibrations from the external canal to the ossicles. The sound pressure is magnified 22 times as a result of transmission from a larger area to a smaller one.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ossicles</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The middle ear contains the ossicles, the three smallest bones of the body: the malleus, the incus, and the stapes (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>). The ossicles, which are held in place by joints, muscles, and ligaments, assist in the transmission of sound. Two small fenestrae (oval and round windows), located in the medial wall of the middle ear, separate the middle ear from the inner ear. The footplate of the stapes sits in the oval window, secured by a fibrous annulus (ring-shaped structure). The footplate transmits sound to the inner ear. The round window, covered by a thin membrane, provides an exit for sound vibrations (see <a href="#ff59-1">Fig. 59-1</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2840">Anatomy of the Inner Ear</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The inner ear is housed deep within the temporal bone. The organs for hearing (cochlea) and balance (semicircular canals), as well as cranial nerves VII (facial nerve) and VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve), are all part of this complex anatomy (see <a href="#ff59-1">Fig. 59-1</a>). The cochlea and semicircular canals are housed in the bony labyrinth. The bony labyrinth surrounds and protects the membranous labyrinth, which is bathed in a fluid called <em>perilymph.</em></p>
<h6 class="h6">Membranous Labyrinth</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The membranous labyrinth is composed of the utricle, the saccule, the cochlear duct, the semicircular canals, and the organ of Corti, all of which are surrounded by a fluid called <em>endolymph.</em> The three semicircular canals&#x2014;posterior, superior, and lateral, which lie at 90-degree angles to one another&#x2014;contain sensory receptor organs that are arranged to detect rotational movement. These receptor end organs are stimulated by changes in the rate or direction of a person&#x2019;s movement. The utricle and saccule are involved with linear movements.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Organ of Corti</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The organ of Corti is housed in the cochlea, a snail-shaped, bony tube about 3.5 cm long with two and a half spiral turns. Membranes separate the cochlear duct (scala media) from the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani from the basilar membrane. The organ of Corti is located on the basilar membrane that stretches from the base to the apex of the cochlea. As sound vibrations enter the perilymph at the oval window and travel along the scala vestibuli, they pass through the scala tympani, enter the cochlear duct, and cause movement of the basilar membrane. The organ of Corti, also referred to as the end organ for hearing, transforms mechanical energy into neural activity and separates sounds into different frequencies. This electrochemical impulse travels through the acoustic nerve to the temporal cortex of the brain to be interpreted as meaningful sound. In the internal auditory canal, the cochlear (acoustic) nerve, arising from the cochlea, joins the vestibular nerve, arising from the semicircular canals, utricle, and saccule, to become the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). This canal also houses the facial nerve and the blood supply from the ear to the brain.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2841">Function of the Ears</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Hearing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hearing is conducted over two pathways: air and bone. Sounds transmitted by air conduction travel over the air-filled external and middle ear through vibration of the tympanic membrane and ossicles. Sounds transmitted by bone conduction travel directly through bone to the inner ear, bypassing the tympanic membrane and ossicles. Normally, air conduction is the more efficient pathway.</p>
<p class="h7">Sound Conduction and Transmission</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sound enters the ear through the external auditory canal and causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate. These vibrations transmit sound through the lever action of the ossicles to the oval window as mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then transmitted through the inner ear fluids to the cochlea, stimulating the hair cells, and is subsequently converted to electrical energy. The electrical energy travels through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the central nervous system, where it is interpreted in its final form as sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Vibrations transmitted by the tympanic membrane to the ossicles of the middle ear are transmitted to the cochlea, located in the labyrinth of the inner ear. The stapes rocks, causing vibrations (waves) in fluids contained in the inner ear. These fluid waves cause movement of the basilar membrane, stimulating the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea to move in a wavelike manner. The movements of the tympanic membrane initiate electrical currents that stimulate the various areas of the cochlea. The hair cells generate neural impulses that are encoded and then transferred to the auditory cortex in the brain, where they are decoded into a sound message.</p>
<p class="indent">The footplate of the stapes receives impulses transmitted by the incus and the malleus from the tympanic membrane. The round window, which opens on the opposite side of the cochlear duct, is protected from sound waves by the intact tympanic membrane, permitting motion of the inner ear fluids by sound wave stimulation. For example, in the normally intact tympanic membrane, sound waves stimulate the oval window first, and a lag occurs before the terminal effect of the stimulus reaches the round window. However, this lag phase is changed when a perforation of the tympanic membrane allows sound waves to impinge on the oval and round windows simultaneously. This effect cancels the lag and prevents the maximal effect of inner ear fluid motility and its subsequent effect in stimulating the hair cells in the organ of Corti. The result is a reduction in hearing ability (see <a href="c59-sec02.xhtml#ff59-3">Fig. 59-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone conduction occurs by directly stimulating bones of the skull, which send sound to the inner ear. The way in which this occurs can be demonstrated by striking a tuning fork and placing it directly on the skull above the ear. Sound is transmitted to the inner ear.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Balance and Equilibrium</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Body balance is maintained by cooperation of muscles and joints of the body (proprioceptive system), the eyes (visual system), and the labyrinth (vestibular system). These areas send their information about equilibrium, or balance, to the brain (cerebellar system) for coordination and perception in the cerebral cortex. The brain obtains its blood supply from the heart and arterial system. A problem in any of these areas, such as arteriosclerosis or impaired vision, can cause a disturbance of balance. The vestibular apparatus of the inner ear provides feedback regarding the movements and the position of the head and body in space.</p>
