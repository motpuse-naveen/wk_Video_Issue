<h4 class="h4" id="s182">Pain Management</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Achieving optimal pain relief is best viewed on a continuum, with the primary objective being to provide both effective and safe analgesia (<a href="#bib708">Pozek, De Ruyter, &#x0026; Khan, 2018</a>). The quality of pain control should be addressed whenever patient care is passed on from one clinician to another, such as at change of shift and transfer from one clinical area to another. Optimal pain relief is the responsibility of <em>every</em> member of the health care team and begins with titration of the analgesic agent, followed by continued prompt assessment, analgesic agent administration, and nonpharmacologic interventions during the course of care to safely achieve pain intensities that allow patients to meet their functional goals with relative ease.</p>
<p class="indent">Although it may not always be possible to achieve a patient&#x2019;s pain intensity goal within the short time the patient is in an area like the PACU or emergency department, this goal provides direction for ongoing analgesic care. Important information to provide during transfer report is the patient&#x2019;s comfort&#x2013;function goal, how close the patient is to achieving it, what has been done thus far to achieve it (analgesic agents and doses and/or nonpharmacologic interventions), and how well the patient has tolerated administration of the analgesic agent (adverse effects). There is growing interest among both clinicians and researchers in linking pain management to functional goals. One effort in this work is the Clinically Aligned Pain Assessment (CAPA) Tool, which is used to assess various degrees of comfort, pain control, function, and sleep (<a href="#bib734">Topham &#x0026; Drew, 2017</a>). Pain management interventions should improve and not inhibit progress toward healing and rehabilitation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s183">Pharmacologic Management of Pain: Multimodal Analgesia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain is a complex phenomenon involving multiple underlying mechanisms that requires more than one analgesic agent to manage it safely and effectively. The recommended approach for the treatment of all types of pain in all age groups is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;multimodal analgesia or multimodal pain management:&lt;/b&gt; the intentional, concurrent use of more than one pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic intervention with different methods of action with the goal to achieve better analgesia while using lower doses of medications with fewer adverse effects">multimodal analgesia or multimodal pain management</button></strong><strong>.</strong> A multimodal regimen intentionally and simultaneously combines medications with different underlying mechanisms, along with nonpharmacologic interventions, which allows for lower doses of each of the medications in the treatment plan, reducing the potential for adverse effects. Furthermore, multimodal analgesia can result in comparable or greater pain relief with fewer adverse effects than can be achieved with any single analgesic agent (<a href="#bib655">Beverly, Kaye, Ljungqvist, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib734">Blackburn, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Routes of Administration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Oral is the preferred route of analgesic administration and should be used whenever feasible (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>). Medications administered via the oral route are generally best tolerated, easiest to administer, and most cost-effective. When the oral route is not possible, such as when patients cannot swallow, are NPO (nothing by mouth), or nauseated, other routes of administration are used. For example, patients with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page207" title="207"></span>cancer pain who are unable to swallow may take analgesic agents by the transdermal, rectal, or subcutaneous route of administration (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In the immediate postoperative period, the IV route is most often the first-line route of administration for analgesic delivery, and patients are transitioned to the oral route as tolerated (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a> for the management of postoperative pain).</p>
<p class="indent">The rectal route of analgesic administration is an alternative route when oral or IV analgesic agents are not an option (e.g., for palliative purposes during end-of-life care). The rectum allows passive diffusion of medications and absorption into the systemic circulation. This route can be less expensive and does not involve the skill and expertise required of the parenteral route of administration. Limitations are that medication absorption can be unreliable and depends on many factors including rectal tissue health and administrator technique. Some patients may be resistant to or fearful of rectal administration. The rectal route is contraindicated in patients who are neutropenic or thrombocytopenic because of potential rectal bleeding. Diarrhea, perianal abscess or fistula, and abdominoperineal resection are also relative contraindications (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The topical route of administration is used for both acute and chronic pain. For example, the nonopioid diclofenac is available in patch and gel formulations for application directly over painful areas. Local anesthetic creams, such as eutectic mixture or emulsion of local anesthetics and lidocaine cream 4%, can be applied directly over the injection site prior to painful needle stick procedures; the lidocaine patch 5% is often used for well-localized types of neuropathic pain, such as postherpetic neuralgia. It is important to distinguish between topical and transdermal medication delivery. Although both routes require the medication to cross the stratum corneum to produce analgesia, transdermal delivery requires absorption into the systemic circulation to achieve effects, whereas topical agents produce effects in the tissues immediately under the site of application (referred to as targeted peripheral analgesia). Compounding pharmacies may be consulted to custom blend antispasmodic agents, such as topical morphine or gabapentin, for topical application at the painful site.</p>
<p class="indent">A more invasive method used to manage pain is accomplished using <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neuraxial:&lt;/b&gt; of the central nervous system">neuraxial</button></strong> analgesia, which involves administering medication in the epidural or subarachnoid space (<a href="#bib607">American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, 2016</a>). Delivery of analgesic agents by the neuraxial route is accomplished by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space (for intrathecal [spinal] analgesia) or the epidural space, and either injecting the analgesic medication directly, or threading a catheter through the needle to enable bolus dosing or continuous administration (<a href="#bib734">Conlin, Grant, &#x0026; Wu, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib734">Hernandez, Grant, &#x0026; Wu, 2018</a>). Intrathecal catheters for acute pain management are used most often for providing anesthesia or a single bolus dose of an analgesic agent. Implanted intrathecal pumps deliver very small amounts of medication in a constant infusion for treatment of end-of-life pain or persistent pain (<a href="#bib734">Jamison, Cohen, &#x0026; Rosenow, 2018</a>). Temporary epidural catheters for acute pain management are removed after 2 to 4 days. Epidural analgesia is administered by clinician-given bolus, continuous infusion (basal rate), and patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). The most common opioids given intraspinally are morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone. These are often combined with a local anesthetic, most often ropivacaine or bupivacaine (<a href="#bib734">Jamison et al., 2018</a>). The multimodal use of local anesthetics with opioids improves analgesia and produces an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;opioid dose&#x2013;sparing effect:&lt;/b&gt; occurs when a nonopioid or co-analgesic medication is prescribed in addition to an opioid, enabling the opioid dose to be lower without diminishing analgesic effects">opioid dose&#x2013;sparing effect</button></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent">A pain management technique that involves the use of an indwelling catheter is the continuous peripheral nerve block (also called <em>perineural anesthesia</em>), whereby an initial local anesthetic block is established and followed by the placement of a catheter or catheters through which an infusion of local anesthetic, usually ropivacaine or bupivacaine, is infused continuously to the targeted site of innervation. The effect of local anesthetic is dose dependent: at lower doses, the smaller sensory nerve fibers are affected before the larger motor fibers. Patients thus medicated are able to walk but have well controlled pain (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Ilfeld &#x0026; Mariano, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dosing Regimen</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Achieving, then maintaining, optimal pain management that is safe, effective, and progresses toward realistic functional goals requires patient education with continuing reassessment of analgesic effect and development of any untoward effects (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>). Accomplishing these goals may require the mainstay analgesic agent to be given on a scheduled around-the-clock (ATC) basis, rather than PRN (as needed) to maintain stable analgesic blood levels when pain is continuous (<a href="#bib734">Eksterowicz &#x0026; DiMaggio, 2018</a>). ATC dosing regimens are designed to control pain for patients who report pain being present 12 hours or more during a 24-hour period. PRN dosing of analgesic agents is appropriate for intermittent pain, such as prior to painful procedures and for BTP (pain that &#x201C;breaks through&#x201D; the pain being managed by the mainstay analgesic agent), for which supplemental doses of analgesia are provided (<a href="#bib734">Palat, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Patient-Controlled Analgesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an interactive method of pain management that allows patients to treat their pain by self-administering doses of analgesic agents (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). It is used to manage all types of pain by multiple routes of administration, including oral, IV, subcutaneous, epidural, and perineural (<a href="#bib617">Fernandes, Hernandes, de Almeida, et al., 2017</a>). Current guidelines from the APS, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists strongly recommended IV PCA for postoperative pain management when it is necessary to use the parenteral route to deliver analgesic medications (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>). A PCA infusion device is programmed so that the patient can press a button (pendant) to self-administer a dose of an analgesic agent (PCA dose) at a set time interval (demand or lockout) as needed. Patients who use PCAs must be able to understand the relationships among pain, pushing the PCA button or taking the analgesic agent, and pain relief, and must be cognitively and physically able to use any equipment that is necessary to administer the therapy (<a href="#bib665">ECRI Institute Patient Safety Organization, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A basal rate (continuous infusion) may be used for patients who are opioid tolerant, and when PCEA is used. It is discouraged for patients who are opioid na&#x00EF;ve and receiving IV <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page208" title="208"></span>PCA due to the risk of oversedation with subsequent respiratory depression (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib665">ECRI Institute Patient Safety Organization, 2017</a>). Essential to the safe use of a basal rate with PCA is close monitoring by nurses of sedation and respiratory status and prompt decreases in opioid dose (e.g., discontinue basal rate) if increased sedation is detected (<a href="#bib633">Pasero, Quinn, Portenoy, et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The primary benefit of PCA is that it recognizes that only the patient can feel the pain and only the patient knows how much analgesic will relieve it. This reinforces that PCA is for patient use only and that unauthorized activation of the PCA device by anyone other than the patient (PCA by proxy) should be discouraged (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Staff, family, and other visitors should be instructed to contact the nurse if they have concerns about pain control rather than activating the PCA device for the patient.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">However, for some patients who are candidates for PCA but unable to use the PCA equipment, the nurse or a capable family member may be authorized to manage the patient&#x2019;s pain using PCA equipment. This is referred to as Authorized Agent Controlled Analgesia; guidelines are available for the safe administration of this therapy (<a href="#bib662">Cooney, Czarnecki, Dunwoody, et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Analgesic Medications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Analgesic medications are categorized into three main groups: (1) nonopioid antispasmodic agents, which include acetaminophen and NSAIDs; (2) opioid antispasmodic agents, which include, among others, morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and oxycodone; and (3) co-analgesic agents (also referred to as <strong>adjuvant analgesic agents</strong>)<strong>.</strong> The co-analgesic agents comprise the largest group and include various agents with unique and widely differing mechanisms of action. Examples are local anesthetics, some anticonvulsants, and some antidepressants (APS, 2016).</p>
<p class="h7">Nonopioid Analgesic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Acetaminophen and NSAIDs comprise the group of nonopioid analgesic agents (refer to earlier discussion of the two categories of NSAIDs; see <a href="c09-sec01.xhtml#ff9-2">Fig.&#x00A0;9-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Indications and Administration</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nonopioid medications are analgesic agents used for a wide variety of painful conditions. They are appropriate alone for mild to some moderate nociceptive pain (e.g., from surgery, trauma, or osteoarthritis) and are added to opioids, local anesthetics, and/or anticonvulsants as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen for more severe nociceptive pain (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Since acetaminophen and NSAIDs have different mechanisms of action, they may be administered concomitantly (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>). Although there is no research supporting staggering the two medications, it may be helpful for some patients. Unless contraindicated, surgical patients should routinely be given acetaminophen and an NSAID in scheduled doses throughout the postoperative course, which can be initiated preoperatively (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nonopioids are often combined in a single tablet with opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, and are very popular for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain. They are traditionally a common choice after invasive pain management therapies are discontinued and for pain treatment after hospital discharge and dental surgery when an opioid is prescribed. Many people with persistent pain also take a combination nonopioid&#x2013;opioid analgesic agent; however, it is important to remember that these combination medications are not appropriate for severe pain of any type because the maximum daily dose of the nonopioid limits the escalation of the opioid dose (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Acetaminophen is versatile in that it can be given by multiple routes of administration, including oral, rectal, and IV. Oral acetaminophen has a long history of safety in recommended doses in all age groups. It is a useful addition to multimodal treatment plans for postoperative pain (<a href="#bib734">Wick, Grant, &#x0026; Wu, 2017</a>). Findings from one research study suggest that patients who receive scheduled acetaminophen with PRN opioids will use less opioids than if they receive PRN acetaminophen plus opioids (<a href="#bib721">Valentine, Carvalho, Lazo, et al., 2015</a>). These results were supported in a more recent study evaluating opioid use among women who underwent Cesarean deliveries (<a href="#bib680">Holland, Bateman, Cole, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">IV acetaminophen is approved for the treatment of pain and fever and is given by a 15-minute infusion in single or repeated doses. It may be given alone for mild to moderate pain or in combination with opioid analgesic agents for more severe pain. The results of several research studies have been inconsistent regarding the opioid sparing effects of IV acetaminophen (<a href="#bib734">Nelson &#x0026; Wu, 2018</a>). Recommended dosing is 1000 mg every 6 hours for a maximum of 4000 mg in adult patients (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A benefit of the NSAID group is the availability of a wide variety of agents for administration via noninvasive routes. Ibuprofen, naproxen, and celecoxib are the most widely used oral NSAIDs in the United States. When rectal formulations are unavailable, an intact oral tablet or a crushed tablet in a gelatin capsule may be inserted into the rectum. The rectal route may require higher doses than the oral route to achieve similar analgesic effects (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>). Diclofenac can be prescribed in patch and gel form for topical administration, and an intranasal patient-controlled formulation of ketorolac has been approved for the treatment of postoperative pain.</p>
<p class="indent">IV formulations of ketorolac and ibuprofen are available for acute pain treatment. Both have been shown to produce excellent analgesia alone for moderate nociceptive pain, and significant opioid dose&#x2013;sparing effects when given as part of a multimodal analgesia plan for more severe nociceptive pain (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Williams, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Adverse Effects of Nonopioid Analgesic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Acetaminophen is widely considered one of the safest, best tolerated, and most cost effective of the analgesic agents (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Williams, 2018</a>). Its most serious complication is hepatotoxicity (liver damage) as a result of overdose. In the healthy adult, a maximum daily dose below 4000 mg is rarely associated with liver toxicity. Nevertheless, one manufacturer of oral acetaminophen voluntarily changed its dosing recommendations in 2011, calling for a maximum daily dose of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" title="209"></span>3000 mg (<a href="#bib713">Shiffman, Battista, Kelly, et al., 2018</a>). In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that health care professionals stop prescribing and pharmacists stop dispensing prescription combination medication products that contain more than 325 mg of acetaminophen per tablet, capsule, or other dosage unit in order to reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity (FDA, 2014). Acetaminophen does not increase bleeding time and has a low incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects, making it the analgesic agent of choice in many individuals with comorbidities. There are two potential interactions with acetaminophen that warrant caution. Acetaminophen should be avoided when consuming alcohol because the combination can result in serious liver damage; acetaminophen also should be avoided when warfarin is prescribed because it can inhibit metabolism of warfarin resulting in toxicity with bleeding risk (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">NSAIDs have considerably more adverse effects than acetaminophen, with gastric toxicity and ulceration being the most common (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The primary underlying mechanism of NSAID-induced gastric ulceration is the inhibition of COX-1, which leads to a reduction in GI-protective prostaglandins (see <a href="c09-sec01.xhtml#ff9-2">Fig.&#x00A0;9-2</a>). This is a systemic (rather than local) effect and can occur regardless of the route of administration of the NSAID. Risk factors include advanced age (older than 60 years), presence of prior ulcer disease, and cardiovascular (CV) disease and other comorbidities (<a href="#bib734">Williams, 2018</a>). In patients with elevated risks, the use of a COX-2 selective NSAID (e.g., celecoxib) or the least ulcerogenic nonselective NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen) plus a proton pump inhibitor is recommended; however, there are risks with proton pump inhibitors as well (<a href="#bib677">Gwee, Goh, Lima, et al., 2018</a>). Proton pump inhibitors may decrease the absorption of some other medications such as itraconazole and rilpivirine (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). As with all medications, it is important to frequently reassess the need for continued use and to discontinue when appropriate. GI adverse effects are also related to the dose and duration of NSAID therapy; the higher the NSAID dose and the longer the duration of NSAID use, the higher the risk of GI toxicity (<a href="#bib734">Williams, 2018</a>). A principle of nonopioid analgesic use is to administer the lowest dose for the shortest time necessary (<a href="#bib633">Pasero, Portenoy, &#x0026; McCaffery, 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">All NSAIDs carry a risk of CV adverse effects through prostaglandin inhibition, and the risk is increased with COX-2 inhibition, whether it is produced by a COX-2 selective NSAID (e.g., celecoxib) or by NSAIDs that are nonselective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2 (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac). Findings from a recent meta-analysis suggest that the risk of acute myocardial infarction is greatest during the first month of treatment with NSAIDs, with this risk developing during the first week of treatment (<a href="#bib653">Bally, Dendukuri, Rich, et al., 2017</a>). All patients prescribed NSAIDs should receive the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period to decrease risks.</p>
<p class="indent">NSAIDs can negatively impact renal function, and are associated with diminished renal prostaglandin formation, interstitial nephritis, reduced secretion of renin, and greater reabsorption of water and sodium (APS, 2016). NSAID-induced renal toxicity can occur, but is relatively rare in otherwise healthy adults who are given NSAIDs for short-term pain management (e.g., in the perioperative period); however, individuals with acute or chronic volume depletion or hypotension rely on prostaglandin synthesis to maintain adequate renal blood flow, and NSAID inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in such patients can cause acute kidney injury (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). Attention to adequate hydration is essential when administering NSAIDs to prevent this complication (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most nonselective NSAIDs increase bleeding time through inhibition of COX-1. This is both medication and dose related, so the lowest dose of nonopioids with minimal or no effect on bleeding time should be used in patients having procedures with high risk for bleeding. Options include acetaminophen, celecoxib, choline magnesium trisalicylate, salsalate, and nabumetone (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Opioid Analgesic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Although it is often used, the term <em>narcotic</em> is inaccurate and considered obsolete when discussing the use of <strong>opioids</strong> for pain management, in part because it is a term used loosely by law enforcement and the media to refer to various substances of potential abuse, which include opioids as well as cocaine and other illicit substances. Legally, controlled substances classified as narcotics include opioids, cocaine, and others. The accurate term, when discussing these agents in the context of pain management, is <em>opioid analgesics</em> (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Opioid analgesic agents are divided into two major groups: (1) <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mu agonist:&lt;/b&gt; any opioid that binds to the mu opioid receptor subtype and produces analgesic effects (e.g., morphine); used interchangeably with the terms &lt;em&gt;full agonist, pure agonist,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;morphinelike medication&lt;/em&gt;">mu agonist</button></strong> opioids (also called <em>morphinelike medications</em>) and (2) <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;agonist&#x2013;antagonist:&lt;/b&gt; a type of opioid (e.g., nalbuphine and butorphanol) that binds to the kappa opioid receptor site acting as an agonist (capable of producing analgesia) and simultaneously to the mu opioid receptor site acting as an antagonist (reversing mu agonist effects)">agonist&#x2013;antagonist</button></strong> opioids. The mu agonist opioids comprise the larger of the two groups and include morphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and methadone, among others. The agonist&#x2013;antagonist opioids include buprenorphine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol (APS, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Opioid analgesic agents exert their effects by interacting with opioid receptor sites located throughout the body, including in the peripheral tissues, GI system, and CNS; they are abundant in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. There are three major classes of opioid receptor sites involved in analgesia: the mu, delta, and kappa. The pharmacologic differences in the various opioids are the result of their interaction with these opioid receptor types (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth, Holtsman, &#x0026; Mahajan, 2018</a>). When an opioid binds to the opioid receptor sites, it produces analgesia as well as unwanted effects, such as constipation, nausea, sedation, and respiratory depression (<a href="#bib734">Arthur &#x0026; Hui, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The opioid analgesic agents that are designated as first line (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and oxycodone) belong to the mu opioid agonist class because they bind primarily to the mu-type opioid receptors. The agonist&#x2013;antagonist opioids are designated as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; because they bind to more than one opioid receptor site. They bind as <strong>agonists</strong>, producing analgesia, at the kappa opioid receptor sites, and as weak antagonists at the mu opioid receptor sites. Their propensity to antagonize the effects of mu opioid analgesic agents limits their usefulness in pain management (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). They should be avoided in patients receiving long-term mu opioid therapy because their use may trigger severe pain and opioid <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;withdrawal:&lt;/b&gt; result of abrupt cessation or rapid decrease in dose of a substance upon which one is physically dependent. It is not necessarily indicative of substance use disorder">withdrawal</button></strong> syndrome <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page210" title="210"></span>characterized by rhinitis, abdominal cramping, nausea, agitation, and restlessness.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Antagonists</strong> (e.g., naloxone, naltrexone, naloxegol) are medications that also bind to opioid receptors but produce no analgesia. If an antagonist is present, it competes with opioid molecules for binding sites on the opioid receptors and has the potential to block analgesia and other effects. Antagonists are used most often to reverse adverse effects, such as respiratory depression (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). Antagonists have been incorporated in the manufacture of some opioids in an effort to deter abuse of the opioid (<a href="#bib734">Li, 2019</a>)</p>
<p class="h8">Administration</p>
<p class="nonindent">Safe and effective use of opioid analgesic agents requires the development of an individualized treatment plan based on a comprehensive pain assessment, which includes clarifying the goals of treatment and discussing options with the patient and the family when appropriate (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>). Goals are periodically reevaluated, and changes made depending on patient response and in some cases disease progression.</p>
<p class="indent">Many factors are considered when determining the appropriate opioid analgesic agent for the patient with pain. These include the unique characteristics of the various opioids and patient factors, such as pain intensity, age, coexisting disease, current medication regimen and potential medication interactions, prior treatment outcomes, and patient preference (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>). In all cases, a multimodal approach that may rely on the selection of appropriate analgesic agents from the nonopioid, opioid, and co-analgesic agent groups is recommended to manage all types of pain (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Li, 2019</a>). <a href="#ct9-5">Chart&#x00A0;9-5</a> lists the key considerations when developing an opioid pain treatment plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Titration of the opioid dose is usually required at the start and throughout the course of treatment when opioids are given. Whereas patients with cancer pain most often <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page211" title="211"></span>are titrated upward over time for progressive pain, patients with acute pain, particularly postoperative pain, are eventually titrated downward and discontinued as pain resolves (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>; FDA, 2017; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>). The dose and analgesic effect of mu agonist opioids have no <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ceiling effect:&lt;/b&gt; an analgesic dose above which further dose increments produce no change in effect">ceiling effect</button></strong>, although the dose may be limited by adverse effects. The absolute dose given is based on a balance between pain relief and tolerability of adverse effects. The goal of titration is to use the smallest dose that provides satisfactory pain relief with the fewest adverse effects (<a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>). The time at which the dose can be increased is determined by the onset and peak effects of the opioid and its formulation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="H6">Equianalgesia.</span> The term <em>equianalgesia</em> means approximately &#x201C;equal analgesia.&#x201D; An equianalgesic chart provides a list of doses of analgesic agents, both oral and parenteral (IV, subcutaneous, and intramuscular), that are approximately equal to each other in ability to provide pain relief. Equianalgesic conversion of doses is developed from the ratio representing the difference in the potency of the two medications (<a href="#bib734">Treillet, Laurent, &#x0026; Hadjiat, 2018</a>). The information is used to help ensure that patients are not overdosed or underdosed when they are switched from one opioid or route of administration to another. It requires a series of calculations based on the daily dose of the current opioid to determine the equianalgesic dose of the opioid to which the patient is to be switched. Several excellent guidelines are available to assist in calculating equianalgesic doses (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#tt9-3">Table&#x00A0;9-3</a>).

<p class="indent"><span class="H6">Formulation terminology.</span> The terms <em>short acting, immediate release,</em> and <em>normal release</em> have been used interchangeably to describe oral opioids that have an onset of action of approximately 30 minutes and a relatively short duration of 3 to 4 hours. The term <em>immediate release</em> is misleading because none of the oral analgesic agents have an immediate onset of analgesia; <em>short acting</em> is preferred. The terms <em>modified release, extended release, sustained release, controlled release,</em> and <em>long acting</em> are used to describe opioids that are formulated to release over a prolonged period of time. For the purposes of this chapter, the term <em>modified release</em> will be used when discussing these opioid formulations.</p>
<p class="h8">Substance Use Disorder, Physical Dependence, and Tolerance</p>
<p class="nonindent">In 2013 the American Psychological Association (APA) renamed <em>addiction</em> as <em>substance use disorder</em> (SUD) (<a href="#bib695">Lo Coco, Melchiori, Oiendi, et al., 2019</a>). SUD includes a number of subcategories, including <em>opioid use disorder.</em> The terms <em>physical dependence</em> and <em>tolerance</em> often are confused with <em>substance use disorder</em>, previously understood as <em>addiction</em>; thus, clarification of definitions is important (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;physical dependence:&lt;/b&gt; the body&#x2019;s normal response to administration of an opioid for 2 or more weeks; withdrawal symptoms may occur if an opioid is abruptly stopped or an antagonist is given">Physical dependence</button></strong> is a normal response that occurs with repeated administration of the opioid, with intensity and duration dependent upon the half-life of the medication and how long it has been used. It is manifested by the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms when <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page212" title="212"></span>the opioid is suddenly stopped or rapidly reduced, or an antagonist such as naloxone is given. Withdrawal symptoms may be suppressed by the natural, gradual reduction of the opioid as pain decreases or by gradual, systematic reduction, referred to as tapering (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). Withdrawal occurs with prolonged use of opioids, regardless of whether the use of opioids is prescribed for pain management or because of SUD (<a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tolerance:&lt;/b&gt; a normal physiologic process characterized by decreasing effects of a medication at its previous dose, or the need for a higher dose of medication to maintain an effect">Tolerance</button></strong> is also a normal physiologic response that can occur with regular administration of an opioid and consists of a decrease in one or more effects of the opioid (e.g., decreased analgesia, sedation, or respiratory depression). Although it may occur in conjunction with SUD, it cannot be equated with SUD. It may be treated with increases in dose to attain the previous effect. With the exception of constipation, tolerance to the opioid adverse effects develops with regular daily dosing of opioids over several days (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Substance Use Disorder (SUD)</strong> was historically known as addiction or addictive disease, and defined as a chronic, relapsing, treatable neurologic disease. The APA has since described SUD as the impaired use of a substance, such as opioids, even while experiencing major problems, characterized by impaired control over use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving for the substance. With SUD, use of the opioid is for nontherapeutic reasons and is thus independent of pain relief. The development and characteristics of SUD are influenced by genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors (<a href="#bib608">Auriacombe, Serre, Denis, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib695">Lo Coco et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Withdrawal</strong> occurs when a medication or substance to which the body has become dependent is abruptly reduced or discontinued. This is true of prescribed medications as well as illicitly obtained substances. Withdrawal is exhibited by a cascade of unpleasant symptoms including anxiety, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, sneezing, chills, hot flashes, abdominal cramping, tremors, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, diarrhea, piloerection, and/or insomnia (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span><em>Pseudoaddiction</em> is a mistaken diagnosis of substance use disorder that occurs when a patient&#x2019;s pain is not well controlled; the patient may begin to manifest symptoms suggestive of SUD. In an effort to obtain adequate pain relief, the patient may respond with demanding behavior, escalating demands for more or different medications, and repeated requests for opioids on time or before the prescribed interval between doses has elapsed. Pain relief typically eliminates these behaviors and is often accomplished by increasing opioid doses or decreasing intervals between doses (<a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib724">Weissman &#x0026; Haddox, 1989</a>).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Pain management specialists have increasingly come to realize that the progression from prescribed opioid use to the disease of opioid SUD is poorly understood and complex. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (2014) estimated that the rates of SUD among patients with chronic pain vary widely, from 3% to 40%. A government effort to address the issue of SUD is the <em>Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016</em> which provides prevention, treatment, and rehabilitative support (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). There is real concern for adequately treating the 2 million Americans who are living with opioid SUD and the 50 million people who are living with chronic pain (<a href="#bib702">National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2019</a>). The patients in both groups need and deserve to receive informed, evidence-based, compassionate nursing care.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Opioid na&#x00EF;ve versus opioid tolerant.</strong></span> Patients are often characterized as being either <em>opioid na&#x00EF;ve</em> or <em>opioid tolerant.</em> Whereas an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;opioid na&#x00EF;ve:&lt;/b&gt; denotes a person who has not recently taken enough opioid on a regular enough basis to become tolerant to the opioid&#x2019;s effects">opioid na&#x00EF;ve</button></strong> person has not recently taken enough opioid on a regular basis to become tolerant to the effects of an opioid, an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;opioid tolerant:&lt;/b&gt; denotes a person who has taken opioids long enough at doses high enough to develop tolerance to many of the opioid&#x2019;s effects, including analgesia and sedation">opioid tolerant</button></strong> person has taken an opioid long enough at doses high enough to develop tolerance to many of the effects, including analgesia and sedation. There is no set time for the development of tolerance, and there is great individual variation, with some not developing tolerance at all. By convention, most clinicians consider a patient who has taken opioids regularly for approximately 7 or more days to be opioid tolerant (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;opioid-induced hyperalgesia:&lt;/b&gt; a phenomenon in which exposure to an opioid induces increased sensitivity, or a lowered threshold, to the neural activity conducting pain perception; it is the &#x201C;flip side&#x201D; of tolerance">Opioid-induced hyperalgesia</button></strong> (OIH) is a paradoxical situation in which increasing doses of an opioid result in increasing sensitivity to pain. The incidence of clinically significant OIH has not been determined; however, it is a serious consequence of opioid administration. At this time, it is not possible to predict who will develop OIH as a result of opioid exposure, and the mechanisms underlying OIH are largely unknown. In general, OIH is thought to be the result of changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems that produce increased transmission of nociceptive signals (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Higgins, Smith, &#x0026; Matthews, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib734">Ringkamp et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib734">Spofford &#x0026; Hurley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some experts characterize OIH and analgesic tolerance as &#x201C;opposite sides of the coin&#x201D; (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>). In tolerance, increasing doses of opioid are needed to provide the same level of pain relief because opioid exposure induces neurophysiologic changes that reverse analgesia; in OIH, opioid exposure induces neurophysiologic changes that produce pain or increase sensitivity to noxious input (APS, 2016). In other words, tolerance may be inferred clinically when opioid treatment leads to decreased sensitivity to opioid analgesia over time (in the absence of another process that would explain this), whereas OIH may be inferred clinically when opioid treatment leads to increased pain or sensitivity to pain. Patients with OIH may report an increase in pain that increases with increased dosing of opioids (APS, 2016). Recent research findings have reported the onset of postoperative OIH following intraoperative administration of opioids (<a href="#bib734">Spofford &#x0026; Hurley, 2018</a>). OIH is an area in which additional research is much needed.</p>
<p class="h8">Select Opioid Analgesic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Morphine</em> is the standard against which all other opioid medications are compared. It is used worldwide, particularly for cancer pain, and its use is established by extensive research and clinical experience. It is available in a wide variety of short-acting and modified-release oral formulations and is given by multiple routes of administration. It was the first <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page213" title="213"></span>medication to be given intraspinally and remains a first-line choice for long-term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;intraspinal:&lt;/b&gt; &#x201C;within the spine&#x201D;; refers to the spaces or potential spaces surrounding the spinal cord into which medications can be given">intraspinal</button></strong> analgesia. It is the only opioid uniquely formulated to produce analgesia for up to 48 hours following epidural administration for acute pain management (extended-release epidural morphine). Morphine is a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hydrophilic:&lt;/b&gt; a substance or medication that is readily absorbed in aqueous solution">hydrophilic</button></strong> medication (readily absorbed in aqueous solution), which accounts for its slow onset and long duration of action when compared with other opioid analgesic agents (<a href="#tt9-3">Tables 9-3</a> and <a href="#tt9-4">9-4</a>). It has two principal, clinically significant <strong>metabolites:</strong> morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). M6G may be responsible for some of the analgesic effect of morphine; accumulation of M3G can produce neurotoxicity, which necessitates switching the patient to a different opioid (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Conlin et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib734">Howard &#x0026; Brant, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Fentanyl<em>,</em> in contrast to morphine, is a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lipophilic:&lt;/b&gt; a substance or medication that is readily absorbed in fatty tissues">lipophilic</button></strong> (readily absorbed in fatty tissues) opioid and as such has a fast onset and short duration of action (see <a href="#tt9-3">Tables 9-3</a> and <a href="#tt9-4">9-4</a>). These characteristics make it the most commonly used IV opioid when rapid analgesia is desired, such as for the treatment of severe, escalating acute pain, and for procedural pain when a short duration of action is desirable. This medication is a good choice for patients with end-organ failure because it has no clinically relevant metabolites. It also produces minimal hemodynamic adverse effects; thus, fentanyl is often preferred in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, such as the critically ill (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib734">Conlin et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib734">Howard &#x0026; Brant, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Its lipophilicity makes fentanyl ideal for medication delivery by transdermal patch for long-term opioid administration and by the oral transmucosal and buccal routes for BTP treatment in patients who are opioid tolerant. Following application of the transdermal patch, a subcutaneous depot of fentanyl is established in the skin near the patch. After absorption from the depot into the systemic circulation, the medication distributes to fat and muscle. When the first patch is applied, 12 to 18 hours are required for clinically significant analgesia to be obtained; attention must be paid to providing adequate supplemental analgesia during that time. Conversely, when the patch is removed, the serum levels of fentanyl remain for a minimum of 16 hours, so it is important to not administer additional long-acting opioids during that time. Another important caution is that heat (e.g., heating pads, hot water blankets, hot tubs, fever) may increase the rate of absorption leading to serious adverse events. The patch is changed every 48 to 72 hours depending on patient response. It is important to note that the patch is not appropriate for treating acute pain or rapidly changing pain (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Howard &#x0026; Brant, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Hydromorphone</em> is less hydrophilic than morphine but less lipophilic than fentanyl, which contributes to an onset and duration of action that is intermediate between morphine and fentanyl (see <a href="#tt9-3">Tables 9-3</a> and <a href="#tt9-4">9-4</a>). This medication is often used as an alternative to morphine, especially for acute pain because the two medications produce similar analgesia and have comparable adverse effect profiles. It is a first- or second-choice opioid (after morphine) for postoperative pain management via IV PCA and is available in a once-daily modified-release oral formulation for chronic pain management. Accumulation of its neuroexcitatory metabolite hydromorphone-3-glucuronide (H3G) may occur with high-dose, long-term infusion therapy, which would necessitate a switch to another opioid (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Oxycodone</em> is available in the United States for administration by the oral route only and is used to treat all types of pain. Single-entity short-acting and modified-release oxycodone formulations are used most often for moderate to severe cancer pain and in some patients with moderate to severe noncancer pain (see <a href="#tt9-3">Table&#x00A0;9-3</a>). When it is combined with acetaminophen, the dose of oxycodone is limited by the acetaminophen dose to avoid exceeding the maximum daily dose of that agent. Oxycodone has been used successfully as part of a multimodal treatment plan for postoperative pain as well (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Oxymorphone</em> has been available for many years in parenteral formulation and more recently in short-acting and modified-release oral tablets for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain (see <a href="#tt9-3">Table&#x00A0;9-3</a>). It must be taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal), and coingestion of alcohol at the time of dosing must be avoided because food and alcohol can increase the serum concentration of the medication up to 300% (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Hydrocodone</em> is commercially available only in combination with nonopioids (e.g., with acetaminophen or ibuprofen), which limits its use to the treatment of mild to some moderate pain (see <a href="#tt9-3">Table&#x00A0;9-3</a>). It is one of the more commonly prescribed analgesic agents in the United States; however, its prescription for the treatment of persistent pain (except for breakthrough dosing) should be carefully evaluated because of its ceiling on <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;efficacy:&lt;/b&gt; the extent to which a medication or another treatment &#x201C;works&#x201D; and can produce the intended effect&#x2014;analgesia in this context">efficacy</button></strong> and safety concerns inherent in the nonopioid constituent. In the rare situation when a patient can only tolerate hydrocodone and needs a dose higher than is possible with the acetaminophen or ibuprofen combination, hydrocodone alone can be obtained from a compounding pharmacy with a prescription. In 2014, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency changed hydrocodone from a schedule III to the more restrictive schedule II classification to reduce abuse of this pain medication (<a href="#bib668">Federal Register, 2014</a>). It is now also available as two extended-release products (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Methadone</em> is a unique synthetic opioid analgesic medication that may have advantages over other opioids in carefully selected patients. In addition to being a mu opioid, it is an antagonist at the NMDA receptor site and thus has the potential to produce analgesic effects as a second- or third-line option for some neuropathic pain states. It may be used as an alternative when it is necessary to switch a patient to a new opioid because of inadequate analgesia or unacceptable adverse effects. The use of conventional equianalgesic dose conversion is not recommended when switching patients to and from methadone. Extensive guidelines on how to safely accomplish this are available elsewhere. In 2014, the APS, in conjunction with the Heart Rhythm Society and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, issued clinical practice guidelines to encourage safe use of methadone (APS, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Methadone is usually given orally but has also been given by virtually every other route of administration. Although it has no active metabolites, methadone has a very long and highly variable <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;half-life:&lt;/b&gt; the time it takes for the plasma concentration (amount of medication in the body) to be reduced by 50% (after starting a medication, or increasing its dose; four to five half-lives are required to approach a steady-state level in the blood, irrespective of the dose, dosing interval, or route of administration; after four to five half-lives, a medication that has been discontinued generally is considered to be mostly eliminated from the body)">half-life</button></strong> (5 to 100-plus hours; average is 20 hours), which makes it a good choice for the treatment of SUD; patients must be watched closely for excessive sedation, a sign of medication accumulation during this time period. (The medication is described as &#x201C;long acting&#x201D; because of its exceptionally long half-life.) When methadone is used to treat opioid use disorder, it is dosed once daily and is not intended to manage pain; acute pain management with other analgesic medications is needed in addition to daily methadone dosing. Other limitations are its propensity to interact with a large number of medications and prolong the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Some medications (e.g., clarithromycin and some antifungal medications) that inhibit CYP3A4, the enzyme that metabolizes methadone, should be avoided as they can inadvertently increase methadone levels in the blood. Despite these characteristics, methadone can be an effective and safe medication when prescribed by providers who have an appreciation of the unique characteristics of the medication and who are experienced in prescribing it (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Dual-Mechanism Analgesic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">The dual-mechanism analgesic agents tramadol and tapentadol bind weakly to the mu opioid receptor site and block the reuptake (resorption) of the inhibitory neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine at central synapses in the spinal cord and brain stem of the modulatory descending pain pathway (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Holtsman &#x0026; Hale, 2018</a>). This makes these neurotransmitters more available to counteract pain. Dual-mechanism analgesic agents have been described as providing automatic &#x201C;built-in&#x201D; multimodal analgesia because a single tablet produces an effect on more than one analgesic action site (<a href="#bib722">Varrassi, Hanna, Macheras, et al., 2017</a>). The underlying mechanisms of tapentadol and tramadol differ in that tramadol blocks the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, but tapentadol blocks the reuptake of only norepinephrine. This is pertinent because norepinephrine may play a more significant role than serotonin in the endogenous analgesia pathways. Serotonin may be the more powerful mediator of depression; low serotonin levels are associated with depression. This helps explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, which block only serotonin, are effective for the treatment of depression but not pain (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Holtsman &#x0026; Hale, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Tramadol</em> is used for both acute and chronic pain and is available in oral short-acting and modified-release formulations, including a short-acting tablet in combination with acetaminophen. It has demonstrated good efficacy for the treatment of neuropathic pain (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The medication can lower seizure threshold and interact with other medications that block the reuptake of serotonin, such as the SSRIs, putting the patient at risk for serotonin syndrome, characterized by agitation, diarrhea, heart and blood pressure changes, and loss of coordination (<a href="#bib734">Holtsman &#x0026; Hale, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Tapentadol</em> is available in short-acting and modified-release oral formulations. This medication has been shown to produce dose-dependent analgesia comparable to oxycodone. Major benefits are that it has no active metabolites and a significantly more favorable adverse effect profile (particularly GI) compared with opioid analgesic agents. These characteristics make tapentadol an attractive alternative to traditional oral opioid analgesic agents for many patients with pain (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Holtsman &#x0026; Hale, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Opioids to Avoid</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Codeine</em> is a prodrug, which means it is pharmacologically inactive when given. It must be metabolized to morphine for the patient to experience pain relief. It is estimated that 5% to 10% of patients lack the enzymatic ability to convert codeine to morphine via the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway, meaning that in this population of patients, codeine is an ineffective analgesic agent. In contrast, codeine has been associated with overdoses in some children due to rapid metabolism of the medication to morphine.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Meperidine</em> has either been removed from or severely restricted on hospital formularies for the treatment of pain in an effort to improve patient safety. However, it is an accepted practice to use it in low doses (12.5 to 25 mg IV) to treat <em>rigors</em> (shivering) associated with general anesthesia. A major limitation to the use of meperidine is its active metabolite, normeperidine, which is a CNS stimulant and can cause delirium, irritability, tremors, myoclonus, and generalized seizures. Concern for meperidine&#x2019;s neurotoxicity risks has dramatically reduced its use (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Adverse Effects of Opioid Analgesic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common adverse effects of opioids are constipation, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hypotension, and sedation. Respiratory depression, while less common, is the most serious and feared of the opioid adverse effects (<a href="#bib707">Pasero, 2009</a>). The risk of respiratory depression is increased when other medications that have depressive effects on the CNS, such as benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), alcohol, and barbiturates, are used concurrently with opioids. In surgical patients, postoperative ileus can become a major complication as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page215" title="215"></span>well (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Sheth et al., 2018</a>). Morphine lowers blood pressure by dilating peripheral arterioles and veins. In the presence of dehydration or with concomitant use of hypotensive medications, orthostatic hypotension may result (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). Long-term use of opioids may result in opioid-induced androgen deficiency and sleep disordered breathing (<a href="#bib734">Chowdhuri &#x0026; Javaheri, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib683">Hsieh, DiGiorgio, Fakunle, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib700">Nagappa, Weingarten, Montandon, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Opioids can result in delayed gastric emptying, slowed bowel motility, and decreased peristalsis, all of which result in slow-moving, hard stool that is difficult to pass. Risk is elevated with advanced age, and immobility; however, it is an almost universal opioid adverse effect (i.e., tolerance rarely develops). Constipation is a primary reason people stop taking their pain medication, which underscores the importance of taking a preventive approach and aggressive management if symptoms are detected. Prevention includes reminding patients to take a daily stool softener plus mild peristaltic stimulant for as long as they are taking opioids (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) occur following opioid administration due to medulla chemoreceptor trigger zone stimulation. PONV are among the most unpleasant of the adverse effects associated with surgery, and can have a negative impact on patient outcomes, and increase the need for nursing intervention. Guidelines from the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) recommend that all patients be evaluated for PONV risk, risk factors be reduced if possible, multimodal analgesia be provided (so that no opioid or the lowest effective opioid dose can be given), and prophylactic treatment (e.g., dexamethasone and a serotonin receptor antagonist, such as ondansetron, at the end of surgery) be given to patients with moderate risk (APS, 2016; ASPAN, 2006; <a href="#bib671">Gan, Diemunsch, Habib, et al., 2014</a>). More aggressive interventions should be utilized in patients with high risk (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>). (See <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a> for further discussion of PONV.)</p>
<p class="indent">Pruritus is an adverse effect of opioids, not an allergic reaction to them. Although antihistamines such as diphenhydramine are commonly used, and patients may report being less bothered by itching after taking an antihistamine, this may be the result of sedating effects. Any additional coadministered sedating medication can be problematic in people already at risk for excessive sedation, such as postoperative patients, because this can lead to life-threatening respiratory depression (APS, 2016). Loratadine and cetirizine are considered nonsedating histamines and might be selected. Often the most effective, safest, and least expensive treatment of pruritus is opioid dose reduction. In fact, simply decreasing the opioid dose is sufficient to eliminate or make most of the adverse effects tolerable for many patients. Opioid rotation is another possible treatment. Nonsedating analgesic agents can be added to facilitate this approach. Parenteral low dose nalbuphine, an agonist&#x2013;antagonist opioid, has been reported to be superior to placebo, control, antihistamines, and naloxone in the treatment of pruritus caused by neuraxial opioids (APS, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to dose reduction strategies, most opioid pain treatment plans include prescriptions for medications that can be used to treat adverse effects should they occur. Recent research with animals demonstrated successful prevention of opioid induced pruritis through administration of capsaicin (<a href="#bib698">Melo, Basso, Iftinca, et al., 2018</a>). Nonpharmacologic interventions may also be effective, such as the application of a cool damp cloth over affected areas to help relieve the discomfort of pruritus.</p>
<p class="indent">With the exception of constipation, as patients become opioid tolerant, an accompanying tolerance to the opioid adverse effects develops. It is reassuring for patients receiving long-term opioid therapy to know that most of the adverse effects will subside with regular daily doses of opioids over several days.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Sedation and respiratory depression.</strong></span> Most patients experience sedation at the beginning of opioid therapy and whenever the opioid dose is increased significantly. If left untreated, excessive sedation can progress to clinically significant respiratory depression. Like other opioid adverse effects, sedation and respiratory depression are dose related. In most cases (exceptions may apply at the end of life), nurses should promptly reduce opioid doses or stop titration whenever advancing sedation is detected to prevent respiratory depression (<a href="#bib707">Pasero, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>). In some patients (e.g., those with obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary dysfunction), monitoring with capnography is warranted (<a href="#bib685">Jarzyna, Junquist, Pasero, et al., 2011</a>). When supplemental oxygen is needed to maintain the patient&#x2019;s oxygen saturation, pulse oximetry may not detect hypoventilation. Patients receiving opioid therapy and supplemental oxygen can benefit from capnography, which reflects the adequacy of ventilation and airflow, in conjunction with monitoring of sedation and respiratory function (<a href="#bib734">Gupta &#x0026; Edwards, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Opioid-induced respiratory depression is dose related and preceded by increasing sedation. Prevention of clinically significant opioid-induced respiratory depression begins with the administration of the lowest effective opioid dose, careful titration, close monitoring of sedation and respiratory function and status (i.e., rate, depth, regularity, excursion) throughout therapy, and prompt dose reduction when advancing sedation is detected (<a href="#bib734">Nagappa et al., 2017</a>).</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The knowledge that excessive sedation precedes opioid-induced respiratory depression reinforces that systematic sedation assessment is an essential aspect of the care of patients receiving opioid therapy (<a href="#bib734">Gupta &#x0026; Edwards, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib707">Pasero, 2009</a>). Nursing assessment of sedation is convenient, inexpensive, and takes minimal time to perform. A simple, easy-to-understand sedation scale, developed for the assessment of <em>unintended</em> sedation, which includes what should be done at each level of sedation, is recommended to enhance accuracy and consistency of assessment, better monitor trends, and improve communication among members of the health care team (<a href="#bib734">Garcia &#x0026; McMullan, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib685">Jarzyna et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib707">Pasero, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib709">Quinlan-Colwell, Thear, Miller-Baldwin, et al., 2017</a>). <a href="#ct9-6">Chart&#x00A0;9-6</a> presents a widely used sedation scale.</p>

<p class="indent">Respiratory depression is assessed on the basis of what is normal for a particular person and is usually described as clinically significant when there is a decrease in the rate, depth, and regularity of respirations from baseline, rather than just by a specific number of respirations per minute (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>). There are many risk factors for opioid-induced respiratory depression, including older age (65 years of age or older), obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and preexisting pulmonary dysfunction, or other comorbidities (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib685">Jarzyna et al., 2011</a>). Risk is elevated during the first 24 hours following surgery and in patients who require a high dose of opioid in a short period of time (e.g., more than 10 mg of IV morphine or equivalent in the PACU). Patients who receive regularly scheduled opioids often develop tolerance to this effect in approximately 1 week (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Nagappa et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A comprehensive respiratory assessment constitutes more than counting a patient&#x2019;s respiratory rate (<a href="#bib707">Pasero, 2009</a>). A proper assessment requires watching the rise and fall of the patient&#x2019;s chest to determine rate, depth, and regularity of respirations. Listening to the sound of the patient&#x2019;s respirations is critical as well&#x2014;snoring indicates airway obstruction and must be attended to promptly with repositioning and, depending on severity, a request for respiratory therapy consultation and further evaluation (<a href="#bib707">Pasero, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In most cases (exceptions may apply at the end of life), the opioid antagonist naloxone is promptly given IV to reverse clinically significant opioid-induced respiratory depression (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). The goal is to reverse only the sedation and respiratory depressant effects of the opioid. To this end, it should be diluted and titrated very slowly to prevent severe pain and other adverse effects, which can include hypertension, tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest (APS, 2016) (see <a href="#ct9-6">Chart&#x00A0;9-6</a>, footnote 3, for correct technique). Sometimes more than one dose of naloxone is necessary, because naloxone has a shorter duration of action (1 hour in most patients) than most opioids. In particular, this is true with transdermal fentanyl for which reversal requires repeated doses or an infusion of naloxone to insure appropriate reversal (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Co-Analgesic Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>co-analgesic agents</strong> comprise the largest group of analgesic agents, which offers many options. Medication selection and dosing is based on both experience and evidence-based guideline recommendations. There is considerable variability among individuals in their response to co-analgesic agents, including to agents within the same class; often a &#x201C;trial and error&#x201D; strategy is used in the outpatient setting. Treatment in the outpatient setting often is primarily for patients who have a neuropathic component of pain and involves the use of low initial doses and gradual dose escalation to allow tolerance to the adverse effects. Patients must be forewarned in this setting that the onset of analgesia is likely to require time to achieve analgesic benefit (<a href="#bib633">Pasero, Polomano, Portenoy, et al., 2011</a>). Following is a brief overview of the most commonly used co-analgesic agents.</p>
<p class="h8">Local Anesthetics</p>
<p class="nonindent">Local anesthetics have a long history of safe and effective use for all types of pain management. Local anesthetics are sodium channel blockers that affect the formation and propagation of action potentials. They are given by various routes of administration and are generally well tolerated by most individuals (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>). Injectable and topical local anesthetics are commonly used for procedural pain treatment. Local anesthetics are added to opioid analgesic agents and other agents to be given intraspinally for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. They are also infused for continuous peripheral nerve blocks, primarily after surgery (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The lidocaine patch 5% is placed directly over or adjacent to the painful area for absorption into the tissues directly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page217" title="217"></span>below. This medication produces minimal systemic absorption and adverse effects. The patch is left in place for 12 hours and then removed for as long as 12 hours (12 hours on, 12 hours off regimen). This application process is repeated as needed for continuous analgesia (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). The medication is FDA approved for the neuropathic pain syndrome and postherpetic neuralgia; however, research suggests that it is effective and safe for a variety of other painful neuropathic conditions (APS, 2016). Lidocaine is also available in topical preparations as cream, gel, solution, ointment, and aerosol (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). More recent liposomal formulations of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, which can be instilled in a surgical wound, are reported to have longer duration of action, supporting improved analgesia (<a href="#bib734">Shah, Votta-Velis, &#x0026; Borgeat, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Allergy to local anesthetics is rare. Cardiac and CNS adverse effects are dose related (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). CNS signs of systemic toxicity include ringing in the ears, metallic taste, irritability, and seizures. Signs of cardiotoxicity include circumoral tingling and numbness, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, and CV collapse (<a href="#bib633">Pasero et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Membrane Stabilizer Anticonvulsant Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">The anticonvulsant calcium channel blockers gabapentin and pregabalin are first-line analgesic agents for neuropathic pain (<a href="#bib734">Peterson et al., 2018</a>). They are increasingly being added to postoperative pain treatment plans to address the neuropathic component of surgical pain and can be considered as part of a multimodal approach for postoperative analgesia (<a href="#bib734">Chou et al., 2016</a>). Although further research is needed, their addition has been shown to improve analgesia, allow lower doses of other analgesic agents, and help prevent persistent neuropathic postsurgical pain syndromes, such as phantom limb, post thoracotomy, posthernia, and postmastectomy pain. They may be effective in improving the acute pain associated with burn injuries and as treatment for the neuropathic pain and pruritis following major burn injuries (<a href="#bib674">Griggs, Goverman, Bittner, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib689">Kaul, Amin, Rosenberg, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib723">Wang, Beekman, Hew, et al., 2018</a>). Analgesic anticonvulsant therapy is initiated with low doses and titrated according to patient response. Initial doses of gabapentin may not provide analgesia; titration to effective dosing may take up to 2 months. Pregabalin has a more rapid onset of action with expected maximum effect typically reached in 2 weeks. Primary adverse effects of anticonvulsants are sedation and dizziness, which are usually transient and most notable during the titration phase of treatment (<a href="#bib734">Peterson et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Antidepressant Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">From an analgesic perspective, antidepressant co-analgesic medications are divided into two major groups: the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Evidence-based guidelines recommend the TCAs desipramine and nortriptyline and the SNRIs duloxetine and venlafaxine as first-line options for neuropathic pain treatment (<a href="#bib734">Cruccu &#x0026; Truini, 2017</a>). Their delayed onset of action makes them inappropriate for acute pain treatment. Analgesic antidepressant therapy is initiated with low doses and titrated according to patient response (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib734">Issa, Marshall, &#x0026; Wasan, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Primary adverse effects of TCAs are dry mouth, sedation, dizziness, mental clouding, weight gain, and constipation. Orthostatic hypotension is a potentially serious TCA adverse effect. The most serious adverse effect is cardiotoxicity, and patients with significant heart disease are at high risk. SNRIs are thought to have a more favorable adverse effect profile and to be better tolerated than the TCAs. Due to the side effects, including delirium and confusion, amitriptyline is not indicated for use in older adults (<a href="#bib646">Aguiar, Costa, da Costa, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). The 2015 Beers Criteria<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> identified amitriptyline as potentially inappropriate for prescription among older adults (<a href="#bib669">Fick, Semla, Steinman, et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> for further information on the Beers Criteria). The most common SNRI adverse effects are nausea, headache, sedation, insomnia, weight gain, impaired memory, sweating, and tremors (<a href="#bib734">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Ketamine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic with dose-dependent analgesic, sedative, and amnestic properties (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). As an NMDA antagonist, it blocks the binding of glutamate at the NMDA receptors and thus prevents the transmission of pain to the brain via the ascending pathway (see <a href="c09-sec01.xhtml#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>B, inset). At high doses, this medication can produce psychomimetic effects (e.g., hallucinations, dreamlike feelings); however, these are minimized when low doses are given. A benefit of the medication is that it does not produce respiratory depression. Ketamine is given most often by the IV route but can also be given by the oral, rectal, intranasal, and subcutaneous routes. In addition to intraoperative and procedural use, ketamine has been used for the treatment of persistent neuropathic pain, but its adverse effect profile makes it less favorable than other analgesic agents for long-term therapy. It is, however, increasingly used as a third-line analgesic agent for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;refractory:&lt;/b&gt; nonresponsive or resistant to therapeutic interventions such as analgesic agents">refractory</button></strong> acute pain among patients who are very opioid-tolerant or for patients who are not able to be treated with opioids. It does have a potential for abuse (APS, 2016; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults often live with chronic pain, yet physiologic changes and comorbidities make management more complicated among them (HHS, 2019). Older adults are often sensitive to the effects of co-analgesic agents that produce sedation and other CNS effects, such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Since they are also at risk for undertreatment of pain, therapy should be initiated with low doses, and titration should proceed slowly with systematic assessment of patient response (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults are also at increased risk for NSAID-induced GI toxicity. Acetaminophen should be used for mild pain and is recommended as first line for musculoskeletal pain (e.g., osteoarthritis). If an NSAID is needed for inflammatory pain, it is recommended that a COX-2 selective NSAID (if not contraindicated by an increased CV risk) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page218" title="218"></span>or the nonselective NSAID least likely to cause a peptic ulcer should be used. The addition of a proton pump inhibitor to NSAID therapy, or opioid analgesic agents rather than an NSAID, is recommended for high-risk patients. The American Geriatric Society (AGS) recommends using extreme caution when prescribing NSAIDs among older adults (<a href="#bib686">Jones, Ehrhardt, Ripoll, et al., 2016</a>). NSAIDs are safest when used for short-term pain flares that may occur during transient worsening in severity of chronic diseases or conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain). A number of NSAIDs are available in topical formulations which may be preferred for older adults (<a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib734">Horgas, 2017</a>; HSS, 2019; <a href="#bib734">Sowa, Weiner, &#x0026; Camacho-Soto, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Age is considered an important factor to consider when selecting an opioid dose. The starting opioid dose should be reduced by 25% to 50% in adults older than 70 years because they are more sensitive to opioid adverse effects than younger adults; the number of subsequent doses is based on patient response (<a href="#bib647">American Geriatrics Society [AGS], 2009</a>; <a href="#bib734">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Use of Placebos</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;placebo:&lt;/b&gt; any medication or procedure, including surgery, that produces an effect in a patient because of its implicit or explicit intent and not because of its specific physical or chemical properties">placebo</button></strong> is &#x201C;any sham medication or procedure designed to be void of any known therapeutic value&#x201D; (Lang, Christopher, Emmott, et al., 2018, p. 55). A saline injection is one example of a placebo. Administration of a medication at a known subtherapeutic dose (e.g., 0.10 mg of morphine in an adult) is also considered a placebo.</p>
<p class="indent">Placebos only are appropriately used as controls in research evaluating the effects of a new medication. The new substance or treatment is compared with the effects of a placebo and must show more favorable effects than placebos to warrant further investigation or marketing of the substance or treatment (<a href="#bib734">Enck, Klosterhalfen, &#x0026; Weimer, 2017</a>). When a person responds to a placebo in accordance with its intent, it is called a <em>positive placebo response</em> (<a href="#bib650">Arnstein, Broglio, Wuhrman, et al., 2011</a>). Individuals who participate in placebo-controlled research must be able to give informed consent or have a guardian who can provide informed consent.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Considerations in Selecting and Using Nonpharmacologic Methods</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do the patient, family, and health care team understand the relationship between nonpharmacologic pain management and antispasmodic agents? Patients who have been taking analgesic agents may mistakenly assume that when clinicians suggest a nonpharmacologic method, the purpose is to reduce the use or dose of analgesic agents. All involved must understand that nonpharmacologic methods are used to complement&#x2014;not replace&#x2014;pharmacologic methods.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Does the patient understand the limitations of nonpharmacologic methods? Nonpharmacologic methods are valuable as comfort measures; however, not all such measures relieve pain and should not be promoted as such.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the patient interested in using a nonmedication method, and have any been tried previously? If so, what happened? Is the patient using nonmedication methods because of unfounded fears about analgesic agents? Willingness and interest are important for successful use of nonpharmacologic methods; however, patients may fear taking analgesic agents that clearly are indicated for their pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for an inflammatory painful condition. Such fears should be explored, and accurate information and appropriate treatment provided. Alternately, the reasons a patient refuses to use a nonpharmacologic method also should be explored, but the patient&#x2019;s right to refuse must be respected.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What are the patient&#x2019;s preferences and coping styles? Encouraging patients to choose from a variety of techniques allows them to match the technique to their individual and cultural preferences. If none of the choices appeal to the patient, the patient&#x2019;s right to refuse use should be respected.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Does the patient have the physical and cognitive abilities necessary for using the nonpharmacologic method? Does the patient have sufficient energy to learn and perform any tasks involved? For example, physical and mental fatigue can interfere with the use of distraction and relaxation imagery techniques. Does the patient want to dedicate the necessary time required for the nonpharmacologic method? For example, those who do not find a 20-min self-sustained relaxation technique appealing may be more suited for passive application of cold or heat.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do others (e.g., family, friends) want to be involved in helping the patient? Is the method a potential vehicle for improving relationships between the patient and others? For example, a method that patients cannot do for themselves, such as massage, may be a burden to some caregivers in the home, whereas others may welcome that opportunity to be physically close to a loved one.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are support materials and patient education resources available? Whenever possible, verbal, written, and in some cases, online or video education should be provided.</p>

<p class="indent">Placebos should never be used clinically in a deceitful manner and without informed consent. It is disrespectful and harmful to use them. Pain relief resulting from a placebo is mistakenly believed to invalidate a patient&#x2019;s report of pain. This typically results in the patient being deprived of pain-relief measures, despite research showing that many patients who have obvious physical stimuli for pain (e.g., abdominal surgery) report pain relief after placebo administration. The reason for this is a mystery, but it is one of the many reasons that pain guidelines, position papers, nurse practice acts, and hospital policies nationwide agree that there are no individuals for whom and no condition for which placebos are the recommended treatment. The deceptive use of placebos has both ethical and legal implications, violates the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship, and inevitably deprives patients of appropriate assessment and treatment (<a href="#bib650">Arnstein et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib734">Enck et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib734">Lang et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s184">Nonpharmacologic Methods of Pain Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most individuals use self-management strategies to deal with their health issues and promote well-being. According to national health information, it is estimated that American adults spent $30.2 billion on complementary health practices to treat painful conditions (O&#x2019;Conner-Von, Heck, &#x0026; Peltier, 2018). Nonpharmacologic complementary and alternative interventions include using natural products (e.g., herbs or botanicals, vitamins, probiotics) or using mind and body practices (e.g., acupuncture, behavior-based therapies, chiropractic manipulation, massage therapy, spirituality, yoga, T&#x2019;ai chi) (HHS, 2019). <a href="#tt9-5">Table&#x00A0;9-5</a> lists examples of select complementary and alternative therapies.</p>
<p class="indent">Nonpharmacologic therapies are usually effective alone for mild to some moderate-intensity pain. They should not be a replacement or alternative but complement pharmacologic therapies as part of a multimodal approach for more severe pain. The effectiveness of nonpharmacologic methods can be unpredictable, and although not all will relieve pain, they offer many benefits to patients with pain. For example, research suggests that nonpharmacologic methods can facilitate relaxation and reduce anxiety and stress. Many patients find that the use of nonpharmacologic methods helps them cope better with their pain and feel greater control over the pain experience (HHS, 2019; <a href="#bib631">O&#x2019;Conner-Von et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Several nonpharmacologic methods can be used in the clinical setting to provide comfort and pain relief for all types of pain; however, time is often limited in this setting for implementation of these methods. Nurses play an important role in providing them and educating patients about their use. Many of the methods are relatively easy for nurses to incorporate into daily clinical practice and may be used individually or in combination with other nonpharmacologic therapies to facilitate patient-centered care utilizing a multimodal approach (HHS, 2019; <a href="#bib631">O&#x2019;Conner-Von et al., 2018</a>). <a href="#ct9-7">Chart&#x00A0;9-7</a> provides points for nurses to consider before using nonpharmacologic methods.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s185">Nursing Implications of Pain Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The provision of optimal pain management requires a collaborative approach between patients with pain, their families, and members of the health care team. Everyone involved must share common goals, a common knowledge base, and a common language with regard to the antispasmodic agents and nonpharmacologic methods used to manage pain.

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> An 88-year-old woman arrives in the emergency department following a motor vehicle crash in which she was the restrained front seat passenger. She repeatedly says &#x201C;owie&#x201D; and her daughter reports that this is her mom&#x2019;s way of expressing pain. Her daughter also reports that her mother was recently diagnosed with dementia after family members began noticing increasing forgetfulness and confusion at home. When asked to rate the intensity of her pain, the patient replies &#x201C;owie, yes&#x201D; but she is not able to easily assign a number to her pain. What pain assessment tool would be most helpful in assessing this patient&#x2019;s pain and in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions? What is the strength of the evidence supporting the assessment tool you selected?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> A 62-year-old woman who has chronic abdominal pain following multiple surgeries resulting from an abusive domestic situation is admitted to the medical floor for reports of worsening pain at home. She reports pain and nausea but denies diarrhea or vomiting. In addition to the 50-mcg fentanyl transdermal patch she has used to control pain at home for the last 2 years, the primary provider has prescribed: 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone every 2 hours PRN pain; promethazine 25 mg IV every 4 hours PRN nausea; lorazepam 0.5 mg IV every 6 hours PRN anxiety; and zolpidem 1.75 mg sublingual nightly prior to sleep. The patient asks you to give her all her medications at the same time so that she can sleep. She asserts that &#x201C;the nurses always give me the medication that way when I am in the hospital.&#x201D; You are concerned that all these medications are central nervous system depressants and that given together, they could lead to oversedation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page221" title="221"></span>and possibly result in respiratory depression. How would you prioritize administering the medications that she is requesting and your ongoing assessments to ensure adequate symptom relief while maintaining patient safety and minimizing the risks of adverse outcomes?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> A 28-year-old man is hospitalized with a diagnosis of an epidural abscess. He reports a 5-year history of daily intravenous self-administration of heroin. He tells you that the oxycodone his primary provider prescribed is &#x201C;not doing anything&#x201D; and his pain &#x201C;is 100/10.&#x201D; How will you collaborate with other members of the interprofessional health care team to manage his pain? Using a multimodal approach for analgesia, what other interventions, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, can the team incorporate into his plan of care to better manage his severe pain?</p>
