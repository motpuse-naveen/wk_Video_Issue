<p class="nonindent">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1870">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017</a>). Because of advancements in diagnostic and screening procedures, greater recognition of the importance of diligent self-care practices, and new discoveries in pharmacotherapies, it is now possible for a person diagnosed with heart disease to continue to live with a high quality of life years after being diagnosed. Despite this progress, heart disease remains a chronic and often progressive condition, associated with serious comorbidities, such as heart failure (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1866">Benjamin, Muntner, Alonso, et al., 2019</a>). This chapter presents the complications most often associated with heart disease, including the medical management and nursing processes for managing patients with complications of cardiovascular disease.</p>
