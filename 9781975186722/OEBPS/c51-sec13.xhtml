<h4 class="h4" id="s2368">Uterine Prolapse</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Usually, the uterus and the cervix lie at right angles to the long axis of the vagina with the body of the uterus inclined slightly forward. The uterus is normally freely movable on examination. Individual variations may result in an anterior, middle, or posterior uterine position. A backward positioning of the uterus, known as retroversion and retroflexion, is not uncommon (see <a href="#ff51-5">Fig.&#x00A0;51-5</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">If the structures that support the uterus weaken (typically from childbirth), the uterus may prolapse, or move down the vaginal canal; in severe prolapse, called procidentia, the uterus may appear outside the vaginal orifice (see <a href="#ff51-6">Fig.&#x00A0;51-6</a>). As the uterus descends, it may pull the vaginal walls and even the bladder and rectum with it. Symptoms include pressure and urinary problems (incontinence or retention) from displacement of the bladder. The symptoms are aggravated when a woman coughs, lifts a heavy object, or stands for a long time. Normal activities, even walking up stairs, may aggravate the symptoms.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2369">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are surgical and nonsurgical options for treatment. With surgery, the uterus is sutured back into place and repaired to strengthen and tighten the muscle bands. In women who are postmenopausal, the uterus may be removed by hysterectomy or repaired by colpopexy. Colpocleisis, or vaginal closure, may be an option for women who do not wish to have penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse or to bear children. Conservative treatments and mechanical options, including lifestyle changes, pessaries, and pelvic floor muscle training, can usually result in symptomatic improvement. These options may be the treatment of choice for women with a mild prolapse, who desire additional children, or who are unable to tolerate surgery (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3724">Meriwether, Antosh, Olivera, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2370">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Implementing Preventive Measures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Some disorders related to &#x201C;relaxed&#x201D; pelvic muscles (cystocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse) may be prevented. During pregnancy, early visits to the primary provider permit early detection of problems. During the postpartum period, the woman can be educated to perform pelvic muscle exercises (see <a href="c51-sec12.xhtml#ct51-4">Chart&#x00A0;51-4</a>) to increase muscle mass and strengthen the muscles that support the uterus and then to continue them as a preventive action (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Good &#x0026; Solomon, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Delays in obtaining evaluation and treatment may result in complications such as infection, cervical ulceration, cystitis, and hemorrhoids. The nurse encourages the patient to obtain prompt treatment for these structural disorders.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Implementing Preoperative Nursing Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Before surgery, the patient needs to know the extent of the proposed surgery, the expectations for the postoperative period, and the effect of surgery on future sexual function. In addition, the patient having a rectocele repair needs to know that before surgery, a laxative and a cleansing enema may be prescribed. She may be asked to administer these at home the day before surgery. The patient is usually placed in a lithotomy position for surgery, with special attention given to moving both legs in and out of the stirrups simultaneously to prevent muscle strain and excess pressure on the legs and thighs. Other preoperative interventions are similar to those described in <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Initiating Postoperative Nursing Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate postoperative goals include preventing infection and pressure on any existing suture line. This may require perineal care and may preclude using dressings. The patient is encouraged to void within a few hours after surgery for cystocele and complete tear. If the patient does not void within this period and reports discomfort or pain in the bladder region after 6 hours, catheterization is needed. An indwelling catheter may be indicated for 2 to 4 days, so some women may return home with a catheter in place. Various other bladder care methods are described in <a href="c49.xhtml">Chapter 49</a>. After each voiding or bowel movement, the perineum may be cleaned with warm, sterile saline solution and dried with sterile absorbent material if a perineal incision has been made.</p>
<p class="indent">After an external perineal repair, the perineum is kept as clean as possible. Commercially available sprays containing combined antiseptic and anesthetic solutions are soothing and effective, and an ice pack applied locally may relieve discomfort. However, the weight of the ice bag must rest on the bed, not on the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Routine postoperative care is similar to that given after abdominal surgery. The patient is positioned in bed with the head and knees elevated slightly. The patient may go home the day of or the day after surgery; the length of hospital stay depends on the surgical approach used.</p>
<p class="indent">After surgery for a complete perineal laceration (through the rectal sphincter), special care and attention are required. The bladder is drained through the catheter to prevent strain on the sutures. Throughout recovery, stool-softening agents are given nightly after the patient begins a soft diet.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to discharge, education is provided about cleanliness, prevention of constipation, recommended exercises, and avoiding lifting heavy objects or standing for prolonged periods. The patient is instructed to report any pelvic pain, unusual discharge, inability to carry out personal hygiene, and vaginal bleeding.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is advised to continue with perineal exercises, which are recommended to improve muscle strength and tone. She is reminded to return to the gynecologist for a follow-up visit and to consult with the primary provider about when it is safe to resume sexual activity.</p>
