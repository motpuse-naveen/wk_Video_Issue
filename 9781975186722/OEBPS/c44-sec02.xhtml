<h4 class="h4" id="s1879">The Pancreas</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The pancreas is located in the upper abdomen (see <a href="c44-sec01.xhtml#ff44-1">Fig. 44-1</a>). It has both <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;exocrine:&lt;/b&gt; secreting externally; hormonal secretion from excretory ducts">exocrine</button></strong> (secreting externally; hormonal secretion from excretory ducts) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endocrine:&lt;/b&gt; secreting internally; hormonal secretion of a ductless gland">endocrine</button></strong> (secreting internally; hormonal secretion of a ductless gland) functions. The exocrine functions include secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through the pancreatic duct. The endocrine functions include secretion of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin directly into the bloodstream.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1880">The Exocrine Pancreas</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The secretions of the exocrine portion of the pancreas are collected in the pancreatic duct, which joins the CBD and enters the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater. Surrounding the ampulla is the sphincter of Oddi, which partially controls the rate at which secretions from the pancreas and the gallbladder enter the duodenum.</p>
<p class="indent">The secretions of the exocrine pancreas are digestive enzymes high in protein content and an electrolyte-rich fluid. The secretions, which are very alkaline because of their high concentration of sodium bicarbonate, are capable of neutralizing the highly acidic gastric juice that enters the duodenum. Pancreatic enzymes include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;amylase:&lt;/b&gt; an enzyme that aids in the digestion of starch">amylase</button></strong>, which aids in the digestion of carbohydrates; <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;trypsin:&lt;/b&gt; enzyme that aids in the digestion of protein">trypsin</button></strong>, which aids in the digestion of proteins; and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lipase:&lt;/b&gt; an enzyme that aids in the digestion of fats">lipase</button></strong>, which aids in the digestion of fats. Other enzymes that promote the breakdown of more complex foodstuffs are also secreted.</p>
<p class="indent">Hormones originating in the GI tract stimulate the secretion of these exocrine pancreatic juices. The hormone <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;secretin:&lt;/b&gt; hormone responsible for stimulating bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas; also used as an aid in diagnosing pancreatic exocrine disease">secretin</button></strong> is the major stimulus for increased bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas, and the major stimulus for digestive enzyme secretion is the hormone CCK. The vagus nerve also influences exocrine pancreatic secretion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1881">The Endocrine Pancreas</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The islets of Langerhans, the endocrine part of the pancreas, are collections of cells embedded in the pancreatic tissue. They are composed of alpha, beta, and delta cells. The hormone produced by the beta cells is called <em>insulin,</em> the alpha cells secrete glucagon, and the delta cells secrete somatostatin.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Insulin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A major action of insulin is to lower blood glucose by permitting entry of glucose into the cells of the liver, muscle, and other tissues, where it is either stored as glycogen or used for energy. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat in adipose tissue and the synthesis of proteins in various body tissues. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1418" title="1418"></span>In the absence of insulin, glucose cannot enter the cells and is excreted in the urine. This condition, called <em>diabetes,</em> can be diagnosed by high levels of glucose in the blood. In diabetes, stored fats and protein are used for energy instead of glucose, causing loss of body mass. Diabetes is discussed in detail in <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>. The level of glucose in the blood normally regulates the rate of insulin secretion from the pancreas (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Glucagon</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The effect of glucagon (opposite to that of insulin) is chiefly to raise the blood glucose by converting glycogen to glucose in the liver. Glucagon is secreted by the pancreas in response to a decrease in the level of blood glucose.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Somatostatin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Somatostatin exerts a hypoglycemic effect by interfering with release of growth hormone from the pituitary and glucagon from the pancreas, both of which tend to raise blood glucose levels.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1882">Endocrine Control of Carbohydrate Metabolism</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Glucose required for energy is derived by metabolism of ingested carbohydrates and also from proteins by the process of gluconeogenesis. Glucose can be stored temporarily in the form of glycogen in the liver, muscles, and other tissues. The endocrine system controls the level of blood glucose by regulating the rate at which glucose is synthesized, stored, and moved to and from the bloodstream. Through the action of hormones, blood glucose is normally maintained at less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>). Insulin is the primary hormone that lowers the blood glucose level. Hormones that raise the blood glucose level are glucagon, epinephrine, adrenocorticosteroids, growth hormone, and thyroid hormone.</p>
<p class="indent">The endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas are interrelated. The major exocrine function is to facilitate digestion through secretion of enzymes into the proximal duodenum. Secretin and CCK are hormones from the GI tract that aid in the digestion of food substances by controlling the secretions of the pancreas. Neural factors also influence pancreatic enzyme secretion. Considerable dysfunction of the pancreas must occur before enzyme secretion decreases and protein and fat digestion becomes impaired. Pancreatic enzyme secretion is normally 1500 to 3000 mL/day (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1883"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is little change in the size of the pancreas with age. However, there is an increase in fibrous material and some fatty deposition in the normal pancreas in people older than 70 years. Some localized arteriosclerotic changes occur with age. There is also a decreased rate of pancreatic enzyme secretion (i.e., amylase, lipase, and trypsin) and decreased bicarbonate output in older adults. Some impairment of normal fat absorption occurs with increasing age, possibly because of delayed gastric emptying and pancreatic insufficiency (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>). Decreased calcium absorption may also occur. These changes require care in interpreting diagnostic test results in the normal older patient and in providing dietary counseling.</p>
