<h4 class="h4" id="s3102">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">ALS is a disease of unknown cause in which there is a loss of motor neurons (nerve cells controlling muscles) in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and the motor nuclei of the lower brainstem. It is often referred to as Lou Gehrig disease, after the famous baseball player who suffered from the disease. As motor neuron cells die, the muscle fibers that they supply undergo atrophic changes. Neuronal degeneration may occur in both the upper and lower motor neuron systems (see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>). The leading theory held by researchers is that overexcitation of nerve cells by the neurotransmitter glutamate results in cell injury and neuronal degeneration. Risk factors are noted in <a href="#ct65-5">Chart&#x00A0;65-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">ALS most commonly occurs between 40 and 60 years of age and affects all social, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, with men being affected at slightly higher rates than women. The majority of cases of ALS arise sporadically, but 5% to 10% of cases are familial ALS resulting from an autosomal dominant trait carried by one parent. Familial ALS occurs 10 years earlier than the ALS average, and those afflicted tend to have a shorter life span (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4503">Hardiman, Al-Chalabi, Chio, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3103">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations depend on the location of the affected motor neurons, because specific neurons activate specific muscle fibers. The chief symptoms are fatigue, progressive muscle weakness, cramps, fasciculations (twitching), and lack of coordination. Loss of motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord results in progressive weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the arms, trunk, or legs. Spasticity usually is present, and the deep tendon stretch reflexes become brisk and overactive. Usually, the function of the anal and bladder sphincters remains intact, because the spinal nerves that control muscles of the rectum and urinary bladder are not affected.</p>

<p class="indent">In about 25% of patients, weakness starts in the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, and difficulty in talking, swallowing, and ultimately breathing occurs (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Conde, Martin, &#x0026; Winck, 2019</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Vacca, 2020</a>). When the patient ingests liquids, soft palate and upper esophageal weakness cause the liquid to be regurgitated through the nose. Weakness of the posterior tongue and palate impairs the ability to laugh, cough, or even blow the nose. If bulbar muscles are impaired, speaking and swallowing are progressively difficult, and aspiration becomes a risk. The voice assumes a nasal sound, and articulation becomes so disrupted that speech is unintelligible. Some emotional lability may be present. It was traditionally believed that ALS spared cognitive function, but it is now recognized that some patients experience cognitive impairment.</p>
<p class="indent">The prognosis generally is based on the area of CNS involvement and the speed with which the disease progresses. Eventually, respiratory function is compromised (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Conde et al., 2019</a>). Death usually occurs as a result of infection, respiratory insufficiency, or aspiration.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3104">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">ALS is diagnosed on the basis of the signs and symptoms, because no clinical or laboratory tests are specific to this disease. Electromyography and muscle biopsy studies of the affected muscles indicate reduction in the number of functioning motor units. An MRI scan may show high signal intensity in the corticospinal tracts; this differentiates ALS from a multifocal motor neuropathy. Neuropsychological testing can assist in assessment and diagnosis (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3105">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">No cure exists for ALS (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Vacca, 2020</a>). The main focus of medical and nursing management is on interventions to maintain or improve function, well-being, and quality of life. Because ALS is a progressive disease, the therapeutic needs are different than those of patients with acute processes. Insurance carriers tend to limit the number of therapy sessions, but with early integration into ALS clinics, alliances are developed for future contact with therapists familiar with the disease process (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4506">Hogden, Foley, Henderson, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Two drugs are used to treat ALS, riluzole and edaravone (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Vacca, 2020</a>). The precise action of these drugs is not clear, but both are considered disease modifying treatments for ALS (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Vacca, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Symptomatic treatment and rehabilitative measures are used to support the patient and improve the quality of life. Baclofen, dantrolene sodium, or diazepam may be useful for patients troubled by spasticity, which causes pain and interferes with self-care. Modafinil may be used for fatigue, and additional medications may be added to manage the pain, depression, drooling, and constipation that often accompany the disease. Research suggests that greater functional impairment is associated with greater depressive symptoms; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2132" title="2132"></span>consequently, managing depression helps to maintain a better quality of life (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4530">Soofi, Bello-Haas, Kho, et al., 2018</a>). Many clinical trials and an ALS registry contribute to the ongoing study of this devastating disease (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Vacca, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients with ALS are managed at home and in the community, with hospitalization for acute problems. The most common reasons for hospitalization are dehydration and malnutrition, pneumonia, and respiratory failure; recognizing these problems at an early stage in the illness allows for the development of preventive strategies. End-of-life issues include pain, dyspnea, and delirium (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Mechanical ventilation (using negative-pressure ventilators) is an option if alveolar hypoventilation develops. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation is also an option. The use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation is particularly helpful at night and postpones the decision about whether to undergo a tracheotomy for long-term mechanical ventilation (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Conde et al., 2019</a>). A patient experiencing aspiration and swallowing difficulties may require enteral feeding. A PEG tube is inserted before the forced vital capacity drops below 50% of the predicted value. The tube can be safely placed in patients who are using noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for ventilatory support (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Decisions about life support measures are made by the patient and family and should be based on a thorough understanding of the disease, the prognosis, and the implications of initiating such therapy. Patients are encouraged to complete an advance directive to preserve their autonomy in decision making. See <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for additional discussion of end-of-life care.</p>
