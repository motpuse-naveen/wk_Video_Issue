<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prostatitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the prostate gland">Prostatitis</button></strong> is an inflammation of the prostate gland that is often associated with lower urinary tract symptoms and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1753" title="1753"></span>symptoms of sexual discomfort and dysfunction. The condition affects 5% to 10% of men. It is the most common urologic diagnosis in men younger than 50 years and the third most common such diagnosis in men older than 50 years (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>). Prostatitis may be caused by infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma) or other conditions (e.g., urethral stricture, BPH). <em>Escherichia coli</em> is the most commonly isolated organism, although <em>Klebsiella</em> and <em>Proteus</em> species are also found (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3890">Wu, Jiang, Tan, et al., 2020</a>). The microorganisms colonize the urinary tract and ascend to the prostate, ultimately causing infection. The causal pathogen is usually the same in recurrent infections.</p>
<p class="indent">There are four types of prostatitis: acute bacterial prostatitis (type I), chronic bacterial prostatitis (type II), chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) (type&#x00A0;III), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis (type&#x00A0;IV). Type III, which occurs in more than 90% of cases, is further classified as type IIIA or type IIIB, depending on the presence (type IIIA) or absence (type IIIB) of white blood cells in semen after prostate massage (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Rhoades &#x0026; Bell, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2513">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute prostatitis is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, dysuria, perineal prostatic pain, and severe lower urinary tract symptoms including dysuria, frequency, urgency, hesitancy, and nocturia. Approximately 5% of cases of type I prostatitis (acute bacterial prostatitis) progress to type II prostatitis (chronic bacterial prostatitis) (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>). Patients with type II disease are typically asymptomatic between episodes. Patients with type III prostatitis often have no bacteria in the urine in the presence of genitourinary pain. Patients with type IV prostatitis are usually diagnosed incidentally during a workup for infertility, an elevated PSA test, or other disorders.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2514">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment is to eradicate the causal organisms. Hospital admission may be necessary for patients with unstable vital signs, sepsis, or intractable pelvic pain; those who are frail or immunosuppressed; or those who have diabetes or renal insufficiency. Specific treatment is based on the type of prostatitis and on the results of culture and sensitivity testing of the urine (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3854">Farmer, Johnston, Milica, et al., 2019</a>). If bacteria are cultured from the urine, antibiotic agents, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin), may be prescribed, and continuous therapy with low-dose antibiotic agents may be used. If the patient is afebrile and has a normal urinalysis, anti-inflammatory agents may be used. Alpha-adrenergic blocker therapy (e.g., tamsulosin) may be prescribed to promote bladder and prostate relaxation.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors contributing to prostatitis, including stress, neuromuscular factors, and myofascial pain, are also addressed. Supportive, nonpharmacologic therapies may be prescribed. These include biofeedback, pelvic floor training, physical therapy, reduction of prostatic fluid retention by ejaculation through penile-vaginal intercourse or masturbation, sitz baths, stool softeners, and evaluation of sexual partners to reduce the possibility of cross-infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2515">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient experiences symptoms of acute prostatitis (fever, severe pain and discomfort, inability to urinate, malaise), he may be hospitalized for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Nursing management includes administration of prescribed antibiotic agents and provision of comfort measures, including prescribed analgesic agents and sitz baths.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with chronic prostatitis is usually treated on an outpatient basis and needs to be educated about the importance of continuing antibiotic therapy and recognizing recurrent signs and symptoms of prostatitis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient about the importance of completing the prescribed course of antibiotic therapy. If IV antibiotic agents are to be given at home, the nurse educates the patient and family about correct and safe administration. Arrangements for a home health nurse to oversee administration may be needed. Warm sitz baths (10 to 20 minutes) may be taken several times daily. Fluids are encouraged to satisfy thirst but are not &#x201C;forced,&#x201D; because an effective medication level must be maintained in the urine. Foods and liquids with diuretic action or that increase prostatic secretions, such as alcohol, coffee, tea, chocolate, cola, and spices, should be avoided. A suprapubic catheter may be necessary for severe urinary retention. During periods of acute inflammation, any sexual activity should be avoided. To minimize discomfort, the patient should avoid sitting for long periods. Medical follow-up is necessary for at least 6 months to 1 year, because prostatitis caused by the same or different organisms can recur. The patient is advised that the UTI may recur and is educated to recognize its symptoms.</p>
