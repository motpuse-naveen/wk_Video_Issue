<h4 class="h4" id="s473">Preoperative Nursing Interventions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of interventions are used to prepare the patient physically and psychologically and to maintain safety. Beginning with the nursing history and physical examination, listing of medications taken routinely, history of allergies, and surgical and anesthetic histories, the patient&#x2019;s overall health status and level of experience and understanding may be established.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s474"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Providing Patient Education</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses have long recognized the value of preoperative education (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Each patient&#x2019;s education is individualized, with consideration for any unique concerns or learning needs. Multiple education strategies should be used (e.g., verbal, written, return demonstration), depending on the patient&#x2019;s needs and abilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperative education is initiated as soon as possible, beginning in the physician&#x2019;s office, in the clinic, or at the time of PAT when diagnostic tests are performed. During PAT, the nurse or health care provider makes resources available related to patient education, such as written instructions (designed to be copied and given to patients), audiovisual and online resources, and telephone numbers, to ensure that education continues until the patient arrives for the surgical intervention. When possible, education is spaced over a period of time to allow the patient to assimilate information and ask questions as they arise.</p>
<p class="indent">Frequently, education sessions are combined with various preparation procedures to allow for an easy and timely flow of information. The nurse should guide the patient through the experience and allow ample time for questions. Education should go beyond descriptions of the procedure and should include explanations of the sensations the patient will experience. Telling the patient that a preoperative medication will cause relaxation before the operation is not as effective as also noting that a medication will act quickly and may result in lightheadedness, dizziness, and drowsiness. Knowing what to expect will help the patient anticipate these reactions and attain a superior degree of relaxation. Overly detailed descriptions may increase anxiety in some patients; therefore, the nurse should be sensitive to this, by watching and listening, and provide less detail based on the individual patient&#x2019;s needs.</p>

<p class="nonindent">One goal of preoperative nursing care is to educate the patient how to promote optimal lung expansion and resulting blood oxygenation after anesthesia. The patient assumes a sitting position to enhance lung expansion. The nurse then demonstrates how to take a deep, slow breath and how to exhale slowly. After practicing deep breathing several times, the patient is instructed to breathe deeply, exhale through the mouth, take a short breath, and cough deeply in the lungs (see <a href="#ct14-5">Chart&#x00A0;14-5</a>). The nurse or respiratory therapist also demonstrates how to use an incentive spirometer, a device that provides measurement and feedback related to breathing effectiveness (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). In addition to enhancing respiration, these exercises may help the patient relax.</p>
<p class="indent">If a thoracic or abdominal incision is anticipated, the nurse demonstrates how to splint the incision to minimize pressure and control pain. The patient should put the palms of both hands together, interlacing the fingers snugly. Splinting or placing the hands across the incision site acts as an effective support when coughing. The patient is informed that medications are available to relieve pain and should be taken regularly for pain relief so that effective deep-breathing and coughing exercises can be performed comfortably. The goal in promoting coughing is to mobilize secretions so that they can be removed. Deep breathing before coughing stimulates the cough reflex. If the patient does not cough effectively, atelectasis (collapse of the alveoli), pneumonia, or other lung complications may occur.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mobility and Active Body Movement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of promoting mobility postoperatively are to improve circulation, prevent venous stasis, and promote optimal respiratory function. The patient should be taught that early and frequent ambulation postoperatively, as tolerated, will help prevent complications.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse explains the rationale for frequent position changes after surgery and then shows the patient how to turn from side to side and how to assume the lateral position without causing pain or disrupting IV lines, drainage tubes, or other equipment. Any special position the patient needs to maintain after surgery (e.g., adduction or elevation of an extremity) is discussed, as is the importance of maintaining as much mobility as possible despite restrictions. Reviewing the process before surgery is helpful, because the patient may be too uncomfortable or drowsy after surgery to absorb new information.</p>
<p class="indent">Exercise of the extremities includes extension and flexion of the knee and hip joints (similar to bicycle riding while lying on the side) unless contraindicated by type of surgical procedure (e.g., hip replacement). The great toe is pointed and rotated as though tracing a large circle (see <a href="#ct14-5">Chart&#x00A0;14-5</a>). The elbow and shoulder are also put through their range of motion. At first, the patient is assisted and reminded to perform these exercises. Later, the patient is encouraged to do them independently. Muscle tone is maintained so that ambulation will be easier. The nurse should remember to use proper body mechanics and to instruct the patient to do the same. Whenever the patient is positioned, their body needs to be properly aligned.</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Diaphragmatic Breathing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Diaphragmatic breathing refers to a flattening of the dome of the diaphragm during inspiration, with resultant enlargement of the upper abdomen as air rushes in. During expiration, the abdominal muscles contract.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pain Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A pain assessment should include differentiation between acute and chronic pain. A pain intensity scale should be introduced and explained to the patient to promote more effective postoperative pain management. (See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for examples of pain scales.) Preoperative patient education also needs to include the difference between acute and chronic pain so that the patient is prepared to differentiate acute postoperative pain from a chronic condition such as back pain. Preoperative pain assessment and education for the older patient may require additional attention (see <a href="#ct14-6">Chart&#x00A0;14-6</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Postoperatively, medications are given to relieve pain and maintain comfort without suppressing respiratory function. The patient is instructed to take the medication as frequently as prescribed during the initial postoperative period for pain relief. Anticipated methods of administration of analgesic agents for inpatients include patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), epidural catheter bolus or infusion, or patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA; see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for discussion of PCA and PCEA). A patient who is expected to go home will likely receive oral analgesic agents. These methods are discussed with the patient before surgery, and the patient&#x2019;s interest and willingness to use them are assessed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cognitive Coping Strategies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although some anxiety is common in the surgical setting, untreated or undertreated high preoperative anxiety can lead to complications. Tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, and increased levels of pain have been reported postoperatively in patients with increased preoperative anxiety (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1241">Jaruzel, Gregoski, Mueller, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Cognitive strategies may be useful for relieving tension, overcoming anxiety, decreasing fear, and achieving relaxation. Examples of general strategies include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Guided Imagery:</em> The patient concentrates on a pleasant experience or restful scene.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Distraction:</em> The patient thinks of an enjoyable story or recites a favorite poem or song.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Optimistic Self-Recitation:</em> The patient recites optimistic thoughts (&#x201C;I know all will go well&#x201D;).</span></li>
<li><span><em>Music Therapy:</em> The patient listens to soothing music (an easy-to-administer, inexpensive, noninvasive intervention).</span></li>
<li><span><em>Aromatherapy:</em> The patient inhales aromatic oils to trigger emotional and physical relaxation responses through the olfactory system and brain.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Reiki:</em> The practitioner places hands over the patient to (theoretically) transfer energy to promote healing and relaxation.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Alternative interventions may include acupuncture, yoga therapy, muscle relaxation, and therapeutic touch.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Education for Patients Undergoing Ambulatory Surgery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative education for the same-day or ambulatory surgical patient comprises all previously discussed patient education as well as collaborative planning with the patient and family for discharge and follow-up home care. The major difference in outpatient preoperative education is the environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperative education content may be presented in a group class, in a media presentation, at PAT, or by telephone in conjunction with the preoperative interview. In addition to answering questions and describing what to expect, the nurse tells the patient when and where to report, what to bring (insurance card, list of medications and allergies), what to leave at home (jewelry, watch, medications, contact lenses), and what to wear (loose-fitting, comfortable clothes; flat shoes). The nurse in the surgeon&#x2019;s office may initiate education before the perioperative telephone contact.</p>
<p class="indent">During the final preoperative telephone call, education is completed or reinforced as needed and last-minute instructions are given. The patient is reminded not to eat or drink for a specified period of time and about skin cleansing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page411" title="411"></span>techniques prior to surgery (see later section on preparing the skin).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s475">Providing Psychosocial Interventions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses for and provides interventions to enhance coping mechanisms to deal effectively with anxiety and fears, and thus provide emotional comfort (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Phillips, 2017</a>). Preoperatively, the nurse assesses any patient specific needs that may affect the emotional, psychosocial, or physical surgical experience.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Anxiety and Decreasing Fear</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Perioperative nurses in the preoperative department have a limited amount of time to acquire information and establish trust. Nurses must introduce themselves, giving their title and a brief synopsis of their professional role and background. Each preoperative patient should be acknowledged as an individual, and each patient&#x2019;s needs and desires must be assessed. The patient should be thanked for choosing that particular hospital or surgical center. These methods facilitate establishing a positive nurse&#x2013;patient relationship. Discussion of the surgical experience, its length, and explanation of what will happen may diminish the patient&#x2019;s anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">During the preoperative assessment of psychological factors and spiritual and cultural beliefs, the nurse assists the patient to identify coping strategies that he or she has previously used to decrease fear. Discussions with the patient to help determine the source of fears can help with expression of concerns. The patient benefits from knowing when family and friends will be able to visit after surgery and that a spiritual advisor will be available if desired. Knowing ahead of time about the possible need for a ventilator, drainage tubes, or other types of equipment helps decrease anxiety related to the postoperative period. Careful attention should be placed on patients who experience a delay in surgery as prolonged wait times in the preoperative area can lead to increased fear and anxiety.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Respecting Cultural, Spiritual, and Religious Beliefs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses for any patient specific needs that may affect the spiritual, emotional, or physical surgical experience. In some cultures, for example, people are stoic in regard to pain, whereas in others they are more expressive. These responses should be recognized as normal for those patients and families and should be respected by perioperative personnel. If patients decline blood transfusions for religious reasons (Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses), this information needs to be clearly identified in the preoperative period, documented, and communicated to the appropriate personnel. Although minimally invasive surgery has significantly lowered blood loss, any surgical procedure has the potential for hemorrhage.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s476">Maintaining Patient Safety</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Protecting patients from injury is one of the major roles of the perioperative nurse. Adherence to AORN-recommended practices and The Joint Commission&#x2019;s National Patient Safety Goals (see <a href="#ct14-7">Chart&#x00A0;14-7</a>) are crucial (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). These apply to hospitals as well as to ambulatory surgery centers and office-based surgery facilities (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1242">Joint Commission, 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s477">Managing Nutrition and Fluids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The purpose of withholding food and fluid before surgery is to prevent aspiration. Specific recommendations for restrictions depend on the age of the patient and the type of food eaten. For example, adults may be advised to fast for 8 hours after eating fatty food and 6 hours after ingesting milk products. Healthy patients are allowed clear liquids up to 2 hours before an elective procedure. New methods of &#x201C;carbohydrate loading&#x201D; have been implemented preoperatively in surgeries that do not involve the gastrointestinal system (i.e., thoracic, urologic, obstetric, orthopedic). A carbohydrate-rich drink has been used as a safe fasting process before surgery. It has been reported that these solutions do not pose a risk for aspiration and decrease insulin resistance when the duration of gastric emptying and the amount of liquid intake are controlled (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1234">Cakar, Yilmaz, Cakar, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Preoperative carbohydrate loading in patients undergoing surgery as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol has demonstrated positive outcomes including decreased LOS, decreased incidence of PONV, and decreased pain (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1247">Pachella, Mehran, Curtin, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s478">Preparing the Bowel</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Enemas are not commonly prescribed preoperatively unless the patient is undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery. In this case, a cleansing enema or laxative may be prescribed the evening before surgery and may be repeated the morning of surgery. The goals of this preparation are to allow satisfactory visualization of the surgical site and to prevent trauma to the intestine or contamination of the peritoneum by fecal material. Unless the condition of the patient presents some contraindication, the toilet or bedside commode, rather than the bedpan, is used for evacuating the enema if the patient is hospitalized during this time. In addition, antibiotics may be prescribed to reduce intestinal flora.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s479">Preparing the Skin</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of preoperative skin preparation is to decrease bacteria without injuring the skin. If the surgery is not performed as an emergency, most health care facilities and ambulatory surgical centers have implemented preoperative antiseptic skin cleansing protocols. At a minimum, preoperative bathing should consist of a full-body wash using antimicrobial soap the night before the planned surgery (Berr&#x00ED;os-Torres, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page412" title="412"></span>Umscheid, Bratzler, et&#x00A0;al., 2018). Additional body cleansing with chlorhexidine wipes may occur in the preoperative area via the nurse or by the patient under the direction of the nurse. Surgical site hair removal should occur in the preoperative area. Electric clippers, not skin razors, are the preferred method for hair removal. Special consideration is given to those undergoing gynecologic, urologic, and cranial surgeries. To ensure the correct site, the surgical site is typically marked by the patient and the surgeon prior to the procedure.</p>
