<p class="nonindent">Hypothyroidism results from suboptimal levels of thyroid hormone. Thyroid deficiency can affect all body functions and can range from mild, subclinical forms to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myxedema:&lt;/b&gt; severe hypothyroidism; can be with or without coma">myxedema</button></strong> (severe deficiency discussed later), an advanced life-threatening form. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in adults is autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease), in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism may later be followed by those of hypothyroidism and myxedema. Hypothyroidism also commonly occurs in patients with previous hyperthyroidism that has been treated with radioiodine or antithyroid medications or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thyroidectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland">thyroidectomy</button></strong> (surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland). Testing of thyroid function is recommended for all patients who receive radiation therapy to the neck. See Chart&#x00A0;45-3 for other causes of hypothyroidism.</p>
<p class="indent">More than 95% of patients with hypothyroidism have primary or thyroidal hypothyroidism, which refers to dysfunction of the thyroid gland itself. If the cause of the thyroid dysfunction is failure of the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, or both, the hypothyroidism is known <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1456" title="1456"></span>as central hypothyroidism. If the cause is entirely a pituitary disorder, it may be referred to as pituitary or secondary hypothyroidism. If the cause is a disorder of the hypothalamus resulting in inadequate secretion of TSH due to decreased stimulation of TRH, it is referred to as hypothalamic or tertiary hypothyroidism. If thyroid deficiency is present at birth, it is referred to as neonatal hypothyroidism. In such instances, the mother may also have thyroid deficiency. The term <em>myxedema</em> refers to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in subcutaneous and other interstitial tissues. Although myxedema occurs in long-standing hypothyroidism, the term is used appropriately only to describe the extreme symptoms of severe hypothyroidism (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3414">Chaker, Bianco, Janklaas, et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1961">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Presenting clinical manifestations in adults frequently reflect the decrease in metabolism resulting from the decrease in thyroid function. Clinical manifestations include complaints of fatigue and lethargy that may interfere with activities of daily living, weight gain without an increased intake of calories, cold intolerance, dry skin, and, in some patients, a deepening of the voice. Other clinical manifestations are related to gender, age, and duration of the decrease in thyroid function (see <a href="#ff45-5">Fig. 45-5</a>). These include cardiovascular-related manifestations such as bradycardia and changes in electrical conduction of the heart which will be noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG). In women, changes in the menstrual cycle will be noted (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Chaker et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Severe hypothyroidism results in a subnormal body temperature and pulse rate. The patient usually begins to gain weight even without an increase in food intake, although they may be cachectic. The skin becomes thickened because of an accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the subcutaneous tissues. The hair thins and falls out, and the face becomes expressionless and masklike. The patient often complains of being cold even in a warm environment.</p>
<p class="indent">At first, the patient may be irritable and may complain of fatigue, but as the condition progresses, the emotional responses are subdued. The mental processes become dulled, and the patient appears apathetic. Speech is slow, the tongue enlarges, the hands and feet increase in size, and deafness may occur. The patient frequently reports constipation.</p>
<p class="indent">Advanced hypothyroidism may produce personality and cognitive changes characteristic of dementia. Inadequate ventilation and sleep apnea can occur with severe hypothyroidism. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and respiratory muscle weakness may also occur (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Chaker et al., 2017</a>).</p>

Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Severe hypothyroidism is associated with an elevated serum cholesterol level, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and poor left ventricular function. The patient with advanced hypothyroidism is hypothermic and abnormally sensitive to sedative, opioid, and anesthetic agents, which must be given with extreme caution.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with unrecognized hypothyroidism who are undergoing surgery are at increased risk for intraoperative hypotension, postoperative heart failure, and altered mental status.</p>
<p class="indent">Myxedema coma is a rare life-threatening condition and a decompensated state of severe hypothyroidism in which the patient is hypothermic and unconscious. This condition may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1457" title="1457"></span>develop with undiagnosed hypothyroidism and may be precipitated by infection or other systemic disease or by use of sedatives or opioid analgesic agents. Patients may also experience myxedema coma if they forget to take their thyroid replacement medication. The condition occurs most often among older women in the winter months and appears to be precipitated by cold. However, the disorder can affect any age group.</p>
<p class="indent">In myxedema coma, the patient may initially show signs of depression, diminished cognitive status, lethargy, and somnolence (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Chaker et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Increasing lethargy may progress to stupor. The patient&#x2019;s respiratory drive is depressed, resulting in alveolar hypoventilation, progressive carbon dioxide retention, narcosis, and coma. In addition, patients with myxedema coma can also exhibit hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypoventilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia. These symptoms, along with cardiovascular collapse and shock, require aggressive and intensive supportive and hemodynamic therapy if the patient is to survive. Although there has been a decline in mortality rates over the past two decades due to early intervention and improved therapies, the mortality rate remains at 40% despite treatment; proper diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Eledrisi, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1962">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives in the management of hypothyroidism are to restore a normal metabolic state by replacing the missing hormone, as well as prevention of disease progression and complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Synthetic levothyroxine is the drug of choice for the treatment of hypothyroidism (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Drake, 2018</a>). The general range is 75 to 150 mcg per day and treatment is generally started at the lower dose and titrated slowly until desired levels of serum TSH concentration are achieved (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). Older adult patients generally require a lower dose; normal TSH levels are often achieved with 50 mcg per day (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). Some patients on thyroid hormone replacement may complain of continued clinical manifestations despite normal TSH levels (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Chaker et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Prevention of Cardiac Dysfunction</p>
<p class="nonindent">Any patient who has had hypothyroidism for a long period usually has associated elevated serum cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. As long as metabolism is subnormal and the tissues (including the myocardium) require relatively little oxygen, a reduction in blood supply is tolerated without overt symptoms of coronary artery disease. When thyroid hormone is given, the oxygen demand increases, but oxygen delivery cannot be increased unless, or until, the atherosclerosis improves. This occurs very slowly, if at all. The occurrence of angina and acute coronary syndrome (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>) is the signal that the oxygen needs of the myocardium exceed its blood supply. Angina or arrhythmias can occur when thyroid replacement is initiated because thyroid hormones enhance the cardiovascular effects of catecholamines.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse must monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction, which can occur in response to therapy in patients with severe, long-standing hypothyroidism or myxedema coma, especially during the early phase of treatment. Acute coronary syndrome must be aggressively treated to avoid morbid complications (e.g., myocardial infarction).</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">If angina or arrhythmias occur, thyroid hormone administration must be discontinued immediately. Later, when it can be resumed safely, it should be prescribed cautiously at a lower dosage and with close monitoring by the primary provider and the nurse.</p>
<p class="h7">Prevention of Medication Interactions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oral thyroid hormones interact with many other medications. They increase the effect of warfarin and the cardiovascular effects of adrenergic agents (bronchodilators and vasopressors). In addition, the dosage of insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications used to treat diabetes may require adjustment. Caution is also needed in patients who are concomitantly taking estrogen, which may necessitate an increased dosage of the oral thyroid hormone. Absorption may be affected by any supplement or food that contains calcium, iron, magnesium or zinc (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Even in small IV doses, hypnotic and sedative agents may induce profound somnolence, lasting far longer than anticipated and leading to narcosis (stuporlike condition). Furthermore, they are likely to cause respiratory depression, which can easily be fatal because of decreased respiratory reserve and alveolar hypoventilation. The dose of these medications should be one half or one third of that typically prescribed for patients of similar age and weight with normal thyroid function.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Supportive Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma require prompt, aggressive management to maintain vital functions. Arterial blood gases may be measured to determine carbon dioxide retention and to guide the use of assisted ventilation to combat hypoventilation. Oxygen saturation levels should be monitored using pulse oximetry. Fluids are given cautiously because of the danger of water intoxication. Passive rewarming with a blanket is recommended versus active rewarming such as application of external heat (e.g., heating pads). The latter should be avoided to prevent increased oxygen demands and hypotension.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1963">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of the patient with hypothyroidism and myxedema is summarized in the plan of nursing care in Chart&#x00A0;45-4. In patients with hypothyroidism, the effects of analgesic, sedative, and anesthetic agents are prolonged. The nurse should carefully monitor patients who are prescribed these agents for adverse effects. Older patients are at increased risk because of age-related changes in liver and renal function.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1458" title="1458"></span></p>

<p class="nonindent">The prevalence of hypothyroidism increases with age, most often among women (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3413">Calsolaro, Niccolai, Pasqualetti, et al., 2019</a>). The higher prevalence of hypothyroidism among older adults may be related to age-related alterations in immune function and complicated by multiple comorbidities.</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients with primary hypothyroidism present with long-standing mild to moderate hypothyroidism. Subclinical disease is common among older women and can be asymptomatic or mistaken for other medical conditions. Subtle symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, muscle aches, and mental confusion, may be attributed to the normal aging process by patients, families, and health care providers; therefore, these symptoms require close attention (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Calsolaro et al., 2019</a>). In addition, signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism in older adults are often atypical, and manifestations of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism may blur. Patients may have few or no symptoms until dysfunction is severe. Depression, apathy, and decreased mobility or activity may be the major initial symptoms and may be accompanied by significant weight loss. Constipation affects one fourth of older patients.</p>
<p class="indent">In those with mild to moderate hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement is individually tailored and must be started with low dosages and increased gradually to prevent serious cardiovascular side effects (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Calsolaro et al., 2019</a>). Angina, for example, may occur with rapid thyroid replacement in the presence of coronary artery disease secondary to the hypothyroid state. Heart failure and tachyarrhythmias may worsen during the transition from the hypothyroid state to the normal metabolic state. Dementia may become more apparent during early thyroid hormone replacement in older patients with concomitant dementia.</p>
<p class="indent">Older patients with severe hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis may become confused and agitated if their metabolic rate is increased too quickly. Marked clinical improvement follows the administration of hormone replacement; such medication must be continued for life, even though signs of hypothyroidism disappear within 3 to 12 weeks.</p>
<p class="indent">Older patients require periodic follow-up monitoring of serum TSH levels, because poor adherence with therapy may occur or the patient may take the medications erratically. A careful history can identify the need for further education about the importance of the medication.</p>
