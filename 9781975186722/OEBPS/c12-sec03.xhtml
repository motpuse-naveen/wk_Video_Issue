<h4 class="h4" id="s375">Detection and Prevention of Cancer</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses in all settings play a key role in cancer detection and prevention. Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of cancer are all important.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s376">Primary Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary prevention is about reducing the risks of disease through health promotion and risk reduction strategies. Guidelines on nutrition and physical activity for cancer prevention can be found in <a href="#ct12-2">Chart&#x00A0;12-2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">An example of primary prevention is the use of immunization to reduce the risk of cancer through prevention of infections associated with cancer. The HPV vaccine is recommended to prevent cervical and head and neck cancers (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib981">Hashim, Genden, Posner, et al., 2019</a>). The vaccine to prevent HBV infection is recommended by the CDC (2018) to reduce the risk of hepatitis and subsequent development of liver cancer.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s377">Secondary Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Secondary prevention involves screening and early detection activities that seek to identify precancerous lesions and early-stage cancer in individuals who lack signs and symptoms of cancer. ACS screening is advocated for many types of cancer (see <a href="c12-sec04.xhtml#tt12-3">Table&#x00A0;12-3</a>) (ACS, 2018). Detection of cancer at an early stage may reduce costs, use of resources, and the morbidity associated with advanced stages of cancer and their associated complex treatment approaches. Many screening and detection programs target people who do not regularly practice health-promoting behaviors or lack access to health care. Nurses continue to develop community-based screening and detection programs that address barriers to health care or reflect the socioeconomic and cultural beliefs of the target population (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1034">Rees, Jones, Jones, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1043">So, Kwong, Chen, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The evolving understanding of the role of genetics in cancer cell development has contributed to prevention and screening efforts. Many centers offer cancer risk evaluation programs that provide interdisciplinary in-depth assessment, screening, education, and counseling as well as follow-up monitoring for people at high risk for cancer (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] 2019a,b). The NCI provides guidance for cancer risk assessment, counseling, education, and genetic testing (NCI, 2019b).</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Achieve and Maintain a Healthy Weight Throughout Life</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be as lean as possible throughout life without being underweight.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid excessive weight gain at all ages. For those who are currently overweight or have obesity, losing even a small amount of weight has health benefits and is a good place to start.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Engage in regular physical activity and limit consumption of high-calorie foods and beverages as key strategies for maintaining a healthy weight.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Adopt a Physically Active Lifestyle</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week, or an equivalent combination, preferably spread throughout the week.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Children and adolescents should engage in at least 1 hour of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity each day, with vigorous-intensity activity at least 3 days each week.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Limit sedentary behavior such as sitting, lying down and watching television, and other forms of screen-based entertainment.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Doing any intentional physical activity above usual activities, no matter what one&#x2019;s level of activity, can have many health benefits.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Consume a Healthy Diet, with an Emphasis on Plant Sources</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Choose foods and beverages in amounts that help achieve and maintain a healthy weight.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Limit consumption of processed meat and red meats.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eat at least 2&#x00BD; cups of vegetables and fruits each day.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Choose whole grains in preference to processed (refined) grains.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">If You Drink Alcoholic Beverages, Limit Consumption</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Drink no more than one drink per day for women or two per day for men.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Community Action</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Public, private, and community organizations should work collaboratively at national, state, and local levels to implement policy environmental changes that:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Increase access to affordable, healthy foods in communities, worksites, and schools, and decrease access to and marketing of foods and beverages of low nutritional value, particularly to youth.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Provide safe, enjoyable, and accessible environments for physical activity in schools and worksites, and for transportation and recreation in communities.</p>

<p class="box5text"><span class="unfold"><strong>Doris Bowman</strong></span>, a 39-year-old diagnosed with uterine fibroids, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia, is scheduled for a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoopherectomy. She has a family history of uterine and ovarian cancer. She asks the nurse what she can do to further reduce her risk for cancer and is also concerned for her family members. What patient and family education should the nurse present on risk reduction strategies, health promotion, and cancer screening? (Doris Bowman&#x2019;s story continues in <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a>.)</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s378">Tertiary Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Improved screening, diagnosis, and treatment approaches have led to an estimated 16.9 million cancer survivors in the United States (ACS, 2019f). Tertiary prevention efforts focus on monitoring for and preventing recurrence of the primary cancer as well as screening for the development of second malignancies in cancer survivors. Survivors are assessed for the development of second malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia, which have been associated with certain chemotherapy agents and the use of radiation therapy (ACS, 2019f). Survivors may also develop second malignancies not related to treatment, but rather genetic mutations related to inherited cancer syndromes, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors.</p>
