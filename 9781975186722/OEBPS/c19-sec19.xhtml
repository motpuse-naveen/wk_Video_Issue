<p class="nonindent">Many American veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are experiencing respiratory disorders as a result of exposure to pollutants in situations such as sand storms and car bombings. Their illnesses can range from a new onset of asthma to constrictive bronchiolitis (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1493">Harrington, Schmidt, Szema, et al., 2017</a>). These veterans could also have been exposed to organic contamination within the sand that could further irritate airways. When providing care to a veteran, it is important to assess exposure to airway irritants, particularly when the patient is complaining of chronic respiratory symptoms.</p>
