<h4 class="h4" id="s2536">Testicular Torsion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency requiring immediate diagnosis to avoid loss of the testicle. Torsion of the testis is rotation of the testis, which twists the blood vessels in the spermatic cord and therefore impedes the arterial and venous supply to the testicle and surrounding structures in the scrotum. The patient presents with sudden pain in the testicle, developing over 1 to 2 hours, with or without a predisposing event. Nausea, lightheadedness, and swelling <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1771" title="1771"></span>of the scrotum may develop. On physical examination, testicular tenderness, an elevated testis, a thickened spermatic cord, and a swollen, painful scrotum may be present. If the torsion cannot be reduced manually, surgery to untwist the spermatic cord and anchor both testes in their correct position to prevent recurrence should occur within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms in order to save the testis (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Norris, 2019</a>). After 6 hours of impaired blood supply, the risk of loss of the testicle increases.</p>
