<h4 class="h4a" id="s3212">TRAUMA</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Trauma (an unintentional or intentional wound or injury inflicted on the body from a mechanism against which the body cannot protect itself) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Trauma is the leading cause of death in children and in adults younger than 44 years. The incidence is increasing in adults older than 44 years. SUD is often implicated as a factor in both blunt and penetrating trauma (ENA, 2020a).</p>
