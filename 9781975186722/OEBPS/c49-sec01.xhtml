<p class="nonindent">Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by pathogenic microorganisms in the urinary tract (the normal urinary tract is sterile above the urethra). UTIs are generally classified by location as infections of the lower urinary tract, involving the bladder and structures below the bladder, or upper urinary tract, involving the kidneys and ureters.</p>
<p class="indent">A UTI is the second most common infection in the body. UTIs account for nearly 25% of all infections and are commonly diagnosed in women visiting emergency departments in the United States. Approximately 8.1 million women are diagnosed with UTIs in the United States annually (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman, Martin, &#x0026; Uithoven, 2017</a>). In addition, UTIs are the cause of more than 100,000 hospital admissions annually (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Fifty percent of all hospital-acquired infections are UTIs, and in the majority of cases these are <strong>catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)</strong> (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman et al., 2017</a>). A CAUTI is a UTI associated with indwelling urinary catheters. The definition used for ongoing monitoring is a UTI that occurs while the patient had an indwelling urinary catheter in place for more than 2 calendar days on the day that the infection was detected.</p>
