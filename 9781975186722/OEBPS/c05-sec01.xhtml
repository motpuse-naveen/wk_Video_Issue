<h4 class="h4" id="s69">Fundamental Concepts</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Each body system performs specific functions to sustain optimal life for an organism. Compensatory mechanisms for adjusting internal conditions promote the steady state of the organism, ensure its survival, and restore balance in the body. Pathophysiologic processes result when cellular injury occurs at such a rapid rate that the body&#x2019;s compensatory mechanisms cannot make the adaptive changes necessary to remain healthy.</p>
<p class="indent">Physiologic mechanisms must be understood in the context of the body as a whole. Each person has both an internal and external environment, between which information and matter are continuously exchanged. Within the internal environment, each organ, tissue, and cell is also a system or subsystem of the whole, each with its own internal and external environment, each exchanging information and matter (<a href="#ff5-1">Fig.&#x00A0;5-1</a>). The goal of the interaction of the body&#x2019;s subsystems is to produce a dynamic balance or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;steady state:&lt;/b&gt; a stable condition that does not change over time, or when change in one direction is balanced by change in an opposite direction">steady state</button></strong> (even in the presence of change) so that all subsystems are in harmony with each other. Four concepts&#x2014;constancy, homeostasis, stress, and adaptation&#x2014;are key to the understanding of steady state.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s70">Constancy and Homeostasis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Claude Bernard, a 19th-century French physiologist, first developed the biologic principle that for life there must be a constancy or &#x201C;fixity of the internal milieu&#x201D; despite changes in the external environment. The internal milieu is the fluid that bathed the cells, and the constancy the balanced internal state maintained by physiologic and biochemical processes. His principle implies a static process.</p>
<p class="indent">Bernard&#x2019;s principle of &#x201C;constancy&#x201D; underpins the concept of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;homeostasis:&lt;/b&gt; a steady state within the body; the stability of the internal environment">homeostasis</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, which refers to a steady state within the body. When a change or stress occurs that causes a body function to deviate from its stable range, processes are initiated to restore and maintain dynamic balance. An example of this restorative effort is the development of hyperpnea (rapid breathing) after intense exercise in an attempt to compensate for an oxygen deficit and excess lactic acid accumulated in the muscle tissue. When these adjustment processes or compensatory mechanisms are not adequate, steady state is threatened, function becomes disordered, and dysfunctional responses occur. For example, in heart failure, the body reacts by retaining sodium and water and increasing venous pressure, which worsens the condition. Dysfunctional responses can lead to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;disease:&lt;/b&gt; an abnormal variation in the structure or function of any part of the body">disease</button></strong> (an abnormal variation in the structure or function of any part of the body), which is a threat to steady state.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s71">Stress and Adaptation</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stress management:&lt;/b&gt; behaviors and techniques used to strengthen a person&#x2019;s resources against stress">Stress</button></strong> is a disruptive condition produced by a change in the environment that is perceived as challenging, threatening, or damaging to a person&#x2019;s dynamic balance or equilibrium. The person may feel unable to meet the demands of the new situation. The change or stimulus that evokes this state is the stressor. A person appraises and copes with changing situations. The desired goal is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adaptation:&lt;/b&gt; a change or alteration designed to assist in adjusting to a new situation or environment">adaptation</button></strong> or adjustment to the change so that the person is again in equilibrium and has the energy and ability to meet new demands. This is the process of coping with the stress, a compensatory process that uses cognitive and behavioral strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">Because both stress and adaptation may exist at different levels of a system, it is possible to study these reactions at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Biologists are concerned mainly with subcellular components or with subsystems of the total body. Behavioral scientists, including many nurse researchers, study stress and adaptation in individuals, families, groups, and societies; they focus on how a group&#x2019;s organizational features are modified to meet the requirements of the social and physical environment in which the group exists. In any system, the desired goals of adaptation are survival, growth, and reproduction.</p>
