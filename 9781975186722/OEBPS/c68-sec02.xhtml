<h4 class="h4" id="s3275">Federal, State, and Local Responses to Disasters</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Many resources are available at the federal, state, and local levels to assist in the management of disasters, mass casualty incidents, public health crises, and emergencies. A <strong>mass casualty incident (MCI)</strong> is defined as any incident that causes a large number of casualties to the extent that necessary resources become too scarce (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). When resources to care for casualties become scarce, the greatest good for the greatest number of patients becomes the mode of operation. Local communities must be prepared to act in isolation (i.e., called <em>sustainability planning</em>) and provide competent care for up to 5 days before federal or other state resources may become available (FEMA, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Disasters are categorized by type based upon anticipated use of resources and incident duration. A list of local resources with specific instructions about how and when to contact these agencies or organizations should be readily available to local disaster planning committees and frequently reviewed by those committees for necessary updates.</p>
<p class="indent">A disaster response strategy cannot succeed without appropriate physical assets and staff trained and prepared to carry out the plan. Assets such as increased security; stockpiles of equipment and medications; and planning, drills, and training are essential (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). Hazard vulnerability assessments should be performed to identify potential and actual threats that involve a particular facility or community. Mutual aid agreements among various communities must take these vulnerabilities into account. Successful execution of a response plan is based on knowledge, confidence, and readiness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3276">Federal Agencies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The National Health Security Strategy was designed to protect the health of all citizens of the United States in the event of any large-scale MCI or disaster (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). This national strategy aims to prioritize the use of limited resources and to ensure a rapid coordinated response by the entire affected community so that the maximum number of lives are saved, property is preserved and protected, and basic health care needs are met in the aftermath of any incident that results in mass casualties (FEMA, 2019). State authorities must request federal assistance with resources through appropriate government channels. A request for federal resources generally is made when local resources have become or are expected to become depleted.</p>
<p class="indent">Federal agencies that may provide resources in response to an MCI or a disaster include the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security (see <a href="#tt68-1">Table 68-1</a>). Each of these federal departments oversees hundreds of agencies that may respond to MCIs.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses may be called upon to volunteer to provide support to select agencies or programs set up to respond to an MCI or a disaster. For example, Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) organize voluntary medical personnel who can set up and staff a field hospital; DMATs are located across the country. Teams deploy with enough personnel, supplies, and equipment to be self-sufficient for 72 hours at a fixed or temporary medical site. During MCIs, team responsibilities may include triage, providing medical care despite adverse conditions, and preparing patients for evacuation (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Department of Homeland Security, through the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS), designates a level of security threat that is intended to alert the country to credible threats of terrorism. The NTAS notes two levels of terrorism threats, which include <em>bulletins</em> and <em>alerts</em>. An NTAS bulletin describes trends and developments in threats of terrorism; whereas, an NTAS alert more fully warns of a credible threat of terrorism within the United States. The NTAS alerts may be more specifically designated as an <em>elevated alert</em>, meaning that there is indeed a credible alert posted, or an <em>imminent alert,</em> meaning that there is a specific pending threat of terrorism within the United States (Department of Homeland Security [NTAS], 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Additional support during disasters is available from the American Red Cross, which provides support systems and shelters as needed. A nongovernment, nonprofit agency, the American Red Cross mobilizes support for those in need <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2220" title="2220"></span>because of the effects of disasters through training and mobilizing volunteers.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided an abundance of education addressing safety measures to combat the virus and precautions for populations at risk and offered regulatory guidance. These important regulations have informed government decisions enacted to ensure the safety of individuals during the pandemic (CDC, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these measures, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated the review of diagnostic tests to mitigate the spread of the virus. The FDA was responsible for ensuring that testing methods would provide both accurate and reliable results (FDA, 2020). Congress enacted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that relaxed regulations and ultimately increased the availability of tests. The FDA then revised their standard procedures to allow for laboratory testing prior to FDA validation assessment, an unprecedented policy change that also allowed for increased testing capabilities (FDA, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3277">State and Local Agencies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">State and local resources that might be mobilized in response to a disaster may include branches of the CDC or American Red Cross, poison control centers, and other local volunteer organizations. The Metropolitan Medical Response Team Systems are local teams of health care providers located in cities considered possible terrorist targets who are funded for specialty responses. Many state and federal task forces have been developed to assist in the development and improvement of civilian medical response to chemical and biologic terrorism.</p>
<p class="indent">Most cities and all states have an Office of Emergency Management (OEM) or Office of Emergency Services (OES). The OEM/OES coordinates the disaster relief efforts at the state and local levels. The OEM/OES is responsible for providing interagency coordination during an emergency. It maintains a corps of emergency management personnel, including a leader, responders, planners, and administrative and support staff (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Toner, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">State and local governments play the primary role in the management of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, until a request is made by a state that federal assistance is needed (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). The Public Health Service (PHS) and FEMA are the two federal agencies that coordinate these efforts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FEMA partnered with HHS to ensure adequacy of medical supplies and testing sites (FEMA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3278">The Incident Command System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Incident Command System (ICS) is a federally mandated command structure that coordinates personnel, facilities, equipment, and communication in any emergency situation. The ICS is the center of operations for organization, planning, and transport of patients in the event of a specific local MCI. Successful incident management requires equipment <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2221" title="2221"></span>compatibility, effective communication, adequate distribution of resources, and clear differentiation of members&#x2019; roles. The ICS ensures that any hazardous substances used during an MCI are identified promptly and that appropriate <strong>personal protective equipment (PPE)</strong> is distributed. PPE describes the use of equipment beyond standard precautions and may include different levels of protection, depending on the nature of the suspected biologic, chemical, or radiologic event (see later discussion). In addition to these responsibilities, the ICS is also responsible for determining when an MCI has ended (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is a modification of the ICS that is used by both hospitals and law enforcement agencies. The HICS incident commander is the hospital emergency preparedness coordinator who oversees and coordinates all efforts surrounding the event. The HICS team includes a safety officer, public information officer, liaison officer, operations chief, logistics chief, planning chief, and finance chief. Each team member has a specific responsibility and communicates directly back to the incident commander (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
