<h4 class="h4" id="s1848">Hepatitis G Virus and GB Virus-C</h4>
<p class="nonindent">It has long been believed that there is another non-A&#x2013;E agent causing hepatitis in humans. The incubation period for posttransfusion hepatitis is 14 to 145 days&#x2014;too long for hepatitis B or C. In the United States, about 5% of chronic liver disease remains cryptogenic (i.e., does not appear to be autoimmune or viral in origin), and 50% of these patients have received blood transfusions before developing disease. Therefore, another form of hepatitis, referred to as hepatitis G virus (HGV) or GB virus-C (GBV-C), has been described; these are thought to be two different isolates of the same virus, which are percutaneously transmitted. Autoantibodies are absent.</p>
<p class="indent">The clinical significance of this virus remains uncertain. Risk factors are similar to those for hepatitis C. There is no clear relationship between HGV/GBV-C infection and progressive liver disease. Persistent infection does occur but does not affect the clinical course (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Sedhom et al., 2018</a>).</p>
