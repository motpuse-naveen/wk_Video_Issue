<h4 class="h4" id="s2881">Chronic Otitis Media</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chronic otitis media:&lt;/b&gt; repeated episodes of acute otitis media causing irreversible tissue damage">Chronic otitis media</button></strong> is recurrent AOM that causes irreversible tissue pathology. Chronic infections of the middle ear damage the tympanic membrane, destroy the ossicles, and involve the mastoid but are rare in developed countries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2882">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms may be minimal, with varying degrees of hearing loss and a persistent or intermittent, foul-smelling otorrhea. Pain is not usually experienced, except in cases of acute mastoiditis, when the postauricular area is tender and may be erythematous and edematous. Otoscopic examination may show a perforation, and cholesteatoma can be identified as a white mass behind the tympanic membrane or coming through to the external canal from a perforation.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cholesteatoma:&lt;/b&gt; tumor of the middle ear or mastoid, or both, that can destroy structures of the temporal bone">Cholesteatoma</button></strong> is a cystlike lesion of the external layer of the eardrum into the middle ear. It is generally caused by a chronic retraction pocket of the tympanic membrane, creating a persistently high negative pressure of the middle ear. The skin forms a sac that fills with degenerated skin and sebaceous materials. The sac can attach to the structures of the middle ear, mastoid, or both.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic otitis media can cause chronic mastoiditis and lead to the formation of cholesteatoma. The location will dictate the type of surgery to be performed. If untreated, cholesteatoma will continue to enlarge, possibly causing damage to the facial nerve and horizontal canal and destruction of other surrounding structures.</p>
<p class="indent">Cholesteatomas are cystlike lesions of the middle ear (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>). They usually do not cause pain; however, if treatment or surgery is delayed, they may burst or destroy the mastoid bone. Cholesteatomas found in older adult patients generally develop in the external canal.</p>
<p class="indent">Cholesteatomas may be asymptomatic, or they may cause hearing loss, facial pain and paralysis, tinnitus, or vertigo. Audiometric tests often show a conductive or mixed hearing loss. Based on presenting symptoms, diagnosis may be made by visual examination or by computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan. Therapy includes treatment of the acute infection and surgical removal of the mass to restore hearing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2883">Medical Management <img class="m" src="images/icon04wl.jpg" alt=""/></h5>

<p class="nonindent">Local treatment for chronic otitis media consists of careful suctioning of the ear under otoscopic guidance. Instillation of antibiotic drops or application of antibiotic powder is used to treat purulent discharge. Systemic antibiotic agents are prescribed only in cases of acute infection.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical procedures, including tympanoplasty, ossiculoplasty, and mastoidectomy, are used if medical treatments are ineffective.</p>
<p class="h7">Tympanoplasty</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common surgical procedure for chronic otitis media is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tympanoplasty:&lt;/b&gt; surgical repair of the tympanic membrane">tympanoplasty</button></strong>, or surgical reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. Reconstruction of the ossicles may also be required. The purposes of a tympanoplasty are to reestablish middle ear function, close the perforation, prevent recurrent infection, and improve hearing.</p>
<p class="indent">There are five types of tympanoplasties. The simplest surgical procedure, type I (myringoplasty), is designed to close a perforation in the tympanic membrane. The other procedures, types II through V, involve more extensive repair of middle ear structures. The structures and the degree of involvement can differ, but all tympanoplasty procedures include restoring the continuity of the sound conduction mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">Tympanoplasty is performed through the external auditory canal with a transcanal approach or through a postauricular incision. The contents of the middle ear are carefully inspected, and the ossicular chain (malleus and incus unit) is evaluated. Ossicular interruption is most common in chronic otitis media, but problems of reconstruction can also occur with malformations of the middle ear and ossicular dislocations due to head injuries. Dramatic improvement in hearing can result from closure of a perforation and reestablishment of the ossicles. Surgery is usually performed in an outpatient facility under moderate sedation or general anesthesia.</p>
<p class="h7">Ossiculoplasty</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ossiculoplasty:&lt;/b&gt; surgical reconstruction of the middle ear bones to restore hearing">Ossiculoplasty</button></strong> is the surgical reconstruction of the middle ear bones to restore hearing. Prostheses made of materials such as Teflon, stainless steel, and hydroxyapatite are used to reconnect the ossicles, thereby reestablishing the sound conduction mechanism. However, the greater the damage, the lower the success rate for restoring normal hearing.</p>
<p class="h7">Mastoidectomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of mastoid surgery are to remove the cholesteatoma, gain access to diseased structures, and create a dry (noninfected) and healthy ear. If possible, the ossicles are reconstructed during the initial surgical procedure. Occasionally, extensive disease or damage dictates that this be performed as part of a two-stage operation.</p>
<p class="indent">A mastoidectomy is usually performed through a postauricular incision. Infection is eliminated by removing the mastoid air cells. A second mastoidectomy may be necessary to check for recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. The hearing mechanism may be reconstructed at this time. The success rate for correcting this conductive hearing loss is approximately 75%. Surgery is usually performed in an outpatient setting. The patient has a mastoid pressure dressing, which can be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Although infrequently injured, the facial nerve, which runs through the middle ear and mastoid, is at some risk for injury during mastoid surgery. As the patient awakens from anesthesia, any evidence of facial paresis should be reported to the primary provider.</p>

<p class="processptitle"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing process:&lt;/b&gt; a systematic, problem-solving approach for meeting people&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs; components involve assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation">NURSING PROCESS</button></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse52"><strong>The Patient Undergoing Mastoid Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Although several otologic surgical procedures are performed under moderate sedation, mastoid surgery is performed using general anesthesia.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The health history includes a complete description of the ear disorder, including infection, otalgia, otorrhea, hearing loss, and vertigo. Data are collected about the duration and intensity of the disorder, its causes, and previous treatments. Information is obtained about other health problems and all medications that the patient is taking. Medication allergies and family history of ear disease also should be obtained.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Physical assessment addresses erythema, edema, otorrhea, lesions, and characteristics such as odor and color of discharge. The results of the audiogram are reviewed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Diagnoses</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with surgical procedure, potential loss of hearing, potential taste disturbance, and potential loss of facial movement</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with mastoid surgery</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for infection associated with mastoidectomy; placement of grafts, prostheses, and electrodes; and surgical trauma to surrounding tissues and structures</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired verbal communication associated with ear disorder, surgery, or packing</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for injury associated with impaired balance or vertigo during the immediate postoperative period, dislodgment of the graft or prosthesis, or injury to facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and chorda tympani nerve</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about mastoid disease, surgical procedure, and postoperative care and expectations</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Major goals of caring for a patient undergoing mastoidectomy include reduction of anxiety, freedom from pain and discomfort, prevention of infection, stable or improved hearing and communication, absence of vertigo and related injury, and increased knowledge regarding the disease, surgical procedure, and postoperative care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EDUCING</span> A<span class="small">NXIETY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse reinforces the information discussed by the otologic surgeon with the patient, including anesthesia, the location of the incision (postauricular), and expected surgical results (e.g., hearing, balance, taste, facial movement). The patient also is encouraged to discuss any anxieties and concerns about the surgery.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">ELIEVING</span> P<span class="small">AIN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Although most patients complain very little about incisional pain after mastoid surgery, they do have some ear discomfort. Aural fullness or pressure after surgery is caused by residual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1951" title="1951"></span>blood or fluid in the middle ear. The prescribed analgesic medication may be taken for the first 24 hours after surgery and then only as needed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A wick or external auditory canal packing is used if tympanoplasty was performed at the time of the mastoidectomy. For the next 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, the patient may experience sharp, shooting pains intermittently as the eustachian tube opens and allows air to enter the middle ear. Constant, throbbing pain accompanied by fever may indicate infection and should be reported to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> I<span class="small">NFECTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Measures are initiated to prevent infection in the operated ear. The external auditory canal wick, or packing, may be impregnated with an antibiotic solution before instillation. Prophylactic antibiotic agents are given as prescribed, and the patient is instructed to prevent water from entering the external auditory canal for 6 weeks. A cotton ball or lamb&#x2019;s wool covered with a water-insoluble substance (e.g., petroleum jelly) and placed loosely in the ear canal usually prevents water from entering the ear canal and should be used when the patient showers or washes their hair, or in any situations in which water may enter the ear canal. The postauricular incision should be kept dry for the first 2&#x00A0;days. Signs of infection such as an elevated temperature and purulent drainage should be reported. Some serosanguineous drainage from the external auditory canal is normal after surgery.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> H<span class="small">EARING AND</span> C<span class="small">OMMUNICATION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Hearing in the operated ear may be reduced for several weeks because of edema, accumulation of blood and tissue fluid in the middle ear, and dressings or packing. Measures are initiated to improve hearing and communication, such as reducing environmental noise, facing the patient when speaking, speaking clearly and distinctly without shouting, providing good lighting, and using nonverbal clues (e.g., facial expression, pointing, gestures), writing, picture boards, electronic tablets, and other forms of communication. Family members or significant others are instructed about effective ways to communicate with the patient. If the patient uses assistive hearing devices, one can be used in the unaffected ear.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> I<span class="small">NJURY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Vertigo may occur after mastoid surgery if the semicircular canals or other areas of the inner ear are traumatized. Antiemetic or antivertiginous medications (e.g., antihistamines) can be prescribed if a balance disturbance or vertigo occurs. Safety measures such as assisted ambulation are implemented to prevent falls and injury. The patient is instructed to avoid heavy lifting, straining, exertion, and nose blowing for 2 to 3&#x00A0;weeks after surgery to prevent dislodging the tympanic membrane graft or ossicular prosthesis.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Facial nerve injury is a potential, although rare, complication of mastoid surgery. The patient is instructed to report immediately any evidence of facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) weakness, such as drooping of the mouth on the operated side, slurred speech, decreased sensation, and difficulty swallowing. A more frequent occurrence is a temporary disturbance in the chorda tympani nerve, which is a small branch of the facial nerve that runs through the middle ear. Patients experience a taste disturbance and dry mouth on the side of surgery for several months until the nerve regenerates.</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Self-Care After Middle Ear or Mastoid Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Postoperative instructions for patients who have had middle ear and mastoid surgery may vary among otolaryngologists. The nurse instructs the patient in the following general guidelines:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take antibiotics and other medications as prescribed.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid nose blowing for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sneeze and cough with the mouth open for a few weeks after surgery.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid heavy lifting (&#x003E;10 lb), straining, and bending over for a few weeks after surgery.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that popping and crackling sensations in the operative ear are normal for approximately 3 to 5 weeks after surgery.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Note that temporary hearing loss is normal in the operative ear due to fluid, blood, or packing in the ear.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Report excessive or purulent ear drainage to the physician.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid getting water in the operative ear for 2 weeks after surgery. You may shampoo the hair 2 to 3 days postoperatively if the ear is protected from water by saturating a cotton ball with petroleum jelly (or some other water-insoluble substance) and loosely placing it in the ear. If the postauricular suture line becomes wet, pat (not rub) the area and cover it with a thin layer of antibiotic ointment.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patients require education about medication therapy, such as analgesic and antivertiginous agents (e.g., antihistamines) prescribed for balance disturbance. Education includes information about the expected effects and potential side effects of the medication. Patients also need instruction about any activity restrictions. Possible complications such as infection, facial nerve weakness, or taste disturbances, including the signs and symptoms to report immediately, are included (see <a href="#ct59-7">Chart 59-7</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Some patients, particularly older adult patients, who have had mastoid surgery may require the services of a home, community-based, or transitional care nurse for a few days after returning home. However, most people find that assistance from a family member or a friend is sufficient. The caregiver and patient are cautioned that the patient may experience some vertigo and will therefore require help with ambulation to avoid falling. Any symptoms of complications are to be reported promptly to the primary provider. The importance of scheduling and keeping follow-up appointments is also stressed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
