<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;informed consent:&lt;/b&gt; the patient&#x2019;s autonomous decision about whether to undergo a surgical procedure, based on the nature of the condition, the treatment options, and the risks and benefits involved">Informed consent</button></strong> is the patient&#x2019;s autonomous decision about whether to undergo a surgical procedure. Voluntary and written informed consent from the patient is necessary before nonemergent surgery can be performed to protect the patient from unsanctioned surgery and protect the surgeon from claims of an unauthorized operation or battery. Consent is a legal mandate, but it also helps the patient to prepare psychologically, because it helps to ensure that the patient understands the surgery to be performed (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is the surgeon&#x2019;s and the anesthesiologist&#x2019;s responsibility to provide a clear and simple explanation of what the surgery will entail prior to the patient giving consent. The surgeon must also inform the patient of the benefits, alternatives, possible risks, complications, disfigurement, disability, and removal of body parts as well as what to expect in the early and late postoperative periods. The nurse clarifies the information provided, verifies the presence of the patient&#x2019;s or designee&#x2019;s signature, and may be asked to sign as a witness. If at any point the patient requests additional information, or if the nurse feels that the patient may not understand, the nurse notifies the physician. The nurse ascertains that the consent form has been signed before administering psychoactive premedication, because consent is not valid if it is obtained while the patient is under the influence of medications that can affect judgment and decision making capacity.</p>

<p class="indent">Many ethical principles are integral to informed consent. Informed consent is necessary in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Invasive procedures, such as a surgical incision, a biopsy, a cystoscopy, or paracentesis</span></li>
<li><span>Procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia (see <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> for a discussion of anesthesia)</span></li>
<li><span>A nonsurgical procedure, such as an arteriography, that carries more than a slight risk to the patient</span></li>
<li><span>Procedures involving radiation</span></li>
<li><span>Blood product administration</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The patient personally signs the consent if of legal age and mentally capable. Permission is otherwise obtained from a surrogate, who most often is a responsible family member (preferably next of kin) or legal guardian (see <a href="#ct14-2">Chart&#x00A0;14-2</a> for criteria for valid informed consent). State regulations and agency policy must be followed. In an emergency, it may be necessary for the surgeon to operate as a lifesaving measure without the patient&#x2019;s informed consent. However, every effort must be made to contact the patient&#x2019;s family. In such a situation, contact can be made by telephone, fax, or other electronic means and consent obtained.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Valid Informed Consent</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Voluntary Consent</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Valid consent must be freely given, without coercion. Patient must be at least 18 years of age (unless an emancipated minor), a physician must obtain consent, and a professional staff member must witness patient&#x2019;s signature.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Patient Who Is Incompetent</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Legal definition: individual who is <em>not</em> autonomous and cannot give or withhold consent (e.g., individuals who are cognitively impaired, mentally ill, or neurologically incapacitated).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Informed Subject</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Informed consent should be in writing. It should contain the following:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Explanation of procedure and its risks</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Description of benefits and alternatives</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An offer to answer questions about procedure</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Instructions that the patient may withdraw consent</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A statement informing the patient if the protocol differs from customary procedure</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Patient Able to Comprehend</strong></p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">If the patient is non-English speaking, it is necessary to provide consent (written and verbal) in a language that is understandable to the patient. A trained medical interpreter may be consulted. Alternative formats of communication (e.g., Braille, large print, sign interpreter) may be needed if the patient has a disability that affects vision or hearing. Questions must be answered to facilitate comprehension if material is confusing.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If the patient has doubts and has not had the opportunity to investigate alternative treatments, a second opinion may be requested. No patient should be urged or coerced to give informed consent. Refusing to undergo a surgical procedure is a person&#x2019;s legal right and privilege. Such information must be documented and relayed to the surgeon so that other arrangements can be made. Additional explanations may be provided to the patient and family, or the surgery may be rescheduled. Consents for specific procedures such as sterilization, therapeutic abortion, disposal of severed body parts, organ donation, and blood product administration provide additional protection for the patient (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). States and regions may vary in their mandates.</p>
<p class="indent">Discussion with patients and their family members may be supplemented with audiovisual materials. Consent forms should be written in easily understandable words and concepts to facilitate the consent process and should use other strategies and resources as needed to help the patient understand the content (see <a href="#ct14-2">Chart&#x00A0;14-2</a>). Asking patients to describe in their own words the surgery they are about to have promotes nurses&#x2019; understanding of patients&#x2019; comprehension.</p>
<p class="indent">A completed, updated and signed <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;history and physical:&lt;/b&gt; mandatory form completed by the surgeon that gives a comprehensive overview of the patient&#x2019;s history, current physical status, and plan of care">History and Physical</button></strong> must be present prior to the patient entering the OR. Not more than 30 days before the date of the scheduled surgery, each patient must have a comprehensive medical history <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page402" title="402"></span>and physical assessment. The primary provider is required to update the form within 24 hours of scheduled surgery on all non-inpatient clients (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1242">Joint Commission, 2019</a>). The History and Physical consists of the history of present illness; surgical, medical, social, and family histories; allergies; current medications; and plan of care. It is the surgical team&#x2019;s responsibility to make sure the presence of these forms and all other supporting documentation (medication reconciliation, Power of Attorney form, etc.) are current and accurate in the preoperative area.</p>
