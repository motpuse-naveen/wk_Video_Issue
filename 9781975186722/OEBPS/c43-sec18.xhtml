<h4 class="h4a" id="s1849">NONVIRAL HEPATITIS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Certain chemicals have toxic effects on the liver and produce acute liver cell necrosis or toxic hepatitis when inhaled, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1392" title="1392"></span>injected parenterally, or taken by mouth. Some chemicals commonly implicated in this disease include carbon tetrachloride and phosphorus. These substances are true hepatotoxins. Many medications can induce hepatitis but are only sensitizing rather than toxic. Drug-induced hepatitis is similar to acute viral hepatitis, but parenchymal destruction tends to be more extensive. Medications that can lead to hepatitis include isoniazid, halothane, acetaminophen, methyldopa, and certain antibiotics, antimetabolites, and anesthetic agents.</p>
