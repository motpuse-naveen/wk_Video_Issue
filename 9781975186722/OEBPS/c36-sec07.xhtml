<h4 class="h4" id="s1482">Musculoskeletal Infections</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1483">Osteomyelitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone that results in inflammation, necrosis, and formation of new bone. Osteomyelitis is classified as follows (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Hematogenous osteomyelitis (i.e., due to bloodborne spread of infection)</span></li>
<li><span>Contiguous-focus osteomyelitis, from contamination from bone surgery (especially with hardware insertion), open fracture, or traumatic injury (e.g., gunshot wound)</span></li>
<li><span>Osteomyelitis with vascular insufficiency, seen most commonly among patients with diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, most commonly affecting the feet</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patients who are at high risk for osteomyelitis include older adults and those who are poorly nourished or obese. Other patients at risk include those with impaired immune systems, those with chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes, RA), those receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy or immunosuppressive agents, and those who use illicit IV drugs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lalani &#x0026; Schmidt, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative surgical wound infections typically occur within 30 days after surgery. They are classified as incisional (superficial, located above the deep fascia layer) or deep (involving tissue beneath the deep fascia). If an implant has been used, deep postoperative infections may occur within a year. Osteomyelitis may become chronic and may affect the patient&#x2019;s quality of life.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1484">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">More than 50% of bone infections are caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and increasingly of the variety that is methicillin resistant (i.e., MRSA) (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lalani &#x0026; Schmidt, 2019</a>). Surgical site ink markers have been linked to infections by cross contamination between preoperative patients who use their markers; therefore, these items are now considered one patient or one-time use items (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Driessche, 2012</a>). Other pathogens include the gram-positive organisms <em>streptococci</em> and <em>enterococci,</em> followed by gram-negative bacteria, including <em>pseudomonas</em> (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lalani &#x0026; Schmidt, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The initial response to infection is inflammation, increased vascularity, and edema. After 2 or 3 days, thrombosis of the local blood vessels occurs, resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis. The infection extends into the medullary cavity and under the periosteum and may spread into adjacent soft tissues and joints. Unless the infective process is treated promptly, a bone abscess forms. The resulting abscess cavity contains <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sequestrum:&lt;/b&gt; dead bone in abscess cavity">sequestrum</button></strong> (i.e., dead bone tissue), which does not easily liquefy and drain. Therefore, the cavity cannot collapse and heal, as it does in soft tissue abscesses. New bone growth, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;involucrum:&lt;/b&gt; new bone growth around a sequestrum">involucrum</button></strong>, forms and surrounds the sequestrum. Although healing appears to take place, a chronically infected sequestrum remains and produces recurring abscesses throughout the patient&#x2019;s life. This is referred to as chronic osteomyelitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1485">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When the infection is bloodborne, the onset is usually sudden, occurring often with the clinical and laboratory manifestations of sepsis (e.g., chills, high fever, rapid pulse, general malaise). The systemic symptoms at first may overshadow the local signs. As the infection extends through the cortex of the bone, it involves the periosteum and the soft tissues. The infected area becomes painful, swollen, and extremely tender. The patient may describe a constant, pulsating pain that intensifies with movement as a result of the pressure of the collecting purulent material (i.e., pus). When osteomyelitis occurs from spread of adjacent infection or from direct contamination, there are no manifestations of sepsis. The surface area that lies over the infected bone is swollen, warm, painful, and tender to touch. The patient with chronic osteomyelitis presents with a nonhealing ulcer that overlies the infected bone with a connecting sinus that will intermittently and spontaneously drain pus (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lalani &#x0026; Schmidt, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Diabetic osteomyelitis can occur without any external wounds. It may present as a nonhealing fracture. Microvascular and macrovascular pathophysiologic changes, along with an impaired immune response by patients with diabetes who have poor glycemic control can exacerbate the spread of infection from other sources. Any foot ulcer more than 2 cm in diameter is highly suspicious for osteomyelitis (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lalani &#x0026; Schmidt, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1486">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In acute osteomyelitis, early x-ray findings demonstrate soft tissue edema. In about 2 to 3 weeks, areas of periosteal elevation and bone necrosis are evident. Radioisotope bone scans and MRI help with early definitive diagnosis. Blood studies reveal leukocytosis and an elevated ESR. Wound and blood culture studies are performed, although they are only positive in 50% of cases. Therefore, treatment with antibiotics may be prescribed without isolating the organism and then refined after results are obtained. IV antibiotics and bone biopsies are preferably done prior to starting the antibiotics (Osmon &#x0026; Tande, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">With chronic osteomyelitis, large, irregular cavities, raised periosteum, sequestrum, or dense bone formations are seen on x-ray. Bone scans may be performed to identify areas of infection. The ESR and the WBC count are usually normal. Anemia, associated with chronic infection, may be evident. Cultures of blood specimens and drainage from the sinus tract are frequently unreliable for isolating the organisms involved. Bone cultures are aspirated through uninfected skin (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lalani &#x0026; Schmidt, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1487">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention of osteomyelitis is the goal. Elective orthopedic surgery should be postponed if the patient has a current infection (e.g., urinary tract infection, sore throat that may suggest a <em>Streptococcal</em> infection). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1143" title="1143"></span>During surgery, careful attention is paid to the surgical environment. Prophylactic antibiotics, given to achieve adequate tissue levels at the time of surgery and for 24 hours after surgery, are helpful. Urinary catheters and drains are removed as soon as possible to decrease the incidence of hematogenous spread of infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Aseptic postoperative wound care reduces the incidence of superficial infections and osteomyelitis. Prompt management of soft tissue infections reduces extension of infection to the bone or hematogenous spread.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1488">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The initial goal of therapy is to control and halt the infective process. General supportive measures (e.g., hydration, diet high in vitamins and protein, correction of anemia) are instituted. The area affected with osteomyelitis is immobilized to decrease discomfort and to prevent pathologic fracture of the weakened bone.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bone infections are more difficult to eradicate than soft tissue infections because bone is mostly avascular and less accessible to the body&#x2019;s natural immune response. Because there is decreased penetration by medications, antibiotic therapy is longer term than with other infections; typically, it continues for 6 to 12 weeks. After the infection appears to be controlled, the antibiotic may be given orally. However, there is little evidence to support optimal length of therapy (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2586">Li, Romach, Zabellas, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the infection is chronic and does not respond to antibiotic therapy, surgical d&#x00E9;bridement is indicated. The infected bone is surgically exposed, the purulent and necrotic material is removed, and the area is irrigated with sterile saline solution. A sequestrectomy (removal of enough involucrum to enable the surgeon to remove the sequestrum) is performed. In many cases, sufficient bone is removed to convert a deep cavity into a shallow saucer (saucerization). All dead, infected bone and cartilage must be removed before permanent healing can occur. A closed suction irrigation system may be used to remove debris. Wound irrigation using sterile physiologic saline solution may be performed for extended periods if the debris remains. Typically, irrigation does not need to extend beyond a week.</p>
<p class="indent">The wound is either closed tightly to obliterate the dead space or packed and closed later by granulation or possibly by grafting. The d&#x00E9;brided cavity may be packed with cancellous bone graft to stimulate healing. With a large defect, the cavity may be filled with a vascularized bone transfer or muscle flap (in which a muscle is moved from an adjacent area with blood supply intact). These microsurgery techniques enhance the blood supply. The improved blood supply facilitates bone healing and eradication of the infection. These surgical procedures may be staged over time to ensure healing. Because surgical d&#x00E9;bridement weakens the bone, internal fixation or external supportive devices may be needed to stabilize or support the bone to prevent pathologic fracture (R&#x00FC;schenschmidt, Glombitza, Dahmen, et&#x00A0;al., 2019). Original orthopedic hardware may need to be removed.</p>

<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse23"><strong>The Patient with Osteomyelitis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient reports an acute onset of signs and symptoms (e.g., localized pain, edema, erythema, fever) or recurrent drainage of an infected sinus with associated pain, edema, and low-grade fever. The nurse assesses the patient for risk factors (e.g., older age, diabetes, long-term corticosteroid therapy) and for a history of previous injury, infection, or orthopedic surgery. The gait may be altered as the patient avoids pressure and movement of the area. In acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, the patient exhibits generalized weakness due to the systemic reaction to the infection.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Physical examination reveals an inflamed, markedly edematous, warm area that is tender. Purulent drainage may be noted. The patient has an elevated temperature. With chronic osteomyelitis, the temperature elevation may be minimal, occurring in the afternoon or evening.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with inflammation and edema</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired mobility associated with pain, use of immobilization devices, and weight-bearing limitations</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for infection: bone abscess formation</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rLast"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge associated with the treatment regimen</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient&#x2019;s goals may include relief of pain, improved physical mobility within therapeutic limitations, control and eradication of infection, and knowledge of the treatment regimen.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The affected part may be immobilized with a splint to decrease pain and muscle spasm. The nurse monitors the skin and neurovascular status of the affected extremity. The wounds are frequently very painful, and the extremity must be handled with great care and gentleness. Elevation reduces swelling and associated discomfort. Pain is controlled with prescribed analgesic agents and other pain-reducing techniques.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> P<small>HYSICAL</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Treatment regimens restrict weight-bearing activity. The bone is weakened by the infective process and must be protected by avoidance of stress on the bone. The patient must understand the rationale for the activity restrictions. The joints above and below the affected part should be gently moved through their range of motion. The nurse encourages full participation in ADLs within the prescribed physical limitations to promote general well-being. Caution around external fixation devices is required (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> for discussion of external fixation devices).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>ONTROLLING</small> <small>THE</small> I<small>NFECTIOUS</small> P<small>ROCESS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s response to antibiotic therapy and observes the IV access site for evidence of phlebitis, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1144" title="1144"></span>infection, or infiltration. With long-term, intensive antibiotic therapy, the patient is monitored for signs of superinfection (e.g., oral or vaginal candidiasis, loose or foul-smelling stools). The nurse carefully monitors for the development of additional sites that are painful or for sudden increases in body temperature.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If surgery is necessary, the nurse takes measures to ensure adequate circulation to the affected area (wound suction to prevent fluid accumulation, elevation of the area to promote venous drainage, avoidance of pressure on the grafted area), to maintain needed immobility, and to ensure the patient&#x2019;s adherence to weight-bearing restrictions. Dressings are changed using aseptic technique to promote healing and to prevent cross contamination.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt="icon" /> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient and family are educated about the importance of strictly adhering to the therapeutic regimen of antibiotics. Patients and families often need to learn to maintain and manage the IV access and IV administration equipment in the home. Education includes the medication name, dosage, frequency, administration rate, safe storage and handling, adverse reactions, and necessary laboratory monitoring. In addition, the nurse provides education on aseptic dressing and warm compression techniques.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The patient must be medically stable and physically able and motivated to adhere strictly to the therapeutic regimen of antibiotic therapy. The transitional care environment needs to be conducive to the promotion of health and to the requirements of the therapeutic regimen.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If warranted, the nurse completes a home assessment to determine the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s abilities regarding continuation of the therapeutic regimen. If the patient&#x2019;s support system is questionable or if the patient lives alone, a home health nurse may be needed to assist with IV administration of the antibiotics, monitoring for response to the treatment and evaluation of signs and symptoms of superinfections, and adverse drug reactions. This can also be done via telehealth (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2566">Eichler et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The nurse stresses the importance of follow-up health care appointments (see <a href="#ct36-12">Chart 36-12</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1489">Septic (Infectious) Arthritis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Joints can become infected through spread of pathogens from other parts of the body (hematogenous spread) or directly through trauma, injection, or surgical instrumentation, causing septic arthritis. People at greatest risk include older adults, particularly those older than 80 years; people with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, RA, skin infection, or alcoholism; and people with a history of a joint replacement or other joint surgery or IV drug abuse. <em>S. aureus</em> is the most common cause of joint infections in all age groups, followed by other gram-positive bacteria, including streptococci. Gonococcal infection may cause septic arthritis through hematogenous spread. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is a commonly implicated pathogen in those who use illicit IV drugs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Goldenberg &#x0026; Sexton, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Single knee or hip joints are most commonly infected in patients with septic arthritis, although up to 20% of cases involve more than one joint (i.e., polyarticular disease). Prompt recognition and treatment of an infected joint are important because accumulating purulent material may result in chondrolysis (destruction of hyaline cartilage), and continued hematogenous spread may lead to sepsis and death. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for further discussion of sepsis. The overall mortality rate for single joint infections is about 11%, but it approaches 50% in patients with polyarticular disease or in those who are immunocompromised (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2602">Oh, Wurcel, Tybor, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1490">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with acute septic arthritis presents with a warm, painful, swollen joint with decreased range of motion. Systemic chills, fever, and leukocytosis are sometimes present. Fever may not occur in older patients. Although any joint may be infected, approximately half of all cases involve a knee (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Goldenberg &#x0026; Sexton, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1491">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An assessment for the source and cause of infection is performed. Diagnostic studies include aspiration, examination, and culture of the synovial fluid. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans may reveal damage to the joint lining. Radioisotope scanning may be useful in localizing the infectious process. There may not be any external wound or reported recent trauma.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1492">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prompt treatment is essential and may save the prosthesis for patients who have had joint replacement surgery or may prevent sepsis. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics are started promptly and then changed to organism-specific antibiotics after culture results are available (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Goldenberg &#x0026; Sexton, 2019</a>). The IV antibiotics are continued until symptoms resolve. The synovial fluid is aspirated and analyzed periodically for sterility and decrease in WBCs.</p>
<p class="indent">Aspiration of the joint with a needle to remove excessive joint fluid, exudate, and debris promotes comfort and decreases joint destruction caused by the action of proteolytic enzymes in the purulent fluid. Arthrotomy or arthroscopy is used to drain the joint and remove dead tissue (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2602">Oh et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The inflamed joint is supported and immobilized in a functional position by a splint that increases the patient&#x2019;s comfort. Analgesic agents are prescribed to relieve pain. The patient&#x2019;s nutrition and fluid status is monitored. Progressive range-of-motion exercises are prescribed as soon as the patient can begin movement without exacerbating symptoms of acute pain. If septic joints are treated promptly, recovery of normal function is expected. If the articular cartilage was damaged during the inflammatory reaction, joint fibrosis and diminished function may result. The patient is assessed periodically for recurrence over the next year.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1493">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient and family about the septic arthritis physiologic process and explains the importance of supporting the affected joint, adhering to the prescribed antibiotic regimen, inspecting the skin under any splints that may be prescribed, and observing weight-bearing and activity restrictions. The patient must understand that recurrence of infection in the near and far future is possible and is educated about signs and symptoms to observe and report to the primary provider. The same interventions used for the patient with osteomyelitis are planned for the patient with septic arthritis. See previous discussion.</p>
