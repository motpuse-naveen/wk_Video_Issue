<h4 class="h4" id="s1909">Tumors of the Head of the Pancreas</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tumors of the head of the pancreas comprise 60% to 80% of all pancreatic tumors (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). Tumors in this region of the pancreas obstruct the common bile duct where the duct passes through the head of the pancreas to join the pancreatic duct and empty at the ampulla of Vater into the duodenum. The tumors producing the obstruction may arise from the pancreas, the common bile duct, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1441" title="1441"></span>or the ampulla of Vater (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Burrell, S. A., Yeo, T. P., Smeltzer, S. C., et al. (2018a). Symptom clusters in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgical resection: Part I. <em>Oncology Nursing Forum</em>, <em>45</em>(4), e36&#x2013;e52.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to describe patient-reported symptoms and symptom clusters in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgical resection.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study recruited 143 patients with stage II pancreatic cancer undergoing surgical resection alone or with subsequent adjuvant chemoradiation or chemotherapy to participate in a nested, longitudinal, exploratory study through convenient sampling techniques. The Functional Assessment in Cancer Therapy&#x2013;Hepatobiliary questionnaire was used to assess 17 pancreatic cancer symptoms preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 9 months postoperatively. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to identify symptom clusters.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Fatigue, trouble sleeping, poor appetite, trouble digesting food, and weight loss were consistently reported as the most prevalent and severe symptoms. Sixteen distinct symptom clusters were identified within 9 months of surgery. Four core symptom clusters persisted over time: affective, GI, gustatory, and discomfort.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The findings in this study may be used by nurses to provide anticipatory patient and family education and guidance as they begin and continue with their treatment.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndenta">Nurses and other health care providers will be knowledgeable about symptoms and symptom clusters in this population, which may guide assessments and interventions.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1910">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The obstructed flow of bile produces jaundice, clay-colored stools, and dark urine. Malabsorption of nutrients and fat-soluble vitamins may result if the tumor obstructs the entry of bile to the GI tract. Abdominal discomfort or pain and pruritus may be noted, along with anorexia, weight loss, and malaise. If these signs and symptoms are present, cancer of the head of the pancreas is suspected.</p>
<p class="indent">The jaundice of this disease must be differentiated from that due to a biliary obstruction caused by a gallstone in the common duct. Jaundice caused by a gallstone is usually intermittent and occurs more commonly in women and in people with obesity and who have had previous symptoms of gallbladder disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1911">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnostic studies may include duodenography, angiography by hepatic or celiac artery catheterization, pancreatic scanning, PTC, ERCP, and percutaneous needle biopsy of the pancreas. Results of a biopsy of the pancreas may aid in the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1912">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Before extensive surgery can be performed, a period of preparation is necessary because the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and physical condition are often quite compromised. Various liver and pancreatic function studies are performed. A diet high in protein along with pancreatic enzymes, which aid digestion, is often prescribed. Preoperative preparation includes adequate hydration, correction of prothrombin deficiency with vitamin K, and treatment of anemia to minimize postoperative complications. Enteral or parenteral nutrition and blood component therapy are frequently required.</p>
<p class="indent">A biliary drainage procedure may be performed, usually with a catheter via percutaneous access, to relieve the jaundice and, perhaps, to provide time for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Total pancreatectomy (removal of the pancreas) may be performed if there is no evidence of direct extension of the tumor to adjacent tissues or regional lymph nodes. A pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple&#x2019;s procedure or resection) is used for potentially resectable cancer of the head of the pancreas (see <a href="#ff44-7">Fig. 44-7</a>) (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). This procedure involves removal of the gallbladder, a portion of the stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, head of the pancreas, and distal common bile duct. Reconstruction involves anastomosis of the remaining pancreas and stomach to the jejunum (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Townsend et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). A pylorus-preserving pancreaticojejunostomy (PPPD) may also be performed for tumors of the head of the pancreas and may reduce postgastrectomy symptoms and improve overall GI function (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). The result of these procedures is removal of the tumor, allowing flow of bile into the jejunum. If the tumor cannot be excised, the jaundice may be relieved by diverting the bile flow into the jejunum by anastomosing the jejunum to the gallbladder, a procedure known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cholecystojejunostomy:&lt;/b&gt; anastomosis of the jejunum to the gallbladder to divert bile flow">cholecystojejunostomy</button></strong> (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The postoperative management of patients who have undergone a pancreatectomy or a pancreaticoduodenectomy is similar to the management of patients after extensive GI or biliary surgery. The patient&#x2019;s physical status is often suboptimal, increasing the risk of postoperative complications. Hemorrhage, vascular collapse, and hepatorenal failure remain the major postoperative complications. The mortality rate associated with these procedures has decreased because of advances in nutritional support and improved surgical techniques. A nasogastric tube with suction and parenteral nutrition allow the GI tract to rest while promoting adequate nutrition.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1913"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperatively and postoperatively, nursing care is directed toward promoting patient comfort, preventing complications, and assisting the patient to return to and maintain as normal and comfortable a life as possible. The nurse closely monitors the patient in the intensive care unit after surgery; in the immediate postoperative period, multiple IV and arterial lines are used for fluid and blood replacement and hemodynamic monitoring, and a mechanical ventilator may be used. It is important to note and report changes in vital signs, arterial blood gases and pressures, pulse oximetry, laboratory values, and urine output. The nurse must also consider the patient&#x2019;s compromised nutritional status and risk of bleeding. Depending on the type of surgical procedure performed, malabsorption syndrome and diabetes are likely; the nurse must address these issues during acute and long-term patient care.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1441</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1442" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1442">p. 1442</span></div>
<p class="indent">Although the patient&#x2019;s physiologic status is the focus of the health care team in the immediate postoperative period, the patient&#x2019;s psychological and emotional states must be considered, along with those of the family. The patient has undergone a major high-risk surgery and is critically ill; anxiety and depression may affect recovery. The immediate and long-term outcomes of this extensive surgical resection are uncertain, and the patient and family require emotional support and understanding in the critical and stressful preoperative and postoperative periods.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient who has undergone this extensive surgery requires careful and thorough preparation for self-care at home. The nurse educates the patient and family about strategies to relieve pain and discomfort, along with strategies to manage drains, if present, and to care for the surgical incision. The patient and family members may require education about the use of appropriate analgesic medications, parenteral nutrition, wound care, skin care, increasing activity, and management of drainage.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse may need to educate the patient and family about the need for modifications in the diet because of malabsorption and hyperglycemia resulting from the surgery. It is important to educate the patient and family about the continuing need for pancreatic enzyme replacement, a low-fat diet, and vitamin supplementation. The nurse describes&#x2014;verbally and in writing&#x2014;the signs and symptoms of complications and educates the patient and family about indicators of complications that should be reported promptly.</p>
<p class="indent">Discharge of the patient to a long-term care or rehabilitation facility may be warranted after surgery as extensive as pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy, particularly if the patient&#x2019;s preoperative status is not optimal. Information about the education that has been provided is shared with the long-term care staff so that instructions can be clarified and reinforced. During the recovery or long-term phase of care, the patient and family receive further education about self-care in the home.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A referral for home, community-based, or transitional care may be indicated when the patient returns home. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status and the ability of the patient and family to manage needed care. The nurse provides needed physical care and monitors the adequacy of pain management. In addition, it is important to assess the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and monitor the use of enteral or parenteral nutrition, if used. The nurse discusses the use of hospice services with the patient and family and makes a referral if indicated.</p>
