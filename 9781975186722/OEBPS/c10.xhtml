<h3 class="h3">GLOSSARY</h3>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">acidosis:</span> an acid&#x2013;base imbalance characterized by an increase in H<sup>+</sup> concentration (decreased blood pH) (A low arterial pH due to increased H<sup>+</sup> concentration or reduced bicarbonate concentration is called <em>metabolic acidosis;</em> a low arterial pH due to increased PCO<sub>2</sub> is called <em>respiratory acidosis.</em>)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">active transport:</span> physiologic pump that uses energy to move fluid or electrolytes from one region to another</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">alkalosis:</span> an acid&#x2013;base imbalance characterized by a reduction in H<sup>+</sup> concentration or increase in bicarbonate concentration (increased blood pH) (A high arterial pH with either decreased H<sup>+</sup> ion concentration or increased bicarbonate concentration is called <em>metabolic alkalosis;</em> a high arterial pH due to reduced PCO<sub>2</sub> is called <em>respiratory alkalosis.</em>)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">colloid:</span> a fluid containing particles that are nonsoluble and evenly distributed throughout the solution</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">colloid oncotic pressure:</span> osmotic pressure created by the protein (mainly albumin) in the bloodstream (<em>synonym:</em> colloidal osmotic pressure)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">crystalloid:</span> a fluid containing soluble mineral ions and water in solution</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">diffusion:</span> the process by which solutes move from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration; does not require expenditure of energy</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">homeostasis:</span> maintenance of a constant internal equilibrium in a biologic system</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hydrostatic pressure:</span> the pressure created by the weight of fluid against the wall that contains it. In the body, hydrostatic pressure in blood vessels results from the weight of fluid itself and the force resulting from cardiac contraction (<em>synonym:</em> hydraulic pressure)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypertonic solution:</span> a solution with an osmolality higher than that of serum</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypotonic solution:</span> a solution with an osmolality lower than that of serum</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">isotonic solution:</span> a solution with the same osmolality as blood</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">osmolality:</span> the number of milliosmoles (the standard unit of osmotic pressure) per kilogram of solvent; expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page225" title="225"></span>(The term <em>osmolality</em> is used more often than <em>osmolarity</em> to evaluate serum and urine.)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">osmolarity:</span> the number of milliosmoles (the standard unit of osmotic pressure) per liter of solution; expressed as milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L); describes the concentration of solutes or dissolved particles</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">osmosis:</span> the process by which fluid moves across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration; the process continues until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">tonicity:</span> fluid tension or the effect that osmotic pressure of a solution with impermeable solutes exerts on cell size because of water movement across the cell membrane</p>

<p class="nonindent">Fluid and electrolyte balance are dependent on dynamic processes that are crucial for life and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;homeostasis:&lt;/b&gt; a steady state within the body; the stability of the internal environment">homeostasis</button></strong> (the maintenance of a constant internal equilibrium in a biologic system). Potential and actual disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance occur in every setting, with every disorder, and with a variety of changes that affect healthy people as well as those who are ill.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses need to understand the physiology of fluid and electrolyte balance and acid&#x2013;base balance to anticipate, identify, and respond to imbalances. Maintaining the balance of fluid and electrolytes is crucial to the care of patients of every age and in every clinical setting.</p>
