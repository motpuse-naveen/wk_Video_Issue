<h4 class="h4" id="s702">Pulmonary Embolism</h4>
<p class="nonindent">PE refers to the obstruction of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by a thrombus (or thrombi) that originates somewhere in the venous system or in the right side of the heart. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a related condition, refers to thrombus formation in the deep veins, usually in the calf or thigh, but sometimes in the arm, especially in patients with peripherally inserted central catheters. VTE is a term that includes both DVT and PE. (VTE and the medical and nursing management of patients with DVT and with PE are discussed in detail in <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>.)</p>
