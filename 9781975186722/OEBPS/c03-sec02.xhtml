<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;learning:&lt;/b&gt; the act of acquiring knowledge, attitudes, or skills">Learning</button></strong> can be defined as acquiring knowledge, attitudes, or skills. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;teaching:&lt;/b&gt; helping another person learn">Teaching</button></strong> is defined as helping another person learn. These definitions indicate that the teaching&#x2013;learning <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page59" title="59"></span>process is an active one, requiring the involvement of both the teacher and the learner in the effort to reach the desired outcome&#x2014;a change in behavior. The teacher does not simply give knowledge to the learner but instead serves as a facilitator of learning. Although learning can take place without teachers, most people who are attempting to learn new or altered health behaviors benefit from contact with a nurse. The interpersonal interaction between the person and the nurse who is attempting to meet the person&#x2019;s learning needs may be formal or informal, depending on the method and techniques of teaching.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no definitive theory about how learning occurs and how it is affected by teaching. However, learning can be affected by factors, such as readiness to learn, the learning environment, and the teaching techniques used (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Miller &#x0026; Stoeckel, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s31">Learning Readiness</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One of the most significant factors influencing learning is a person&#x2019;s <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;learning readiness:&lt;/b&gt; the optimum time for learning to occur; usually corresponds to the learner&#x2019;s perceived need and desire to obtain specific knowledge">learning readiness</button></strong> or the optimum time for learning to occur, which usually corresponds to the learner&#x2019;s perceived need and desire to obtain specific knowledge. For adults, readiness is based on culture, personal values, physical and emotional status, and past experiences in learning. The &#x201C;teachable moment&#x201D; occurs when the content and skills being taught are congruent with the task to be accomplished (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Miller &#x0026; Stoeckel, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Culture encompasses values, ideals, and behaviors, and the traditions within each culture provide the framework for solving the issues and concerns of daily living. Because people with different cultural backgrounds have different values and lifestyles, choices about health care vary. Culture is a major variable influencing readiness to learn because it affects how people learn and what information can be learned. Sometimes people do not accept health teaching because it conflicts with culturally mediated values. Before beginning health teaching, nurses must conduct an individual cultural assessment instead of relying only on generalized assumptions about a particular culture. A patient&#x2019;s social and cultural patterns must be appropriately incorporated into the teaching&#x2013;learning interaction. See <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#ct4-7">Chart&#x00A0;4-7</a>, which describes cultural assessment components to consider when formulating a teaching plan.</p>
<p class="indent">A person&#x2019;s values include beliefs about behaviors that are desirable and undesirable. The nurse must know what value the patient places on health and health care. In clinical situations, patients express their values through their actions and the level of knowledge pursued (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">deChesnay &#x0026; Anderson, 2020</a>). When the nurse is unaware of the patient&#x2019;s values (cultural and personal), misunderstanding, lack of cooperation, and negative health outcomes may occur (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">McFarland &#x0026; Wehbe-Alamah, 2018</a>). A person&#x2019;s values and behaviors can be either an asset or a deterrent to readiness to learn. Therefore, patients are unlikely to accept health education unless their values and beliefs about health and illness are respected (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Kersey-Matusiak, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Physical readiness is of vital importance, because until the person is physically capable of learning, attempts at teaching and learning may be both futile and frustrating. For example, a person in acute pain is unable to focus attention away from the pain long enough to concentrate on learning. Likewise, a person who is short of breath concentrates on breathing rather than on learning.</p>
<p class="indent">Emotional readiness also affects the motivation to learn. A person who has not accepted an existing illness or the threat of illness is not motivated to learn. A person who does not accept a therapeutic regimen, or who views it as conflicting with their present lifestyle, may consciously avoid learning about it. Until the person recognizes the need to learn and demonstrates an ability to learn, teaching efforts may be thwarted. However, it is not always wise to wait for the person to become emotionally ready to learn, because that time may never come unless the nurse makes an effort to stimulate the person&#x2019;s motivation. For example, a person with colon cancer who has a fasting blood sugar twice the expected normal value may focus only on the cancer diagnosis and exclude or deny the health consequences of an abnormal blood sugar.</p>
<p class="indent">Illness and the threat of illness are usually accompanied by anxiety and stress. Nurses who recognize such reactions can use simple explanations and instructions to alleviate these anxieties and provide further motivation to learn. Because learning involves behavior change, it often produces mild anxiety, which can be a useful motivating factor.</p>
<p class="indent">Emotional readiness can be promoted by creating a warm, accepting, positive atmosphere and by establishing realistic learning goals. When learners achieve success and a feeling of accomplishment, they are often motivated to participate in additional learning opportunities. One example of a strategy that facilitates learner success is the teach-back technique. This technique is used to evaluate the recall and understanding of the learner after health teaching has occurred. It is a useful, in-the-moment feedback and evaluation method because it allows the educator to discover if the learner can effectively verbalize information or demonstrate a particular health behavior (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Miller &#x0026; Stoeckel, 2019</a>). In addition, the teach-back strategy can be used with family members and caregivers to ascertain if they have retained and understood the health content. Having a strategy to actively involve the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page60" title="60"></span>adult learner in making health care decisions and performing self-management skills promotes learner receptivity and motivation to integrate health principles into one&#x2019;s daily life. Furthermore, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;feedback:&lt;/b&gt; the return of information given to a person">feedback</button></strong> (the return of information given to a person) about progress also motivates learning. Such feedback should be presented in the form of positive reinforcement when the learner is successful, and in the form of constructive suggestions for improvement when the learner is unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiential readiness refers to past experiences that influence a person&#x2019;s ability to learn. Previous educational experiences and life experiences in general are significant determinants of a person&#x2019;s approach to learning. People with little or no formal education may not be able to understand the instructional materials presented. People who have had difficulty learning in the past may be hesitant to try again. Many behaviors required for reaching maximum health potential require knowledge, physical skills, and positive attitudes. In their absence, learning may be very difficult and very slow. For example, a person who does not understand the basics of normal <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nutrition:&lt;/b&gt; the science that deals with food and nourishment in humans">nutrition</button></strong> (the science that deals with food and nourishment in humans) may not be able to understand the restrictions of a specific diet. A person who does not view the desired learning as personally meaningful may reject teaching efforts. A person who is not future oriented may be unable to appreciate many aspects of preventive health teaching. Experiential readiness is closely related to emotional readiness, because motivation tends to be stimulated by an appreciation for the need to learn and by those learning tasks that are familiar, interesting, and meaningful.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s32">The Learning Environment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Learning may be optimized by minimizing factors that interfere with the learning process. For example, the room temperature, lighting, noise levels, use of functional assistive devices such as glasses and hearing aids, and other environmental conditions should be appropriate to the learning situation. In addition, the time selected for teaching should be suited to the needs of the individual person. Scheduling a teaching session at a time of day when a patient is fatigued, uncomfortable, or anxious about a pending diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, or when visitors are present, is not conducive to learning. However, if the family is to participate in providing care, the sessions should be scheduled when family members are present so that they can learn any necessary skills or techniques.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s33">Teaching Techniques and Resources</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Teaching techniques and methods enhance learning if they are appropriate to the patient&#x2019;s needs. Nurses use a variety of teaching techniques to educate patients in many different settings. Techniques that are available include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Lectures:</em> Lectures are explanation methods of teaching and should be accompanied by discussion, because discussion affords learners opportunities to express their feelings and concerns, ask questions, and receive clarification.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Group teaching:</em> Group teaching allows people not only to receive needed information but also to feel secure as members of a group (promoting moral support). Assessment and follow-up are imperative to ensure that each person has gained sufficient knowledge and skills. Not all patients relate or learn well in groups.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Demonstration and practice:</em> Demonstration and practice are especially important when teaching skills. The nurse should demonstrate the skill and then give the learner ample opportunity for practice. When special equipment is involved, such as syringes or colostomy bags, it is important to teach with the same equipment that will be used in the home setting to avoid confusion, frustration, and mistakes.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Reinforcement and follow-up:</em> Nurses must allow ample time for patients to learn and provide reinforcement. Follow-up sessions are imperative to promote the learner&#x2019;s confidence in their abilities and to plan for additional teaching sessions.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Motivational interviewing:</em> Pilot research suggests that using motivational interviewing as an enhanced educational method in an acute inpatient setting can increase both patient and caregiver knowledge as well as patient self-care (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib185">McKillop, Grace, de Melo Ghisi, 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span><em>Electronic, online, or Internet information:</em> Electronic technologies are used to provide health information. Examples are interactive or noninteractive Internet learning, an online self-paced program, or a structured online course. There are also DVD, CD-ROM, podcasts, and recorded programs available over a television channel.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Teaching aids:</em> Teaching aids include books, pamphlets, pictures, films, slides, audiotapes, models, programmed instruction, other visual aids (e.g., charts), mobile device applications, and computer-assisted learning modules. They are invaluable when used appropriately and can save a significant amount of personnel time and related cost. However, all such aids should be reviewed before use to ensure that they meet the patient&#x2019;s learning needs and are free of advertisements that may confuse the patient. (See Resources section at the end of the chapter for additional information.)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The likelihood of success for educating patients is maximized when nurses, families, and other health care professionals work collaboratively to facilitate learning. Successful learning should result in improved self-care management skills, enhanced self-esteem, confidence, and a willingness to learn in the future. There are specific considerations for educating special populations. <a href="c03-sec03.xhtml#tt3-1">Table&#x00A0;3-1</a> outlines some of the strategies to use when educating people with disability. (See <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;7</a> and <a href="c08.xhtml">8</a> for additional teaching strategies for people with disability and older adults.)</p>
