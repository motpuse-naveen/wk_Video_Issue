<h4 class="h4a" id="s1196">CLONAL STEM CELL DISORDERS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A key feature of hematologic malignancies is the increased proliferation of blood cells from an abnormal single HSC, known as clonal hematopoiesis. Despite this increase in proliferation, the clonal HSCs continue to differentiate, leading to increased myeloid cells, erythroid cells, and platelets in the peripheral blood as well as hyperplasia in the bone marrow (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018b). Figure 30-1 illustrates how hematopoietic malignancies develop and whether they are derived from the myeloid or lymphoid stem cells (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019f).</p>
