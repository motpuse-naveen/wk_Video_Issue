<h4 class="h4" id="s1769">Anorectal Abscess</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An anorectal abscess is caused by obstruction of an anal gland with dried debris, resulting in retrograde infection. People with Crohn&#x2019;s disease or immunosuppressive conditions such as AIDS are particularly susceptible to these infections. Many of these abscesses result in fistulas (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hebra, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An abscess may occur in a variety of spaces in and around the rectum, usually in the path of least resistance, where anatomic structures are in close proximity without hard or thick structures to separate them. Most patients with anorectal abscesses will complain of dull perianal discomfort and itching, and increased pain with defecation. Approximately half will present with perianal edema; only one quarter will report any abnormal fecal discharge, such as pus, mucous, or blood. Only 21% report fever or chills (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hebra, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Prompt surgical treatment to incise and drain the abscess is the treatment of choice, to prevent complications such as fistula formation, fecal incontinence, and sepsis. This may be done in the emergency department or in an outpatient clinic office setting. The wound may be packed with an absorptive dressing (e.g., calcium alginate or hydrofiber) and allowed to heal by granulation (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Hebra, 2018</a>).</p>
