<p class="nonindent">Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome are potentially fatal acute skin disorders characterized by widespread erythema and macule formation with blistering, resulting in epidermal detachment or sloughing and erosion formation. These diseases are believed to be one and the same but manifest along a spectrum of reactions, with toxic epidermal necrolysis being the most severe. The mortality rate from toxic epidermal necrolysis is estimated to be 25% to 35% and from Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome is 1% to 5% (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Kellen &#x0026; Berlin, 2016</a>). Up to 75% of cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome are triggered by a reaction to medications, with antibiotics (especially sulfonamides), anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, allopurinol, and oxicam NSAIDs (e.g., meloxicam) frequently implicated (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Kellen &#x0026; Berlin, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome occur in all ages and have a slight predilection for women. The mean age for patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome is reported to be between 46 and 63 years. However, older adults who take multiple medications may be at greater risk. There appears to be a genetic component to developing toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome. The mechanism leading to toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome seems to be a cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen, Jellinek, &#x0026; Schwartz, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2667">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome are characterized initially by conjunctival burning or itching, cutaneous tenderness, fever, cough, sore throat, headache, extreme malaise, and myalgias (i.e., aches and pains). These signs are followed by a rapid onset of erythema involving much of the skin surface and mucous membranes, including the oral mucosa, conjunctiva, and genitalia. In severe cases of mucosal involvement, there may be danger of damage to the larynx, bronchi, and esophagus from ulcerations. Large, flaccid bullae develop in some areas; in other areas, large sheets of epidermis are shed, exposing the underlying dermis. Fingernails, toenails, eyebrows, and eyelashes may be shed along with the surrounding epidermis. The skin is excruciatingly tender, and the loss of skin leaves a weeping surface similar to that of a total-body, partial-thickness burn (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Kellen &#x0026; Berlin, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2668">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Keratoconjunctivitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are potential complications of toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome. Keratoconjunctivitis can impair vision and result in conjunctival retraction, scarring, and corneal lesions. Sepsis and MODS can be life-threatening (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Kellen &#x0026; Berlin, 2016</a>) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2669">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Histologic studies of frozen skin cells from a fresh lesion and cytodiagnosis of collections of cellular material from a freshly denuded area are conducted. A history of the use of medications known to precipitate toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome may confirm medication reaction as the underlying cause, especially if the medications were prescribed within 4 weeks prior to the onset of illness (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Results from a complete blood count (CBC) may show leukopenia and a normochromic normocytic anemia. Skin biopsy results confirm the diagnosis, showing necrotic keratinocytes with full-thickness epithelial necrosis and detachment (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2670">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of treatment include control of fluid and electrolyte balance, prevention of sepsis, and prevention of ophthalmic complications. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Any medications that may be implicated as precipitating toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome are discontinued immediately. The patient is treated in a regional burn center because aggressive treatment similar to that for severe burns is required. Tissue samples from the nasopharynx, eyes, ears, blood, urine, skin, and unruptured blisters are obtained for culture to identify pathogenic organisms. IV crystalloid fluids are prescribed to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, using parameters similar to those used to guide care of patients with burns. Similarly, thermoregulation, wound care, and pain management guidelines used to treat patients with burns are also implemented (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="c57.xhtml">Chapter 57</a>). Patients frequently require nutritional and metabolic support with total parenteral nutrition (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone), although frequently tried, remains controversial. In many cases, the risk of infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, delayed healing, and difficulty in initiating oral corticosteroids early in the course of the disease outweigh its benefits. Administration of IVIG may provide rapid improvement and skin healing at dosages of 1 g/kg/day for 4 days. Other medications that may be effective include the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Kellen &#x0026; Berlin, 2016</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Protecting the skin with topical agents is crucial. Various topical antibacterial and anesthetic agents are used to prevent wound sepsis and to assist with pain management. Temporary biologic dressings (e.g., pigskin, amniotic membrane) or plastic semipermeable dressings (e.g., Vigilon&#x2122;) may be used to reduce pain, decrease evaporation, and prevent secondary infection until the epithelium regenerates. Meticulous oropharyngeal and eye care is essential when there is involvement of the mucous membranes and the eyes.</p>

<p class="processppara">A careful inspection of the skin is made, including its appearance and the extent of involvement. The normal skin is closely observed to determine if new areas of blisters are developing. Drainage from blisters is monitored for amount, color, and odor. The oral cavity is inspected daily for blistering and erosive lesions; the patient is assessed daily for itching, burning, and dryness of the eyes. The patient&#x2019;s ability to swallow and drink fluids, as well as speak normally, is determined.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s vital signs are monitored, and special attention is given to the presence and character of fever and the respiratory rate, depth, rhythm, and cough. The characteristics and amount of respiratory secretions are observed. Assessment for high fever, tachycardia, and extreme weakness and fatigue is essential because these factors indicate the process of epidermal necrosis, increased metabolic needs, and possible gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosal sloughing. Urine volume, specific gravity, and color are monitored. The insertion sites of IV lines are inspected for signs of local infection. Body weight is recorded daily.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is asked to describe fatigue and pain levels. An attempt is made to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s level of anxiety. The patient&#x2019;s basic coping mechanisms are assessed, and effective coping strategies are identified.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include skin and oral tissue healing, fluid balance, prevention of heat loss, relief of pain, reduced anxiety, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>

<p class="processppara">The local care of the skin is an important area of nursing management. The skin denudes easily, especially when the patient is lifted and turned. The nursing staff must take special care to avoid friction involving the skin when moving the patient in bed. The skin should be checked after each position change to ensure that no new denuded areas have appeared. The nurse applies the prescribed topical agents to reduce the bacterial population of the wound surface. Warm compresses, if prescribed, should be applied gently to denuded areas. The topical antibacterial agent may be used in conjunction with hydrotherapy in a tank, bathtub, or shower. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s condition during the treatment and encourages the patient to exercise the extremities during hydrotherapy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The painful oral lesions make oral hygiene difficult. Careful oral hygiene is performed to keep the oral mucosa clean. Prescribed chlorhexidine mouthwashes, anesthetics, or coating agents are used frequently to rid the mouth of debris, soothe ulcerative areas, and control foul mouth odor. The oral cavity is inspected several times each day, and any changes are documented and reported. Petrolatum or a prescribed ointment is applied to the lips.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<span class="small">TTAINING</span> F<span class="small">LUID</span> B<span class="small">ALANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient&#x2019;s vital signs, urine output, and mental status are assessed for indications of hypovolemia. Mental changes from fluid and electrolyte imbalance, sensory overload, or sensory deprivation may occur. Laboratory test results are evaluated, and abnormal results are reported. The patient is weighed daily.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Oral lesions may result in dysphagia, making tube feeding or parenteral nutrition necessary until oral ingestion can be tolerated. A daily calorie count and accurate recording of all intake and output are essential.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> H<span class="small">YPOTHERMIA</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient with toxic epidermal necrolysis is prone to chilling. Dehydration may be made worse by exposing the denuded skin to a continuous current of warm air. The patient is usually sensitive to changes in room temperature. Measures similar to those implemented for a patient with burns, such as cotton blankets, ceiling-mounted heat lamps, and heat shields, are useful in maintaining body temperature. To minimize shivering and heat loss, the nurse should work rapidly and efficiently when large wounds are exposed for wound care. The patient&#x2019;s temperature is monitored frequently.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">ELIEVING</span> P<span class="small">AIN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s pain, its characteristics, factors that influence the pain, and the patient&#x2019;s behavioral responses. Prescribed analgesic agents are given on a regular schedule, and the nurse documents pain relief and any side effects. Analgesics are given before painful treatments are performed. Providing thorough explanations and speaking calmly to the patient during treatments can allay the anxiety that may intensify pain. Offering emotional support and reassurance and implementing measures that promote rest and sleep are basic in achieving pain control. As the pain diminishes and the patient has more physical and emotional energy, the nurse may educate the patient in self-management techniques for pain relief, such as progressive muscle relaxation and imagery (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EDUCING</span> A<span class="small">NXIETY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because the lifestyle of the patient with toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome has been abruptly changed to one of complete dependence, an assessment of their emotional state may reveal anxiety, depression, and fear of dying. The patient can be reassured that these reactions are normal. The patient also needs nursing support, honest communication, and hope that the situation can improve. The patient is encouraged to express their feelings. Listening to the patient&#x2019;s concerns and being readily available with skillful and compassionate care are important anxiety-relieving interventions. Emotional support by a psychiatric nurse, spiritual advisor, psychologist, or psychiatrist may be helpful to promote coping during the long recovery period.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ONITORING AND</span> M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> P<span class="small">OTENTIAL</span> C<span class="small">OMPLICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Sepsis.</span> The major cause of death from toxic epidermal necrolysis is from sepsis. Monitoring vital signs closely and noticing changes in respiratory, kidney, and gastrointestinal function may quickly detect the beginning of an infection. Strict asepsis is always maintained during routine skin care measures. Hand hygiene and wearing sterile gloves when carrying out procedures are essential. Visitors should wear protective garments and wash their hands before and after coming into contact with the patient. People with any infections or infectious disease should not visit the patient until they are no longer a danger to the patient. The nurse is critical in identifying early signs and symptoms of infection and notifying the primary provider. Antibiotic agents are not generally begun until there are signs and symptoms of an infection (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cohen et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Conjunctival Retraction, Scars, and Corneal Lesions.</span> The eyes are inspected daily for signs of pruritus, burning, and dryness, which may indicate progression to keratoconjunctivitis&#x2014;the principal eye complication. Applying a cool, damp cloth over the eyes may relieve burning sensations. The eyes are kept clean and observed for signs of discharge or discomfort, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1851" title="1851"></span>and the progression of symptoms is documented and reported. Administering an eye lubricant, when prescribed, may alleviate dryness and prevent corneal abrasion. Using eye patches or reminding the patient to blink periodically may also counteract dryness. The patient is instructed to avoid rubbing the eyes or putting any medication into the eyes that has not been prescribed or recommended by the primary provider.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome with involvement of large areas of the skin require care that is similar to that of patients with thermal burns. As the patient completes the acute inpatient stage of illness, the focus is directed toward rehabilitation and outpatient care or care in a rehabilitation center. The patient and family members are involved throughout this care and are instructed in the procedures, such as wound care and dressing changes, that will continue at home. The patient and family members are assisted in acquiring dressing supplies that will be needed at home.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient and family members are also provided with education about pain management; nutrition; measures to increase mobility; and prevention of complications, including prevention of infection. They are educated about the signs and symptoms of complications and instructed when to notify the health care provider. Written instructions are provided to the patient and family so that they can refer to this information when necessary (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4090">Trommel, Hofland, van Komen, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Interdisciplinary follow-up care is imperative to ensure that the patient&#x2019;s progress continues. Some patients will require care in a rehabilitation center before returning home. Others will require outpatient physical and occupational therapy for an extended period. When the patient returns home, the home health nurse coordinates the care provided by the various members of the health care team (e.g., physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, dietician). The nurse also monitors the patient&#x2019;s progress, provides ongoing assessment to identify complications, and monitors the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the plan of care. The patient&#x2019;s adaptation to the home care environment and the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s needs for support and assistance are also assessed. Referrals to community agencies are made as appropriate (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4090">Trommel et al., 2019</a>).</p>
