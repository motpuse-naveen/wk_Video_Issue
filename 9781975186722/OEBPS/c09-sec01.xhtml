<h5 class="h5" id="s176">Definition of Pain</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The American Pain Society (APS, 2016) defines <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pain:&lt;/b&gt; an unpleasant experience that is either emotional or sensory resulting from actual or possible damage to tissues and is uniquely experienced and described by each person">pain</button></strong> as &#x201C;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage&#x201D; (p. 2). This definition describes pain as a complex phenomenon that can impact a person&#x2019;s psychosocial, emotional, and physical functioning. The clinical definition of pain reinforces that pain is a highly personal and subjective experience: &#x201C;Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever he says it does&#x201D; (McCaffery, 1968, p. 8). The self-report by the patient is the standard; it is considered to be the most reliable indicator of pain and the most essential component of pain assessment (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib615">DiMaggio, Clark, Czarenecki, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s177">Effects of Pain</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain affects individuals of every age, gender, race, and socioeconomic class (APS, 2016). It is the primary reason people seek health care and one of the most common conditions that nurses treat (U.S. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services [HHS], 2019). Unrelieved pain has the potential to affect every system in the body and cause numerous harmful effects, some of which may last a lifetime (<a href="#tt9-1">Table&#x00A0;9-1</a>). Despite many advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pain and the availability of improved analgesic agents and technology, as well as nonpharmacologic pain management methods, all types of pain continue to be undertreated (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib687">Jungquist, Vallerand, Sicoutris, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s178">Types and Categories of Pain</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain can be categorized in many ways, and clear distinctions are not always possible. Pain often is described from the perspective of duration, as being acute or chronic (persistent) (APS, 2016). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;acute pain:&lt;/b&gt; pain that results from tissue damage that generally abates as healing occurs; serves as a warning signal that something is wrong or needs attention">Acute pain</button></strong> involves tissue damage as a result of surgery, trauma, burn, or venipuncture, and is expected to have a relatively short duration and resolve with normal healing. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chronic or persistent pain:&lt;/b&gt; pain that may or may not be time limited but that persists beyond the usual course/time of tissue healing">Chronic or persistent pain</button></strong> is subcategorized as being of cancer or noncancer origin and can persist throughout the course of a person&#x2019;s life. Examples of noncancer chronic pain include peripheral neuropathy from diabetes, back or neck pain after injury, and osteoarthritis pain from joint degeneration. Chronic pain may be intermittent, occurring with flares, or it may be continuous. Some conditions can produce both acute and chronic pain. For example, some patients with cancer have continuous chronic pain and also experience more intense acute exacerbations of pain periodically, which is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;breakthrough pain:&lt;/b&gt; a transitory increase in pain that occurs in the context of otherwise controlled persistent pain">breakthrough pain</button></strong> (BTP). Patients may also endure acute pain from repetitive painful procedures during cancer treatment (APS, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Pain is also classified by its inferred pathology as being either nociceptive pain or neuropathic pain (<a href="#tt9-2">Table&#x00A0;9-2</a>). <strong>Nociceptive (physiologic) pain</strong> refers to the normal functioning of physiologic systems that leads to the perception of noxious stimuli (tissue injury) as being painful (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib684">International Association for the Study of Pain [IASP], 2017</a>). This is the reason why nociception is described as &#x201C;normal&#x201D; pain transmission. <strong>Neuropathic (pathophysiologic) pain</strong> is pathologic and results from abnormal processing of sensory input by the nervous system as a result of damage to the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS) or both (IASP, 2017).</p>

<p class="indent">Patients may have a combination of nociceptive and neuropathic pain. For example, a patient may have nociceptive pain as a result of tumor growth, and also report radiating sharp and shooting neuropathic pain if the tumor is pressing against a nerve plexus. Sickle cell disease pain is usually a combination of nociceptive pain from the various hematologic changes of sickled cells as well as neuropathic pain from nerve ischemia (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Belvis, Henderson, &#x0026; Benzon, 2018</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Transduction</p>
<p class="nonindent">Transduction refers to the processes by which noxious stimuli, such as a surgical incision or burn, activate primary afferent neurons called <strong>nociceptors</strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, located throughout the body in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and visceral (organ), and somatic (musculoskeletal) structures (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib628">Montgomery, Mallick-Searle, Peltier, et al., 2018</a>). These neurons have the ability to respond selectively to noxious stimuli generated as a result of tissue damage from mechanical (e.g., incision, tumor growth), thermal (e.g., burn, frostbite), chemical (e.g., toxins, chemotherapy), and infectious sources. Noxious stimuli cause the release of a number of excitatory compounds (e.g., serotonin, bradykinin, histamine, substance P, and prostaglandins), which move pain along the pain pathway (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ringkamp, Dougherty, &#x0026; Raja, 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>A). In addition, sodium, calcium, and potassium ion channels are stimulated to open, resulting in electrical impulses that are transmitted through the large, rapid conducting A-delta and smaller, peripheral C-fiber nociceptors (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ellison, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that initiate inflammatory responses that increase tissue swelling and pain at the site of injury (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Baral, Udit, &#x0026; Chiu, 2019</a>). They form when the enzyme phospholipase breaks down phospholipids into arachidonic acid. In turn, the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (COX) acts on arachidonic acid to produce prostaglandins (<a href="#ff9-2">Fig.&#x00A0;9-2</a>). COX-1 and COX-2 are isoenzymes of COX and play an important role in producing the effects of the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nonopioid:&lt;/b&gt; refers to analgesic medications that include acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)">nonopioid</button></strong> analgesic agents, which include the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<strong>NSAIDs</strong>) and acetaminophen. NSAIDs produce pain relief by mediating inflammation at the site of trauma, primarily by blocking the formation of prostaglandins (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib692">Leppert, Malec-Milewska, Zajaczkowska, et al., 2018</a>). The nonselective NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and ketorolac, inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, and the COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such as celecoxib, inhibit only COX-2. As <a href="#ff9-2">Figure&#x00A0;9-2</a> illustrates, both types of NSAIDs produce anti-inflammation and pain relief through the inhibition of COX-2. Acetaminophen is known to be a COX inhibitor that has minimal peripheral effect, is not anti-inflammatory, and can both relieve pain and reduce fever by preventing the formation of prostaglandins in the CNS (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Slattery &#x0026; Klegeris, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Other analgesic agents work at the site of transduction by affecting the flux of ions. For example, sodium channels are closed and inactive at rest but undergo changes in response to nerve membrane depolarization. Transient channel opening leads to an influx of sodium that results in nerve conduction (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib630">Nouri, Osuagwu, Boyette-Davis, et al., 2018</a>). Local anesthetics reduce nerve conduction by blocking sodium channels. The calcium channel blocking anticonvulsants that are used to treat neuropathic pain facilitate analgesia by reducing the flux of calcium ions and limiting glutamate, norepinephrine, and substance P release (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Peterson, Benson, &#x0026; Hurley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Transmission</p>
<p class="nonindent">Transmission is another process involved in nociception. Effective transduction generates an action potential that is transmitted along the lightly myelinated rapid conducting A-delta fibers and the unmyelinated slower impulse conducting C fibers (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ellison, 2017</a>) (see <a href="#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>B). The endings of A-delta fibers detect thermal and mechanical injury, allow relatively quick localization of pain, and are responsible for a rapid reflex withdrawal from the painful stimulus. Unmyelinated C fibers respond to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. They produce poorly localized and often aching or burning pain. A-beta (&#x03B2;) fibers are the largest of the fibers and respond to touch, movement, and vibration but do not normally transmit pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ellison, 2017</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Vardeh &#x0026; Naranjo, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The action potential impulse with the noxious information passes through the dorsal root ganglia, then synapses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and then ascends up to the spinal cord and transmits the information to the brain, where pain is perceived (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ellison, 2017</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ringkamp et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>B). Extensive modulation occurs in the dorsal horn via complex neurochemical mechanisms (see <a href="#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>B inset). The primary A-delta fibers release glutamate and C fibers release substance P and other neuropeptides (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Schliessbach &#x0026; Maurer, 2017</a>). Glutamate is a key neurotransmitter because it binds to the <em>N</em>-methyl-<em>D</em>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and promotes pain transmission (Zhou, 2017).</p>
<p class="h7">Perception</p>
<p class="nonindent">An additional process involved in nociception is perception, which is the result of the neural activity associated with transmission of noxious stimuli (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Ringkamp et al., 2018</a>). It requires activation of higher brain structures for the occurrence of awareness, emotions, and impulses associated with pain (see <a href="#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>C). Although the physiology of pain perception continues to be studied, it can be targeted by nonpharmacologic therapies, such as distraction, which are based on the belief that innate brain processes can strongly influence pain perception (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Chayadi &#x0026; McConnell, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Modulation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Modulation is another process involved in nociception. Modulation of the information generated in response to noxious stimuli occurs at every level from the periphery to the cortex and involves many different neurochemicals (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib664">Damien, Colloca, Bellei-Rodriguez, et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ff9-1">Fig.&#x00A0;9-1</a>D). For example, serotonin and norepinephrine are inhibitory neurotransmitters that are released in the spinal cord and the brain stem by the descending (efferent) fibers of the modulatory system (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Nouri et al., 2018</a>). Some antidepressants provide pain relief by blocking the body&#x2019;s reuptake (resorption) of serotonin and norepinephrine, extending their availability to fight pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Martin et al., 2017</a>). Endogenous opioids are located throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems, and like exogenous opioids, they bind to opioid receptors in the descending system and inhibit pain transmission (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Nouri et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neuropathic Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Neuropathic pain is caused by either a lesion or a disease involving the somatosensory nervous system (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Bouhassira, 2019</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page202" title="202"></span>Injuries to peripheral nerves can either be traumatic or nontraumatic, such as diabetic or compression neuropathies (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Osborne, Anastakis, &#x0026; Davis, 2018</a>). Although specific causes may vary based on the underlying pathology, it is theorized that there are changes in the ion channels; imbalance of the stimuli processing between excitatory and inhibitory somatosensory signals; activity of glial cells; or potential differences in modulation of pain that occur with neuropathic pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib661">Colloca, Ludman, Bouhassira, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib694">Liu, Zhu, Ju, et al., 2019</a>) (<a href="#ff9-3">Fig.&#x00A0;9-3</a>). Recent research findings suggest that dysfunction in autophagy (i.e., cellular degradation of unnecessary materials) is involved with neuropathic pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Liu et al., 2019</a>). Research is ongoing to better define the peripheral and central mechanisms that initiate and maintain neuropathic pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib672">Garc&#x00ED;a, Guti&#x00E9;rrez-Lara, Centuri&#x00F3;n, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Kwiatkowski &#x0026; Mika, 2018</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Liu et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib705">Nishimura, Kawasaki, Suzuki, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Peripheral Mechanisms</p>
<p class="nonindent">At any point from the periphery to the CNS, the potential exists for the development of neuropathic pain. Nerve endings in the periphery can become damaged, leading to abnormal reorganization in the nervous system called maladaptive <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neuroplasticity:&lt;/b&gt; the ability of the peripheral and central nervous systems to change both structure and function as a result of noxious stimuli">neuroplasticity</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, an underlying mechanism of some neuropathic pain states (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Osborne et al., 2018</a>). Changes in ion channels can occur, such as increased sodium channel activity in sensory nerves resulting in heightened excitability, increased transduction, and release of neurotransmitters (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Colloca et al., 2017</a>). These and many other processes lead to a phenomenon called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;peripheral sensitization:&lt;/b&gt; a key peripheral mechanism of neuropathic pain that occurs when there are changes in the number and location of ion channels; in particular, sodium channels abnormally accumulate in injured nociceptors, producing a lower nerve depolarization threshold, ectopic discharges, and an increase in the response to stimuli">peripheral sensitization</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, which is thought to contribute to the maintenance of neuropathic pain and is thought to be reflected in allodynia and hyperalgesia (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Osborne et al., 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;allodynia:&lt;/b&gt; pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain, such as touch; typically experienced in the skin around areas affected by nerve injury and commonly seen with many neuropathic pain syndromes">Allodynia</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, or pain from a normally non-noxious stimulus (e.g., touch), is one such type of abnormal sensation and a common feature of neuropathic pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Chekka &#x0026; Benzon, 2018</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Osborne et al., 2018</a>). In patients with allodynia, the mere weight of clothing or bedsheets on the skin can be excruciatingly painful. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hyperalgesia:&lt;/b&gt; an increasingly intense experience of pain resulting from a noxious stimulus">Hyperalgesia</button></strong> is an increased response of pain sensation from a stimulus which at a usual pain threshold produces a less intense pain response.</p>
<p class="h7">Central Mechanisms</p>
<p class="nonindent">Central mechanisms also play a role in the establishment of neuropathic pain. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;central sensitization:&lt;/b&gt; a key central mechanism of neuropathic pain; the abnormal hyperexcitability of central neurons in the spinal cord, which results from complex changes induced by the incoming afferent barrages of nociceptors and results in an increased nociceptive neuron response">Central sensitization</button></strong> is defined as abnormal hyperexcitability of central neurons in the spinal cord, which results from complex changes induced by incoming afferent barrages of nociceptors, which also can result in allodynia and hyperalgesia (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Osborne et al., 2018</a>). Extensive release and binding of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, activate the NMDA receptor and cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels into the neuron, resulting in pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib726">Yan, Li, Zhou, et al., 2017</a>). Similar to what happens in the peripheral nervous system, an increase in the influx of sodium is thought to lower the threshold for nerve activation, increase response to stimuli, and enlarge the receptive field served by the affected neuron (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Osborne et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Yan et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As in the peripheral nervous system, anatomic changes can occur in the CNS. For example, when the NMDA receptor cells are continuously activated, reorganization in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord can occur (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Nouri et al., 2018</a>). Nerve fibers can invade other locations and create abnormal sensations, such as allodynia, in the area of the body served by the injured nerve.</p>
