<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">acute coronary syndrome (ACS):</span> signs and symptoms that indicate unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">angina pectoris:</span> chest pain brought about by myocardial ischemia</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">atheroma:</span> fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells that forms over lipid deposits within arterial vessels and protrudes into the lumen of the vessel, narrowing the lumen and obstructing blood flow; also called <em>plaque</em></p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">atherosclerosis:</span> abnormal accumulation of lipid deposits and fibrous tissue within arterial walls and the lumen</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">contractility:</span> ability of the cardiac muscle to shorten in response to an electrical impulse</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">coronary artery bypass graft (CABG):</span> a surgical procedure in which a blood vessel from another part of the body is grafted onto the occluded coronary artery below the occlusion in such a way that blood flow bypasses the blockage</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">high-density lipoprotein (HDL):</span> a protein-bound lipid that transports cholesterol to the liver for excretion in the bile; composed of a higher proportion of protein to lipid than low-density lipoprotein; exerts a beneficial effect on the arterial wall</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">ischemia:</span> insufficient tissue oxygenation</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">low-density lipoprotein (LDL):</span> a protein-bound lipid that transports cholesterol to tissues in the body; composed of a lower proportion of protein to lipid than high-density lipoprotein; exerts a harmful effect on the arterial wall</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">metabolic syndrome:</span> a cluster of metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">myocardial infarction (MI):</span> death of heart tissue caused by lack of oxygenated blood flow</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI):</span> a procedure in which a catheter is placed in a coronary artery, and one of several methods is employed to reduce blockage within the artery</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA):</span> a type of percutaneous coronary intervention in which a balloon is inflated within a coronary artery to break an atheroma and open the vessel lumen, improving coronary artery blood flow</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">stent:</span> a metal mesh that provides structural support to a coronary vessel, preventing its closure</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">sudden cardiac death:</span> abrupt cessation of effective heart activity</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">thrombolytic:</span> a pharmacologic agent that breaks down blood clots; alternatively referred to as a fibrinolytic</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">troponin:</span> a cardiac muscle biomarker; measurement is used as an indicator of heart muscle injury</p>

<p class="nonindent">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women of all racial and ethnic groups (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1749">Arnett, Blumenthal, Albert, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Research related to the identification of and treatment for cardiovascular disease includes all segments of the population affected by cardiac conditions, including women, children, and people of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. The results of ongoing research are used by nurses to identify specific prevention and treatment strategies in these populations.</p>
