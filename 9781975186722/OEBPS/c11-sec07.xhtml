<h4 class="h4" id="s362">Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome</h4>
<p class="nonindent">MODS is altered organ function in acutely ill patients that requires medical intervention to support continued organ function. It is another phase in the progression of shock states. The actual incidence of MODS is difficult to determine, because it develops with acute illnesses that compromise tissue perfusion. Dysfunction of one organ system is associated with 20% mortality, and if more than four organs fail, the mortality is at least 60% (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Sauaia, Moore, &#x0026; Moore, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s363">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The precise mechanism by which MODS occurs remains unknown, but it is most commonly seen in patients with sepsis as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion. MODS frequently occurs toward the end of the continuum of septic shock when tissue perfusion cannot be effectively restored. It is not possible to predict which patients who experience shock will develop MODS, partly because much of the organ damage occurs at the cellular level and, therefore, cannot be directly observed or measured.</p>
<p class="indent">The clinical presentation of MODS is insidious; tissues become hypoperfused at both a microcellular and macrocellular level, eventually causing organ dysfunction that requires mechanical and pharmacologic intervention to support organ function. Organ failure usually begins in the lungs, and cardiovascular instability, as well as failure of the hepatic, GI, renal, immunologic, and central nervous systems, follows (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Sauaia et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s364">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">While it is not possible to predict MODS, clinical severity assessment tools may be used to anticipate patient risk of organ dysfunction and mortality. These clinical assessment tools include APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation); SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score); PIRO (Predisposing factors, the Infection, the host Response, and Organ dysfunction); and SOFA score (see <a href="c11-sec06.xhtml#tt11-4">Table&#x00A0;11-4</a>) (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib868">Gustot, 2011</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Kress &#x0026; Hall, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In MODS, the sequence of organ dysfunction varies depending on the patient&#x2019;s primary illness and comorbidities before experiencing shock. Advanced age, malnutrition, and coexisting disease appear to increase the risk of MODS in acutely ill patients. For simplicity of presentation, the classic pattern is described. Typically, the lungs are the first organs to show signs of dysfunction. The patient experiences progressive dyspnea and respiratory failure that are manifested as ALI or ARDS, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapters 19</a>). The patient usually remains hemodynamically stable but may require increasing amounts of IV fluids and vasoactive agents to support BP and cardiac output. Signs of a hypermetabolic state, characterized by hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose level), hyperlactic acidemia (excess lactic acid in the blood), and increased BUN, are present. The metabolic rate may be 1.5 to 2 times the basal metabolic rate. At this time, there is a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass (autocatabolism) to meet the high energy demands of the body.</p>
<p class="indent">After approximately 7 to 10 days, signs of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., elevated bilirubin and liver function tests) and renal dysfunction (e.g., elevated creatinine and anuria) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page298" title="298"></span>are evident. As the lack of tissue perfusion continues, the hematologic system becomes dysfunctional, with worsening immunocompromise, increasing the risk of bleeding. The cardiovascular system becomes unstable and unresponsive to vasoactive agents, and the patient&#x2019;s neurologic response progresses to a state of unresponsiveness or coma.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of all shock states is to reverse the tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. If effective tissue perfusion is restored before organs become dysfunctional, the patient&#x2019;s condition stabilizes. Along the septic shock continuum, the onset of organ dysfunction is an ominous prognostic sign; the more organs that fail, the worse the outcome.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s365"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention remains the top priority in managing MODS. Older adult patients are at increased risk for MODS because of the lack of physiologic reserve and the natural degenerative process, especially immune compromise (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Kress &#x0026; Hall, 2018</a>). Early detection and documentation of initial signs of infection are essential in managing MODS in older adult patients. Subtle changes in mentation and a gradual rise in temperature are early warning signs. Other patients at greater risk for MODS are those with chronic illness, malnutrition, immunosuppression, or surgical or traumatic wounds.</p>
<p class="indent">If preventive measures fail, treatment measures to reverse MODS are aimed at (1) controlling the initiating event, (2) promoting adequate organ perfusion, (3) providing nutritional support, and (4) maximizing patient comfort.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s366"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The general plan of nursing care for patients with MODS is the same as that for patients with shock. Primary nursing interventions are aimed at supporting the patient and monitoring organ perfusion until primary organ insults are halted. Providing information and support to family members is a critical role of the nurse. The health care team must address end-of-life decisions to ensure that supportive therapies are congruent with the patient&#x2019;s wishes (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Communication</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses should encourage frequent and open communication about treatment modalities and options to ensure that the patient&#x2019;s wishes regarding medical management are met. Patients who survive MODS must be informed about the goals of rehabilitation and expectations for progress toward these goals, because massive loss of skeletal muscle mass makes rehabilitation a long, slow process. A strong nurse&#x2013;patient relationship built on effective communication provides needed encouragement during this phase of recovery.</p>
