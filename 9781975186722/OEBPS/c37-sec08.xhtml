<h4 class="h4" id="s1538">Fractures of Specific Sites</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Common sites of fractures include the clavicle, humeral neck, humeral shaft, elbow, proximal radius, radial and ulnar shafts, wrist, hand, pelvis, acetabulum, hips, femoral shaft, tibia and fibula, ribs, and thoracolumbar spine.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1539">Clavicle</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fracture of the clavicle (collar bone) is a common injury that can result from a fall or a direct blow to the shoulder. The clavicle helps maintain the shoulder in the upward, outward, and backward position from the thorax. Therefore, when the clavicle is fractured, the patient assumes a protective position, slumping the shoulders and immobilizing the arm to prevent shoulder movements. The treatment goal is to align the shoulder in its normal position by means of closed reduction and immobilization. Surgical intervention is not typical but may be indicated if the fracture is located in the distal third of the clavicle or is severely displaced, which may result in neurovascular compromise or pneumothorax (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kleinhenz, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of clavicle fractures occur in the middle third of the clavicle; clinical union (healing) takes 6 to 12 weeks in adults (Eiff, Hatch, &#x0026; Higgins, 2020b). A clavicular strap, also called a <em>figure-eight bandage</em> (see <a href="#ff37-13">Fig. 37-13</a>), may be used <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1179" title="1179"></span>to pull the shoulders back, reducing and immobilizing the fracture. The nurse monitors the circulation and nerve function of the affected arm and compares it with the unaffected arm to determine variations, which may indicate disturbances in neurovascular status. A sling may be used to support the arm and relieve pain. The patient may be permitted to use the arm for light activities as pain allows (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Hatch, Clugston, &#x0026; Taffee, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Fracture of the distal third of the clavicle, without displacement and ligament disruption, is treated with a sling and restricted motion of the arm. When a fracture in the distal third is accompanied by a disruption of the coracoclavicular ligament that connects the coracoid process of the scapula and the inferior surface of the clavicle, the bony fragments are frequently displaced. This type of injury may be treated surgically by ORIF.</p>
<p class="indent">Immobilization of the shoulder in the figure-eight bandage or arm sling should be continued until clinical union occurs (e.g., the fracture site is nontender and the patient can move the arm with little or no discomfort) (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Hatch et al., 2019</a>). The nurse cautions the patient not to elevate the arm above shoulder level until the fracture has healed but encourages the patient to exercise the elbow, wrist, and fingers as soon as possible. When prescribed, shoulder exercises are performed to obtain full shoulder motion (see <a href="#ff37-14">Fig. 37-14</a>). Contact sports or activities with potential for falling should be avoided for 1 to 2 months after healing is complete, and has been confirmed by clinical assessment and x-ray findings (Eiff et al., 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications of clavicular fractures are uncommon but can include neurovascular injuries (brachial plexus injury, subclavian vein or artery injury from a bony fragment, and thoracic outlet syndrome), pneumothorax, malunion, and nonunion (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Hatch et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1540">Humeral Neck</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the proximal humerus may occur through the neck of the humerus and are most often the result from a fall onto an outstretched hand. Most proximal humerus fractures occur in those older than 60 years of age and are more common in older women because of their greater risk of low bone density (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dorsey, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient presents with moderate to severe shoulder pain with the affected arm hanging limp at the side or supported by the uninjured hand. Neurovascular assessment of the extremity is essential to evaluate the full extent of injury and the possible involvement of the nerves and blood vessels of the arm.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of proximal humerus fractures are impacted with little to no displacement and do not require surgical reduction. The arm is supported and immobilized by a sling and swathe splint that secures the supported arm to the trunk (see <a href="#ff37-15">Fig. 37-15</a>). Limitation of motion and stiffness of the shoulder occur with disuse. Therefore, pendulum exercises begin as soon as tolerated by the patient. In pendulum or circumduction exercises, the physical therapist instructs the patient to lean forward and allow the affected arm to hang in abduction and rotate. These fractures heal rapidly in about 6 to 10 weeks due to the large areas of cancellous bone (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dorsey, 2020</a>). The goal of treatment is to restore as much function as possible; therefore, shoulder rehabilitation should begin as pain allows. Residual stiffness, aching, and some loss of shoulder motion (&#x201C;frozen shoulder&#x201D;) and function may persist and is more likely to develop in patients who do not perform ROM exercises regularly during recovery (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Bassett, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When a humeral neck fracture is significantly displaced, treatment consists of closed reduction with splinting, ORIF, hemiarthroplasty, and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Exercises begin after an adequate period of immobilization (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Bassett, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1541">Humeral Shaft</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the midshaft of the humerus are most frequently caused by either a direct blow or trauma that results in a transverse, oblique, or comminuted fracture, or an indirect twisting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1180" title="1180"></span>force that results in a spiral fracture. Patients usually present with considerable swelling and severe arm pain in the area of the mid-arm but may have referred pain to the shoulder or the elbow; shortening of the upper arm may indicate significant displacement (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dorsey, 2020</a>). A thorough neurovascular assessment is important as injury to the radial nerve is often present and may require immediate attention.</p>
<p class="indent">There are absolute indications for emergent surgical exploration such as open fractures and fractures associated with neurovascular injuries (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dorsey, 2020</a>). External fixators are used to treat open fractures of the humeral shaft. ORIF is necessary with nerve injury, blood vessel damage, or comminuted or displaced fractures (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Bassett, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">However, most humeral midshaft fractures can be treated nonsurgically. Initial splinting is commonly done with a coaptation (<em>sugar tong</em>) splint. (A sugar tong splint is a U-shaped splint that looks like tongs used for sugar cubes.) The splint is placed around the medial and lateral arm to the elbow and up to the top of the shoulder. The splint supports the arm in 90&#x00A0;degrees of flexion at the elbow; a sling or collar and cuff support the forearm. The weight of the hanging arm and splints put traction on the fracture site.</p>
<p class="indent">The preferred definitive treatment for a humerus shaft fracture is functional bracing. A contoured thermoplastic sleeve is secured in place with interlocking fabric (Velcro) closures around the upper arm, immobilizing the reduced fracture. As swelling decreases, the sleeve is tightened, and uniform pressure and stability are applied to the fracture. The forearm is supported with a collar and cuff sling (see <a href="#ff37-16">Fig. 37-16</a>). Functional bracing allows active use of muscles, shoulder and elbow motion, and good approximation of fracture fragments. Pendulum shoulder exercises are performed as prescribed to provide active movement of the shoulder, thereby preventing a &#x201C;frozen shoulder.&#x201D; Isometric exercises may be prescribed to prevent muscle atrophy. The callus that develops is substantial, and the sleeve can be discontinued in about 8 weeks. Complications that are seen with humeral shaft fractures include neurovascular compromise and nonunion because of decreased blood supply in that area.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1542">Elbow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">About 30% of adult elbow fractures involve the distal part of the humerus (Eiff, Hatch, &#x0026; Higgins, 2020c) and are classified as supracondylar, single column (condyle), bicolumn and coronal shear fractures. Most fractures result from high-energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle crashes, falls directly on the elbow (in the extended or flexed position), or a direct blow. These fractures can be very painful and may result in injury to the brachial artery and median nerves (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Yian, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A comprehensive examination of the neurovascular status of the affected extremity should be conducted. The patient is evaluated for paresthesia and signs of compromised circulation in the forearm and hand. The most serious complication of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus is Volkmann ischemia contracture (an acute compartment syndrome), which results from antecubital swelling or damage to the brachial artery and leads to contracture (shortening) of the forearm muscles. This more commonly occurs in children than in adults and will result in a &#x201C;clawlike&#x201D; appearance to the hand and wrist. The nurse needs to monitor the patient regularly for compromised neurovascular status with the &#x201C;5 Ps&#x201D;; marked swelling and induration of the forearm are other signs (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kare, 2019</a>). Emergency fasciotomy with d&#x00E9;bridement of the muscle may be necessary to prevent progression to Volkmann contracture (Eiff et al., 2020c). Other potential complications are damage to the joint articular surfaces and hemarthrosis (e.g., blood in the joint), which may be treated by needle aspiration by the primary provider to relieve the pressure and pain.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of therapy is prompt reduction and stabilization of the distal humeral fracture, followed by controlled active motion after swelling has subsided and healing has begun. If the fracture is not displaced, the arm is immobilized in a posterior splint for 2 to 3 weeks. At that point, ROM exercises can begin with the use of a hinged functional brace (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Yian, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Usually, a displaced fracture is treated with ORIF. Excision of bone fragments may be necessary. Additional external support with a splint is then applied. Active finger exercises are encouraged. Gentle ROM exercise of the injured joint is begun early. Motion promotes healing of injured joints by producing movement of synovial fluid into the articular cartilage. Active exercise to prevent residual limitation of motion is performed as prescribed. Total elbow arthroplasty may be indicated in the presence of significant comminution (e.g., fragmentation of bone). Pain management is achieved through the use of NSAIDs or opioid medications (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Yian, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1543">Proximal Radius</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Radial head and neck fractures are fractures of the proximal radius. They are common and are usually the result of a fall on an outstretched hand with the elbow extended. The patient presents with localized swelling over the lateral elbow, tenderness, and decreased motion; pain increases with passive rotation. If blood has collected in the elbow joint, it is aspirated to relieve pain and to allow early active elbow and forearm ROM exercises (Eiff et al., 2020c). Nondisplaced <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1181" title="1181"></span>fractures are typically managed nonsurgically with a sling for comfort; elbow flexion and extension as tolerated out of the sling should begin as soon as tolerated, usually within the first few days after injury (Eiff et al., 2020c). If the fracture is displaced, surgery is typically indicated, with excision of or replacement of the radial head when necessary (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Rabin, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1544">Radial and Ulnar Shafts</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the distal radius are among the most common fractures and occur more frequently in children and adolescents but can occur in adults. The radius or the ulna may be fractured at any level. Frequently, displacement occurs when both bones are broken. The forearm serves an integral role in upper extremity function; therefore, the unique functions of pronation and supination must be preserved with proper anatomic alignment (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kakarala &#x0026; Simons, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In adults, if the fragments are not displaced, the fracture is treated by closed reduction with immobilization in a bivalved long arm cast with the wrist in slight extension, the forearm in neutral rotation, and the elbow at 90 degrees (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Michaudet, 2020</a>). Circulation, motion, and sensation of the hand are assessed before and after the cast is applied. The arm is elevated to control edema. Frequent finger flexion and extension are encouraged to reduce edema. Active motion of the involved shoulder is essential. The reduction and alignment are monitored closely by x-rays at weekly intervals for the first 4 weeks to ensure proper alignment and then every 2 weeks until healing has occurred (usually 12 to 16 weeks). During the last 6 weeks, the arm may be in a functional forearm brace that allows exercise of the wrist and elbow. Lifting and twisting are avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">Displaced fractures of the radius and ulna require an ORIF, using a compression plate with screws, intramedullary nails, or rods. The arm is usually immobilized in a plaster splint or cast. Open and displaced fractures may be managed with external fixation devices. The arm is elevated to control swelling. Neurovascular status is assessed and documented. Elbow, wrist, and hand exercises are begun when prescribed by the primary provider.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1545">Wrist</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the distal radius (Colles fracture) are common and are usually the result of a fall on an open, outstretched hand, with the wrist in extension. This fracture is frequently seen in older adults with osteoporotic bones that do not dissipate the energy of the fall; it can also occur in youth who are involved in sports who sustain a high-energy fall. The patient presents with a deformed wrist, pain, swelling, weakness, and limited finger ROM, and possibly reports of &#x201C;tingling&#x201D; in the affected hand. Tingling sensation may indicate injury to the median nerve (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Nelson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment usually consists of closed reduction and immobilization with a sugar-tong splint until swelling resides. The splint is placed so that it extends from the palm around the elbow to the back of the hand just below the fingers. This splint should remain in place until the edema lessens and usually the splint is changed to a short arm cast in 2 to 3&#x00A0;weeks. For fractures with extensive comminution, ORIF, plating, percutaneous pinning, or external fixation is used to achieve and maintain reduction. Pain medication is given as prescribed to aid in pain control (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Petron, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="box11a"><p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct37-7"><strong>Chart 37-7 <img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Encouraging Exercise After Treatment for Wrist Fracture</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse encourages active motion of the fingers and shoulder. The patient is instructed to perform the following exercises to reduce swelling and prevent stiffness:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hold the hand at the level of the heart.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Move the fingers from full extension to flexion. Hold and release. Repeat at least 10 times every hour when awake.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use the hand in functional activities.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Actively exercise the shoulder and elbow, including complete range-of-motion exercises of both joints.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Active motion of the fingers and shoulder should begin promptly to reduce swelling and prevent stiffness (see Chart&#x00A0;37-7).</p>
<p class="indent">The fingers may swell due to diminished venous and lymphatic return. The nurse assesses the sensory function of the median nerve by pricking the distal aspect of the index finger. The motor function is assessed by the patient&#x2019;s ability to touch the thumb to the little finger. Diminished circulation and nerve function must be treated promptly (see previous discussion of acute compartment syndrome).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1546">Hand</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the bones of the hand, phalanges and metacarpals, are a common injury of the skeletal system and a frequent reason that patients seek care in EDs (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Muttath, Chung, &#x0026; Ono, 2019</a>). The most common type of metacarpal fracture in adults is referred to as boxer&#x2019;s fracture, which occurs when a closed fist bangs against a hard surface, fracturing the neck of the fifth finger. Falls and occupational injuries (e.g., machinery injuries, crushes) are the most common cause of phalangeal injury in adults (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Lakshmanan, Damodaran, &#x0026; Sher, 2018</a>). When any of the bones of the hand are fractured, the objectives of treatment are to regain maximum function of the hand and minimize cosmetic deformities. X-rays are the diagnostic studies of choice (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Muttath et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For a nondisplaced fracture of the phalanx (finger bone), the finger is splinted for 3 to 4 weeks to relieve pain and to protect the finger from further trauma. Splinting sometimes consists of &#x201C;buddy taping&#x201D; a fractured finger to an adjoining nonfractured finger. Serial x-rays may be done to monitor healing. Displaced fractures and open fractures may require ORIF, using wires or pins. If the fracture is open, or if a fingernail is avulsed, antibiotics may be prescribed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Basset, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The neurovascular status of the injured hand is evaluated and documented. Swelling is controlled by elevation of the hand. Functional use of the uninvolved portion of the hand is encouraged. Assistive devices might be recommended to aid the patient in performing ADLs until the hand has healed and functional status returns.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1547">Pelvis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The sacrum, ilium, pubis, and ischium bones form the bony pelvis, which unites to form an anatomic ring in adults (see <a href="#ff37-17">Fig. 37-17</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1182" title="1182"></span>Falls from a great height, motor vehicle and motorcycle crashes, vehicle versus pedestrian, and crush injuries can cause pelvic fractures. There is a high mortality rate associated with unstable pelvic fractures, second only to head injuries among trauma-related deaths; this is primarily related to hemorrhage, although pulmonary complications, fat emboli, thromboembolic complications, and infection are also implicated (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Fiechtl, 2018</a>). Management of severe, life-threatening pelvic fractures is coordinated with the trauma team.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff37-17">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff37-17.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff37-17.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;37-17 &#x2022;</span> Pelvic bones.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms of pelvic fracture may include ecchymosis; tenderness over the symphysis pubis, anterior iliac spines, iliac crest, sacrum, or coccyx; local edema; numbness or tingling of the pubis, genitals, and proximal thighs; inability to bear weight without discomfort; severe back pain (retroperitoneal bleed); alterations in neurovascular status of lower extremities (see later discussion of pedal pulse assessment); and clinical manifestations of shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). CT scanning of the pelvis helps determine the extent of injury by demonstrating sacroiliac joint disruption, soft tissue trauma, pelvic hematoma, and fractures. Neurovascular assessment of the lower extremities is completed to detect any injury to pelvic blood vessels and nerves. Assessment of underlying organs for injury is indicated especially in high-impact trauma (Eiff, Hatch, &#x0026; Higgins, 2020d). Trauma to the ureters, urethra, rectum, vagina; abdominal vascular trauma to veins (more common) and arteries; and neurologic trauma, particularly spinal column and cord injury, should be assessed as potential concomitant injuries (Eiff et al., 2020d). See <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a> for discussion of multi trauma and abdominal trauma.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemorrhage and shock are two of the most serious consequences that can occur. Bleeding arises mainly from the laceration of veins and arteries by bone fragments and possibly from a torn iliac artery. The peripheral pulses, especially the dorsalis pedis pulses of both lower extremities, are palpated; absence of a pulse may indicate a tear in the iliac artery or one of its branches. Abdominal CT may be performed to detect intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Excessive movement of the pelvis should be avoided, and the patient is handled gently so that bony fragments are not displaced, which may exacerbate bleeding and shock. Fluid replacement and analgesics are administered as needed. Exploratory laparotomy may be performed to further visualize the peritoneum (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Moore &#x0026; Doty, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of adjacent structures must be completed when pelvic injury is suspected.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous classification systems have been used to describe pelvic fractures in relation to anatomy, stability, and mechanism of injury. Some fractures of the pelvis do not disrupt the pelvic ring; others disrupt the ring, which may be rotationally or vertically unstable. The severity of pelvic fractures varies. Long-term complications of pelvic fractures include malunion, nonunion, DVTs, residual gait disturbances, back pain from ligament injury, and dyspareunia and erectile dysfunction (Eiff et al., 2020d).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Stable Pelvic Fractures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Stable fractures of the pelvis (see <a href="#ff37-18">Fig. 37-18</a>) include fracture of a single pubic or ischial ramus, fracture of ipsilateral pubic and ischial rami, fracture of the pelvic wing of the ilium (Duverney fracture), and fracture of the sacrum or coccyx. If injury results in only a slight widening of the pubic symphysis or the anterior sacroiliac joint and the pelvic ligaments are intact, the disrupted pubic symphysis is likely to heal spontaneously with conservative management. Most fractures of the pelvis heal rapidly because the pelvic bones are mostly cancellous bone, which has a rich blood supply.</p>
<p class="indent">Stable pelvic fractures can be treated with a few days of bed rest, analgesics, and progressive mobilization, depending on the level of patient discomfort, which can seriously hamper patient mobility. Fluids, dietary fiber, ankle and leg exercises, anti-embolism stockings to aid venous return, logrolling, deep breathing, early immobilization, and skin care reduce the risk of complications and increase the patient&#x2019;s comfort. The patient with a fractured sacrum is at risk for paralytic ileus; therefore, bowel sounds should be monitored.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with a fracture of the coccyx experiences pain when sitting and when defecating. A donut ring cushion, sitz baths, and stool softeners to ease defecation are beneficial adjuncts to ease pain. As pain resolves, activity is gradually resumed with the use of assistive mobility devices. Early mobilization reduces problems related to immobility (Eiff&#x00A0;et&#x00A0;al.,&#x00A0;2020d). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1183" title="1183"></span>Most patients should be managed with these conservative measures for at least 2 months until symptoms improve (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Foye, 2020</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Unstable Pelvic Fractures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Unstable fractures of the pelvis (see <a href="#ff37-19">Fig. 37-19</a>) may result in rotational instability (e.g., the &#x201C;open book&#x201D; type, in which a separation occurs at the symphysis pubis with sacroiliac ligament disruption), vertical instability, or a combination of both. Lateral or anteroposterior compression of the pelvis produces rotationally unstable pelvic fractures. Vertically unstable pelvic fractures occur when force is exerted on the pelvis vertically, as may occur when the patient falls onto extended legs or is struck from above by a falling object. Vertical shear pelvic fractures involve the anterior and posterior pelvic ring with vertical displacement, usually through the sacroiliac joint. There is generally complete disruption of the posterior sacroiliac, sacrospinous, and sacrotuberous ligaments.</p>
<p class="indent">Trauma to soft-tissue, urethral, skeletal, neurovascular, and/or neurologic structures that are contiguous with the pelvis may also occur in unstable pelvic fractures as a result of high-energy mechanisms of injury (e.g., motor vehicle or motorcycle crashes, motor vehicles striking pedestrians, falls from great heights) (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Russell &#x0026; Jarrett, 2020</a>). Immediate treatment in the ED for a patient with an unstable pelvic fracture includes stabilizing the pelvic bones and compressing bleeding vessels with a pelvic girdle, which is an external binding and stabilizing device. If major vessels are lacerated, the bleeding may be stopped through embolization using interventional radiology techniques prior to surgery. Because of the tremendous force necessary to cause an unstable pelvic fracture, hemorrhage and associated head injury are the most common causes of death within 24 hours post arrival to the hospital, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and sepsis resulting from infection are the main causes of death after that timeframe (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Moore &#x0026; Doty, 2017</a>). See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for nursing management of the patient in shock. When the patient is hemodynamically stable, treatment generally involves external fixation or ORIF. These measures promote hemostasis, hemodynamic stability, comfort, and early mobilization.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1548">Acetabulum</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acetabular fractures are a type of intra-articular fracture that require a very precise and delicate surgical reduction. The typical mechanism of injury is that an external force drives the femoral shaft into the hip joint, fracturing the acetabulum. This may be caused by high-speed motor vehicle crashes (e.g., knees driven into dashboard, pedals forcibly driven upward into legs) or from falls from heights (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Thacker, Tejwani, &#x0026; Thakkar, 2018</a>). Treatment depends on the pattern of fracture. Stable, nondisplaced fractures may be managed with traction and protective weight bearing so that the affected foot is placed on the floor only for balance. Displaced and unstable acetabular fractures are treated either with closed reduction and skeletal traction or ORIF (Eiff et al., 2020d). Internal fixation permits early non&#x2013;weight-bearing ambulation and ROM exercise. Complications seen with acetabular fractures include nerve damage, AVN, malunion, heterotopic ossification, and posttraumatic arthritis (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Thacker et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1549">Hip</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Annually, more than 300,000 adults older than 65 years of age sustain a hip fracture requiring hospitalization; 95% of these result from falls (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2798">United Health Foundation, 2019</a>). Hip fracture is a debilitating condition in older adults, particularly women (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Veronese &#x0026; Maggi, 2018</a>). As the U.S. population ages, the annual number of hip fractures is expected to increase. The costs of treatment are high, due to long periods of hospitalization and subsequent rehabilitation. Contributing factors for falls and resultant hip fracture include weak quadriceps muscles, slowed reflexes, osteoporosis, poor vision, diminished balance, general frailty due to age, and conditions that produce decreased cerebral arterial perfusion and cognitive impairment (e.g., transient ischemic attacks, anemia, thromboemboli, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these factors, many medications may cause orthostasis and instability in the older adult. In recognition of this, the American Geriatrics Society periodically publicizes an updated list of <em>Potentially Inappropriate Medications</em> (PIM) for Older Adults, and a tool to evaluate medication use for problems in older adults, called the <em>Beers Criteria.</em> Medications that can cause orthostasis and instability in older adults, particularly if they take multiple medications (i.e., polypharmacy) include antihypertensive agents, diuretics, beta-blockers, sedatives and hypnotics, neuroleptics and antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics, and NSAIDs (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2711">Fick, Semla, Steinman, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Ming &#x0026; Zecevic, 2018</a>).</p>

<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1183</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1184" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1184">p. 1184</span></div>
<p class="indent">Hip fractures are classified by anatomic location and fracture type. <em>Extracapsular fractures</em> (extending from the base of the femoral neck to the area just distal to the lesser trochanter) are fractures of the trochanteric, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric region. <em>Intracapsular fractures</em> are fractures of the femoral head and neck. Intrascapular fractures have a higher rate of nonunion or malunion and femoral neck fractures may damage the vascular system that supplies blood to the head and the neck of the femur, and the bone may become ischemic (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Foster, 2020</a>). For this reason, AVN is common in patients with femoral neck fractures (see <a href="#ff37-20">Fig. 37-20</a>). <em>Periprosthetic fractures</em> are fractures to the regions surrounding prosthetics joints which are increasing due to the growing number patients having previously had total joint replacements (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2693">Capone, Congia, Civinini, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1550">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a hip fracture will have pain over the outer thigh or in the groin and limited ROM. There will be significant discomfort with any attempt to flex or rotate the hip (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Bhatti &#x0026; Ertl, 2019</a>). With fractures of the femoral neck, the leg may be shortened, adducted, and externally rotated. With most fractures of the femoral neck, the patient cannot move the leg without a significant increase in pain. The patient is most comfortable with the leg slightly flexed in external rotation. Impacted intracapsular femoral neck fractures cause moderate discomfort (even with movement), may allow the patient to bear weight, and may not demonstrate obvious shortening or rotational changes. With extracapsular femoral fractures of the trochanteric or subtrochanteric region, the extremity is significantly shortened, externally rotated to a greater degree than intracapsular fractures, exhibits muscle spasm that resists positioning of the extremity in a neutral position, and has an associated area of ecchymosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by x-ray (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Morrison &#x0026; Siu, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1551"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">Populations at higher risk of hip fracture include older adults (particularly women) who have decreased bone density and muscle mass and those with chronic conditions (e.g., endocrine and intestinal disorders) that lead to weakened bones or who have cognitive impairment which increases the risk of falling (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2798">United Health Foundation, 2019</a>). Stress and immobility related to the trauma predispose the older adult to atelectasis, pneumonia, sepsis, VTE, pressure injuries, and reduced ability to cope with other health problems. Many older adults hospitalized with hip fractures are vulnerable for delirium as a result of stress of the trauma, pain, unfamiliar surroundings, sleep deprivation, and medications. In addition, delirium that develops in some older adult patients may be caused by mild cerebral ischemia or mild hypoxemia. Other factors associated with delirium include frailty, malnutrition, dehydration, infectious processes, mood disturbances, and blood loss. In older patients with hip fractures who have dementia, the same factors that may cause delirium may exacerbate their dementia, further complicating recovery and increasing the risk for adverse outcomes (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2766">Mosk, Mus, Vroemen, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To prevent complications, the nurse must assess the older patient for chronic conditions that require close monitoring. Examination of the legs may reveal edema due to heart failure or absence of peripheral pulses from peripheral vascular disease. Similarly, chronic respiratory problems may be present and may contribute to the possible development of atelectasis or pneumonia. Coughing and deep-breathing exercises are encouraged. Frequently, older adults take cardiac, antihypertensive, or respiratory medications that need to be continued. The patient&#x2019;s responses to these medications should be monitored.</p>
<p class="indent">Dehydration and poor nutrition may be present. At times, older adults who live alone cannot call for help at the time of injury. A day or two may pass before assistance is provided, and as a result, dehydration and debilitation occur. Nutritional status may have been poor prior to admission, so the nurse should monitor for complications of dehydration and malnutrition (e.g., pressure injuries, etc.). Screening for malnutrition and high-protein nutritional supplementation may be effective in improving outcomes in older adults with hip fractures and should be incorporated into the plan of care (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2746">Kramer, Blokhuis, Verdijk, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Muscle weakness may have initially contributed to the fall and fracture. Bed rest and immobility cause an additional loss of muscle strength unless the nurse encourages the patient to move all joints except the involved hip and knee. Patients are encouraged to use their arms and the overhead trapeze to reposition themselves. This strengthens the arms and shoulders, which facilitates walking with assistive devices.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1552">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is indicated for most patients with hip fracture. Nonoperative management may be considered in some older patients with advanced comorbidities or cognitive impairment; certain types of fractures may be sufficiently stable to benefit from nonoperative treatment (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Morrison &#x0026; Sui, 2019</a>). Buck&#x2019;s extension traction, a type of temporary skin traction, was traditionally applied because it was believed to reduce muscle spasm, to immobilize the extremity, and to relieve pain. However, skin traction is rarely used as a definitive therapy. It may be prescribed as a temporary measure until definitive therapy is achieved (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>; <a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Morrison &#x0026; Siu, 2019</a>). The goal of surgical treatment <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1185" title="1185"></span>for hip fractures is to obtain a satisfactory fixation so that the patient can be mobilized quickly and avoid secondary medical complications. Surgical treatment consists of open or closed reduction of the fracture and internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty (replacement of the femoral head with a prosthesis), or closed reduction with percutaneous stabilization for an intracapsular fracture. Surgical intervention is carried out as soon as possible after injury. The preoperative objective is to ensure that the patient is in as favorable a condition as possible for the surgery. Displaced femoral neck fractures are treated as emergencies, with reduction and internal fixation performed within 24 hours after fracture. The femoral head is often replaced with an orthopedic implant if there is complete disruption of blood flow to the femoral head, which may cause AVN (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Lu &#x0026; Uppal, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff37-21">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff37-21.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff37-21.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;37-21 &#x2022;</span> Examples of internal fixation for hip fractures. Internal fixation is achieved through the use of screws and plates specifically designed for stability and fixation.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">After general or spinal anesthesia, the hip fracture is reduced under fluoroscopic visualization. A stable fracture is usually fixed with nails, a nail and plate combination, multiple pins, or compression screw devices (see <a href="#ff37-21">Fig. 37-21</a>). The orthopedic surgeon determines the specific fixation device based on the fracture site or sites. Adequate reduction is important for fracture healing&#x2014;the better the reduction, the better the healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Total hip arthroplasty (i.e., replacement of both the femoral head and acetabulum) or hemiarthroplasty (i.e., replacement of only the femoral head) (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>) may be used in select patients with intracapsular fractures (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Lu &#x0026; Uppal, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1553">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The immediate postoperative care for a patient with a hip fracture is similar to that for other patients undergoing major surgery (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>). Attention is given to pain management, prevention of secondary medical problems, and early mobilization of the patient so that independent functioning can be restored.</p>
<p class="indent">During the first 24 to 48 hours, relief of pain and prevention of complications are important, and continuous neurovascular assessment is essential. The nurse encourages deep breathing and dorsiflexion and plantar flexion exercises every 1 to 2 hours. Thigh-high anti-embolism stockings or pneumatic compression devices are used, and anticoagulants are given as prescribed to prevent the formation of VTE. The nurse administers prescribed analgesic medications and monitors the patient&#x2019;s hydration, nutritional status, and urine output.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Repositioning the Patient</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most comfortable and safest way to turn the patient is to turn to the uninjured side. The standard method involves placing a pillow between the patient&#x2019;s legs to keep the affected leg in an abducted position. Proper alignment and supported abduction are maintained while turning (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2730">Hohler, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Exercise</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is encouraged to exercise as much as possible by means of the overbed trapeze. This device helps strengthen the arms and shoulders in preparation for protected ambulation (e.g., toe touch, partial weight bearing). On the first postoperative day, the patient transfers to a chair with assistance and begins assisted ambulation. The amount of weight bearing that can be permitted depends on the stability of the fracture reduction. The primary provider prescribes the degree of weight bearing. In general, hip flexion and internal rotation restrictions apply only if the patient has had a hemiarthroplasty or total arthroplasty (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kellam, 2020</a>) (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>). Physical therapists work with the patient on transfers, ambulation, and the safe use of assistive devices.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient can anticipate discharge to home or to an extended-care facility with the use of assistive devices (see <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). Some modifications in the home may be needed, such as installation of elevated toilet seats and grab bars.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Neurovascular complications may occur from direct injury or edema in the area that causes compression of nerves and blood vessels. With hip fracture, bleeding into the tissues and edema are expected. Monitoring and documenting the neurovascular status of the affected leg are vital.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1185</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1186" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1186">p. 1186</span></div>
<p class="indent">To prevent VTE, the nurse encourages intake of fluids and ankle and foot exercises. Anti-embolism stockings, pneumatic compression devices, and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy are indicated and should be prescribed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Forsh, 2019</a>). During hospitalization, the patient or the patient&#x2019;s caregiver should be educated regarding the signs, symptoms, and risks of VTE, and how to administer anticoagulant prophylaxis as prescribed. Intermittent assessment of the patient&#x2019;s legs for signs of DVT, which may include unilateral calf tenderness, warmth, redness, and swelling, is indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Pulmonary complications (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia) are a threat to older patients undergoing hip surgery. Coughing and deep-breathing exercises, intermittent changes of position, and the use of an incentive spirometer may help prevent respiratory complications. Pain must be treated with analgesic agents, typically opioids; otherwise, the patient may not be able to cough, deep breathe, or engage in prescribed activities. The nurse assesses breath sounds to detect adventitious or diminished sounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Skin breakdown is often seen in older patients with hip fracture. Blisters caused by tape are related to the tension of soft tissue edema under a nonelastic tape. An elastic hip wrap dressing or elastic tape applied in a vertical fashion may reduce the incidence of tape blisters. In addition, patients with hip fractures tend to remain in one position and may develop pressure injuries. Proper skin care, especially on the bony prominences, helps to relieve pressure. High-density foam mattress overlays may provide protection by distributing pressure evenly.</p>
<p class="indent">Loss of bladder control (incontinence or retention) may occur. If an indwelling catheter is inserted at the time of surgery, it usually is removed within 24 hours of surgery to avoid a hospital-acquired urinary tract infection (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Morrison &#x0026; Siu, 2020</a>). If the patient does not void within 6 hours of catheter removal and/or is expressing symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., abdominal fullness, discomfort), a bladder scan should be performed to determine the volume of urine; intermittent catheterization may be indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Delayed complications of hip fractures include infection, nonunion, and AVN of the femoral head (particularly with femoral neck fractures) (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Bhatti &#x0026; Ertl, 2019</a>). Infection is suspected if the patient complains of constant pain in the hip and has an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</p>
<p class="indent">The nursing management of the older adult patient with a hip fracture is summarized in the Plan of Nursing Care (see <a href="#ct37-8">Chart 37-8</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating the Patient About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients are discharged from the hospital to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The patient and family members or caregivers are assessed for their readiness to commence activities that promote healing and mobility. The nurse collaborates with other members of the multidisciplinary physiotherapy team (e.g., physical therapist, occupational therapist) to gather baseline data on the patient&#x2019;s anticipated long-term care environment post discharge, whether that is home or a long-term care facility, such as a skilled nursing facility. The patient begins a rehabilitation routine geared to meet the needs of this environment. For instance, if the patient is to be discharged home, and there are stairs in the home, then a goal of rehabilitation is that the patient will be able to get up and down stairs before discharge.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient engages in regular exercises to improve muscle tone and balance. The safe use of ambulatory aids, any specific activity restrictions (e.g., hip precautions if total hip arthroplasty was performed), and fall prevention measures (e.g., appropriate footwear, proper lighting, removal of throw rugs, getting rid of clutter) are also vitally important education topics that must be adequately addressed prior to discharge (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Walker &#x0026; Revell, 2019</a>). The patient and caregiver are educated on the indications for any newly prescribed medications, wound care, and the importance of proper nutrition. Identification of any potential complications (e.g., reddened wound, fever) and when and how to contact the patient&#x2019;s primary provider are also important to understand.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Referral for home, community-based, or transitional care is important to enable assessment of the patient&#x2019;s home environment and the adequacy of resources and support of caregivers. Home-based intensive physical therapy improves strength and gait for older adults with hip fractures; accommodations to the home may need to be made to ensure the patient&#x2019;s continuing care, safety, and mobility (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2730">Hohler, 2018</a>). During follow-up home health or outpatient clinic visits, the nurse reevaluates the patient&#x2019;s healing process and the continued adequacy of resources and support of caregivers. Based upon these findings, modifications may need to be made. For instance, an older adult spouse may require assistance or respite care. Home health agencies, local area agencies on aging (for older adult patients), and faith community nursing organizations, may be tapped into to provide assistance within the home or with transporting the patient to follow-up outpatient appointments.</p>
<p class="indent">Osteoporosis screening of patients who have experienced hip fracture is important for prevention of future fractures. With dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan testing, the risk of additional fracture can be predicted. Specific patient education regarding dietary requirements, lifestyle changes, and weight-bearing exercise to promote bone health is needed. Adequate dietary or supplemental vitamin D and calcium supplements are also recommended (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2697">Conley, Adib, Adler, et al., 2020</a>). Specific therapeutic interventions need to be initiated to slow bone loss and to build bone mineral density (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1554">Femoral Shaft</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The femur is the longest and strongest tubular bone in the body; it requires considerable force to break the shaft of a femur in adults. Most femoral fractures occur in young adults who have been involved in motor vehicle crashes or who have fallen from heights. Due to high-energy force, these patients frequently have associated multiple traumatic injuries (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Asplund &#x0026; Mezzanotte, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient presents with an edematous, deformed, painful thigh and cannot move the hip or the knee. The fracture may be transverse, oblique, spiral, or comminuted. Frequently, the patient develops shock, because the loss of 1 to 2.5 L of blood into the tissues is common with these fractures (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2659">Makhni, Makhni, Swartz, et al., 2017</a>). Types of femoral fractures are illustrated in <a href="#ff37-22">Figure 37-22</a>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1555">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment includes checking the neurovascular status of the extremity, especially circulatory perfusion of the lower leg and foot (popliteal, posterior tibial, and pedal pulses and toe capillary refill time), and comparing with the unaffected leg. A Doppler ultrasound may be indicated to assess blood flow. X-rays are used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Asplund &#x0026; Mezzanotte, 2019</a>). Dislocation of the hip and knee may accompany these fractures. Knee effusion suggests ligament damage and possible instability of the knee joint.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1556">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Continued neurovascular monitoring and documentation are important. The fracture is immobilized so that additional soft tissue damage does not occur. Generally, skeletal traction (see <a href="#ff37-22">Fig. 37-22</a>B,C) or splinting is used to reduce the fracture to anatomic alignment which helps reduce pain and prevent hematoma formation (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Keany &#x0026; McKeever, 2019</a>). IV opioid analgesic agents (e.g., morphine) are typically given to treat pain (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Asplund &#x0026; Mezzanotte, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Early fracture stabilization decreases morbidity and mortality; therefore, internal fixation usually is carried out as soon as the patient is physiologically stable. Intramedullary locking nail devices are typically used. Internal fixation permits early mobilization, which is associated with improved outcomes and recovery (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Keany &#x0026; McKeever, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Open femoral fractures require immediate and extensive irrigation and d&#x00E9;bridement in the operating suite (see previous discussion of treatment for open fractures). Tetanus toxoid (unless given within 5 years) and antibiotics with staphylococcal coverage and good tissue penetration are often administered. Depending on needs for continued d&#x00E9;bridement, intramedullary nailing may be delayed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Keany &#x0026; McKeever, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1191</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1192" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1192">p. 1192</span></div>
<p class="indent">Postoperatively, to preserve muscle strength, the patient is instructed to exercise the hip and the lower leg, foot, and toes on a regular basis. Active muscle movement enhances healing by increasing blood supply and electrical potentials at the fracture site. Prescribed weight-bearing limits are based on the type and location of the fracture and treatment approach. Physical therapy includes ROM and strengthening exercises, safe use of assistive devices, and gait training (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Makhni et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A common complication after fracture of the femoral shaft is restriction of knee motion. Active and passive knee exercises begin as soon as possible, depending on the stability of the fracture and knee ligaments. Other complications in the immediate postoperative period can include hemorrhage, acute compartment syndrome, and neurovascular compromise. Long-term complications may include malrotation, malunion, delayed union, and nonunion (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Keany &#x0026; McKeever, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1557">Tibia and Fibula</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the tibia and fibula often occur in association with each other and tend to result from a direct blow, falls with the foot in a flexed position, or a violent twisting motion. Most of these fractures tend to be more distal than proximal; distal fractures may extend into the ankle joint (e.g., distal fractures of the tibia that extend into the joint are collectively referred to as pilon fractures). The patient may present with severe pain, deformity or instability of the leg, obvious hematoma, swelling, and the inability to walk or bear weight on the leg (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Norvell &#x0026; Steele, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1558">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The peroneal nerve is assessed; if damaged, the patient cannot dorsiflex the great toe and has diminished sensation in the first web space. The tibial artery is assessed for damage by evaluating pulses, skin temperature, and color and by testing the capillary refill response. The affected leg and ankle are compared with the unaffected leg and ankle. X-rays are indicated to determine the location, type, and extent of the fracture (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Fields, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1559">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most closed, nondisplaced fractures that do not involve the ankle joint (e.g., extra-articular fractures) are treated with closed reduction and immobilization in a non&#x2013;weight-bearing short leg cast or brace. The leg is elevated to control edema. Weight-bearing status varies and depends on the type of fracture. Activity decreases edema and increases circulation. Fracture healing, based upon clinical assessment and x-ray findings, takes about 10 to 14 weeks; it takes about 6 to 9 months until full function is restored (Eiff, Hatch, &#x0026; Higgins, 2020e).</p>
<p class="indent">Displaced, open, or articular fractures may be treated with skeletal traction, internal fixation with intramedullary nails or plates and screws, or external fixation. External support may be used with internal fixation. Hip, foot, and knee exercises are encouraged within the limits of the immobilizing device. Partial weight bearing is begun when prescribed and is progressed as the fracture heals, which is dependent on the extent of injury (Eiff et al., 2020e).</p>
<p class="indent">As with any fracture, continued neurovascular evaluation is important. The development of acute compartment syndrome requires prompt recognition and communication to the primary provider. Other complications to monitor for include fat emboli, nonunion, delayed union, infection, impaired wound edge healing, long-term calf atrophy, sport limitation, and osteoarthritis (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Fields, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1560">Rib</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Rib fractures are some of the most common thoracic injuries; they occur frequently in adults of all ages, typically from blunt trauma such as motor vehicle crashes or falls, and usually result in no impairment of function. They are typically diagnosed based on clinical presentation and confirmed with anteroposterior (AP) and lateral chest x-rays, CT scan (to rule out suspected thoracic or abdominal injury) or ultrasound (Eiff, Hatch, &#x0026; Higgins, 2020f). Because these fractures cause pain with respiratory effort, the patient tends to decrease respiratory excursions and refrains from coughing. As a result, tracheobronchial secretions are not mobilized, aeration of the lung is diminished, and a predisposition to atelectasis and pneumonia results. The mainstay of treatment is pain control to decrease chest wall splinting and subsequent atelectasis. To help the patient cough and take deep breaths and use an incentive spirometer, the nurse may splint the chest with their hands, or may educate the patient on using a pillow to temporarily splint the affected site. Regularly scheduled analgesics such as acetaminophen in combination with an NSAID may be prescribed to provide analgesic relief. Topical anesthetic patches can provide local pain relief. Occasionally, an anesthesia care provider administers an intercostal nerve block, intrapleural infusion, or epidural infusion to relieve pain and to improve respiratory function (Eiff et al., 2020f).</p>
<p class="indent">Chest binders to immobilize the rib fracture are not used, because decreased chest expansion may result in atelectasis and pneumonia. Incentive spirometer use may aid in prevention of these complications. The fracture heals within 6 weeks. The more ribs that are fractured, the greater the likelihood of complications. In addition to atelectasis and pneumonia, complications may include a flail chest, pneumothorax, and hemothorax (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Melendez &#x0026; Doty, 2017</a>). The assessment and management of patients with these conditions are discussed in <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1561"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults sustaining rib fractures are at an increased risk for complications. Even in the presence of isolated rib trauma, hospital admission is recommended for the older adult with multiple rib fractures or for the older adult who cannot effectively cough and mobilize sputum (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Melendez &#x0026; Doty, 2017</a>). Careful monitoring of respiratory status and encouraging the patient to mobilize early, and, for the patient on bed rest, encouraging turning, coughing, and deep breathing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1193" title="1193"></span>and use of an incentive spirometer, can prevent respiratory complications.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1562">Thoracolumbar Spine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine may involve the vertebral body, the laminae and articulating processes, and the spinous processes or transverse processes. The T12 to L2 area of the spine, called the <em>thoracolumbar junction,</em> is the second most commonly injured region of the spinal column; 90% of all thoracolumbar spine injuries occur at this junction. Fractures generally result from indirect trauma caused by excessive loading, sudden muscle contraction, or excessive motion beyond physiologic limits. Osteoporosis contributes to vertebral body collapse (compression fracture) and accounts for 50% to 70% of all thoracolumbar fractures (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kaji &#x0026; Hockberger, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Stable spinal fractures are caused by flexion, extension, lateral bending, or vertical loading. The anterior structural column (vertebral bodies and discs) or the posterior structural column (neural arch, articular processes, ligaments) is disrupted. Unstable fractures occur with fracture dislocations and involve disruption of both anterior and posterior structural columns.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with a spinal fracture presents with acute tenderness, swelling, paravertebral muscle spasm, and change in the normal curves or in the gap between spinous processes. Pain is greater with moving, coughing, or weight bearing. Thoracolumbar fractures can also present with lower extremity paresis, lower extremity or saddle anesthesia (i.e., loss of sensation to the perineum), or loss of bladder or rectal continence (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kaji &#x0026; Hockberger, 2018</a>). Immobilization is essential until initial assessments have determined if there is any spinal cord injury and whether the fracture is stable or unstable. X-rays are initially indicated to confirm the fracture(s), and CT scans or MRI studies are then indicated to precisely determine the extent of injury and spinal cord involvement (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Vinas, 2018</a>). If spinal cord injury with neurologic deficit does occur, it usually requires immediate surgery (laminectomy with spinal fusion) to decompress the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="indent">Stable spinal fractures are treated conservatively with limited bed rest. Analgesic medications are prescribed for pain relief. A spinal brace or plastic thoraco-lumbar-sacral orthosis is applied for support during progressive ambulation and resumption of activities (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kaji &#x0026; Hockberger, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with an unstable fracture is treated with bed rest, possibly with the use of a special turning device or bed to maintain spinal alignment. Within 24 hours after fracture, open reduction, decompression, and fixation with spinal fusion and instrument stabilization are usually accomplished. Neurologic status is monitored closely during the preoperative and postoperative periods. Postoperatively, the patient may be cared for on the turning device or in a bed with a firm mattress. Progressive ambulation is begun a few days after surgery, with the patient using a molded lumbar or thoracolumbar orthosis for approximately 3 months. Patient education emphasizes good posture, good body mechanics, and, after healing is sufficient, back-strengthening exercises. X-rays with flexion and extension views are taken to monitor the healing process at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months postoperatively; a CT scan can provide a clearer evaluation (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Vinas, 2018</a>). See <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a> for discussion of spinal cord injury.</p>
