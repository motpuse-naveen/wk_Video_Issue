<h4 class="h4" id="s2559">Urethral Stricture</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Urethral stricture is a condition in which a section of the urethra is narrowed. It can occur congenitally or from a scar along the urethra. Traumatic injury to the urethra (e.g., from instrumentation or infections) can result in strictures that restrict urine flow and decrease the urinary stream, leading to spraying or double stream, postvoiding dribbling, and dilation of the proximal urethra and prostatic ducts. Prostatitis is a common complication. Treatment involves dilation of the urethra or, in severe cases, urethrotomy (surgical removal of the stricture). Antimicrobial agents are necessary for resolution of UTIs, followed by long-term prophylactic therapy until the stricture is corrected. Treatment should not be considered successful until at least 1 year has passed, because strictures may recur anytime during that period (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3886">Spilotros, Venn, Anderson, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
