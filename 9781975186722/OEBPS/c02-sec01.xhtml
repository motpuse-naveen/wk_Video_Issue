<h4 class="h4" id="s18">The Practice of Nursing in Today&#x2019;s Health Care Delivery System</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Novice, entry-level registered nurses, as well as those with advanced degrees who work in highly specialized settings, all engage in the practice of nursing. The American Nurses Association (ANA, 2015b) notes that the profession of nursing&#x2019;s scope of practice encompasses the full range of nursing practice, pertinent to general and specialty practice. &#x201C;The depth and breadth in which individual registered nurses and advanced practice registered nurses engage in the total scope of nursing practice is dependent on education, experience, role, and the population served&#x201D; (p. 2). The ANA (2015b, pp. 7&#x2013;9) also identifies the following tenets characteristic of all nursing practice:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Caring and health are central to the practice of the registered nurse.</span></li>
<li><span>Nursing practice is individualized.</span></li>
<li><span>Registered nurses use the nursing process to plan and provide individualized care for health care consumers (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Nurses coordinate care by establishing partnerships.</span></li>
<li><span>A strong link exists between the professional work environment and the registered nurse&#x2019;s ability to provide quality health care and achieve optimal outcomes.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The profession of nursing has a distinct disciplinary body of knowledge, education, and specialty standards of practice (ANA, 2015b); social contract (<a href="#bib94">ANA, 2010</a>; <a href="#bib139">Fowler, 2015</a>); and code of ethics (ANA, 2015a). Nursing&#x2019;s Standards of Practice describe basic competencies in delivering nursing care using the nursing process, whereas the Standards of Professional Performance describe expectations for behavioral competencies (ANA, 2015b, pp. 5&#x2013;6), which include that the registered nurse:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Practices ethically</span></li>
<li><span>Practices in a manner that is congruent with cultural diversity and inclusion principles</span></li>
<li><span>Communicates effectively in all areas of practice</span></li>
<li><span>Collaborates with the health care consumer and other key stakeholders in the conduct of nursing practice</span></li>
<li><span>Leads within the professional practice setting and the profession</span></li>
<li><span>Seeks knowledge and competence that reflect current nursing practice and promote futuristic thinking</span></li>
<li><span>Integrates evidence and research findings into practice</span></li>
<li><span>Contributes to quality nursing practice</span></li>
<li><span>Evaluates one&#x2019;s own and others&#x2019; nursing practice</span></li>
<li><span>Utilizes appropriate resources to plan, provide, and sustain evidence-based nursing services that are safe, effective, and fiscally responsible</span></li>
<li><span>Practices in an environmentally safe and healthy manner</span></li></ul>

<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;medical-surgical nursing:&lt;/b&gt; a specialty area of practice that provides nursing services to patients from adolescence through the end of life in hospital-based and community-based settings">Medical-surgical nursing</button></strong> is a specialty area of practice that provides nursing services to patients from adolescence through the end of life in a variety of inpatient and outpatient clinical settings. These settings may include traditional hospital medical-surgical units as well as intensive care units (ICUs), acute and subacute care rehabilitation units, clinics, ambulatory care units, urgent care centers, home health care agencies, and long-term care facilities (<a href="#bib92">Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses [AMSN], 2018</a>; <a href="#bib101">AMSN 2019</a>). The <em>Scope and Standards of Medical-Surgical Nursing Practice</em> (<a href="#bib92">AMSN, 2018</a>) mirror the scope of practice and standards for practice set by the ANA (2015b) for professional nursing practice; the AMSN (2018) further delineates specific role expectations for the medical-surgical nurse. Medical-surgical nurses can demonstrate proficiency in their role by completing certification requirements. They may also enhance practice by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page35" title="35"></span>completing graduate degree programs in nursing (<a href="#bib92">AMSN, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s20">The Nurse as Coordinator of Care Transitions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nearly one third of the $3.5 trillion spent on health care in the United States is spent on hospitalizations, including hospital readmissions within 30 days of a prior hospital discharge, called <strong>rehospitalizations</strong> (Centers for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Services [CMS], 2018a). Rehospitalizations raise concerns not only about costs, but also about health care quality (<a href="#bib108">Bailey, Weiss, Barrett, et al., 2019</a>). Approximately 20% of patients insured by Medicare experience rehospitalization. Rehospitalizations in those over 65 years of age are not only costly; these patients may experience weakness and stress which can make them vulnerable to falls and other adverse events (<a href="#bib102">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2019</a>). Medicare is one example of a health insurance plan holding hospitals accountable for readmissions within 30 days of hospital discharge through a reduction in reimbursement for costs associated with these readmissions (<a href="#bib139">Bailey et al., 2019</a>). Rehospitalizations can result from breakdowns in care transitions including during the discharge planning processes, as evidenced by patients&#x2019; inability to manage their own care; and, as a result of poor communication between the hospital and the next level of care (e.g., home health agency, primary care office) regarding patients&#x2019; needs and resources (<a href="#bib102">AHRQ, 2019</a>). Altogether, these factors have led to an increasing focus on <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;transitional care:&lt;/b&gt; a process of ensuring consistency and coordination of care as patients move within and between health care settings">transitional care</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bundle:&lt;/b&gt; a set of three to five evidence-based practices that, when implemented appropriately, can measurably improve patient outcomes"></button></strong>, a process of ensuring consistency and coordination of care as patients move within and between care settings (<a href="#bib139">Carr, 2019</a>). For example, transitional care takes place as a patient is transferred from intensive care to a medical-surgical unit within an acute care setting. Another important time of transitional care occurs with patient discharge from the acute care setting to continued care out in the community. See <a href="#ct2-1">Chart&#x00A0;2-1</a> for a Nursing Research Profile on transitional care and the important components needed to assure positive outcomes during this transition process. A number of models and programs of transitional care describe the process as an interdisciplinary team approach in which team members include both the patient and the caregivers. Nurses in a variety of settings are important transitional care team members, managing many aspects of the transition process (<a href="#bib139">Carr, 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Important Components of Transitional Care</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Naylor, M. D., Shaid, E. C., Carpenter, D., et al. (2017). Components of comprehensive and effective transitional care. <em>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</em>, <em>65</em>(6), 1119&#x2013;1125.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Transitional care is recognized as important in assuring improved health care outcomes and health care quality while decreasing costs associated with unnecessary hospital readmissions. A national study called Project ACHIEVE that focused on Medicare beneficiaries was conducted to identify key aspects of transitional care that lead to positive patient and caregiver outcomes.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Project ACHIEVE included experts, patients, and caregivers in a multimethod approach that included interviews, focus groups, and review of literature, which led to the identification and definition of critical components of transitional care. The working group collected case studies to evaluate how these components connect to the real experience of transitional care, selecting one case study for concept mapping of the components, all leading to further refinement of the critical components.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Eight core components were identified and visualized on a transitional care model: patient engagement, caregiver engagement, complexity management, patient education, caregiver education, patient and caregiver well-being, care continuity, and accountability. Each of the eight components was defined with examples of the issues as they related to patients and caregivers. Additional information provided suggestions for interdisciplinary interventions from the reviewed evidence.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Transitional care is a team approach that includes the patient and caregiver, and so research into transitional care should include these important stakeholders. The model and definitions for transitional care yielded from Project ACHIEVE provide a common framework for interdisciplinary health care team members who can then focus on providing optimal patient outcomes. Nurses who work in transitional care can utilize these core components in assessment of individual patients, and then tailor interventions to needed components. The model also provides a framework for program development, evaluation, and future refinement through additional investigation of transitional care.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Patient care must be coordinated seamlessly from the inpatient hospital environment through transitions into the community setting. Various nursing roles have evolved to provide improved care coordination and care transitions, including the nurse navigator, case manager, and the clinical nurse leader (CNL). Nurse navigators are registered nurses employed by hospitals and health networks who work with a given population of patients with a common diagnosis or disease (e.g., cancer). Their role involves helping the patient and the patient&#x2019;s family transition through different levels of care (e.g., from hospital to a skilled nursing facility, from home care to assisted care). One example of an essential role function for the oncology nurse navigator (ONN) is education. In this role, the ONN assesses patients, families, and caregivers for their educational needs and recognizes barriers to education, which can impact health in areas such as diagnosis, treatment, and management of treatment associated side effects (<a href="#bib109">Baileys, McMullen, Lubejko, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Case management is a system of coordinating health care services to ensure cost-effectiveness, accountability, and quality care. Case managers may be nurses or may have backgrounds in other health professions, such as social work. The case manager coordinates the care of a caseload of patients through facilitating communication between nurses, other health care personnel who provide care, and insurance companies. In some settings, particularly the community setting, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page36" title="36"></span>the case manager focuses on coordinating the treatment plan of the patient with complex conditions. The case manager may follow the patient throughout hospitalization and at home after discharge in an effort to coordinate health care services that will avert or delay rehospitalization. The caseload is usually limited in scope to patients with similar diagnoses, needs, and therapies (<a href="#bib111">Case Management Society of America [CMSA], 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A CNL is a certified nurse generalist with a master&#x2019;s degree in nursing educated to help patients navigate the complex health care system (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2019a). The CNL coordinates care for a distinct group of patients, may provide direct care as the situation warrants, and assumes a leadership role among members of the health care team. The CNL integrates evidence-based practices with advocacy, care coordination, outcomes measurement, risk assessment, quality improvement, and interprofessional communication skills (AACN, 2019a). Currently, CNLs are being utilized in hospital-based environments as well as in community settings.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s21">Critical-Care Nursing</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;critical-care nursing:&lt;/b&gt; a specialty area of practice that provides nursing services to critically ill patients across the lifespan in acute care settings such as the hospital intensive unit; current practice settings have expanded to include virtual care and community settings">Critical-care nursing</button></strong> is a specialty area of practice that provides nursing services to critically ill patients across the lifespan, traditionally delivered in acute care settings such as the hospital ICU. Current practice settings for critical-care nursing have now expanded to include virtual care and a variety of community settings, including the home (American Association of Critical-Care Nurses [AACN], 2019b). When patients face actual or potential life-threatening illness, critical-care nurses provide holistic nursing interventions individualized to each patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Scope and Standards for Progressive and Critical-Care Nursing</em> (AACN, 2019b) mirror the scope and standards set by the ANA (2015b) for professional nursing practice; these are revised as needed based on health care trends and technologic advances in the care of patients facing critical illness. The AACN (2019b) further delineates specific role expectations with the nursing process as the foundation and guide. For example, the standard of assessment includes competencies in holistic data collection based on current evidence and the recognition of assessment priorities for each individual patient. The current <em>Scope and Standards</em> (AACN, 2019b) recognize two types of nursing care provided by the progressive care nurse and the critical-care nurse. The progressive care nurse provides care for the acutely ill patient who is moving toward physiologic stability yet still at risk for life-threatening illness. The critical-care nurse provides care for those acute care patients with an actual or at high risk of life-threatening illness. The AACN also sets the standards for proficiency in progressive and critical-care nursing that may lead to specialty certification. In addition to specialty certification, there are opportunities for nurses to enhance critical-care nursing practice by completing graduate nursing programs leading to advanced practice as a critical-care clinical nurse specialist or acute care nurse practitioner.</p>
<p class="indent">The AACN recognizes the role of the critical-care nurse in care transitions and the need to begin discharge planning early, even during the critical or acute phase of hospitalization (<a href="#bib139">Alspach, 2018</a>). With caregiver tasks ranging from activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) (see later discussion) to advocacy and coordination, the critical-care nurse can involve family members or significant others of the patient who is critically ill in rounds and patient care planning, begin to assess their capabilities, and start the education needed so that family members or significant others can manage the role of caregiver.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s22">Rehabilitation Nursing</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rehabilitation:&lt;/b&gt; making able again; learning or relearning skills or abilities or adjusting existing functions to meet maximum potential">Rehabilitation</button></strong> means to make able again; it involves learning or relearning skills or abilities or adjusting existing functions to meet maximum potential. Thus, rehabilitation is a goal-oriented process of caring for people with disability or chronic disorders. This philosophy of practice works to restore or optimize abilities rather than focus on disability (<a href="#bib105">Association of Rehabilitation Nursing [ARN], 2013</a>). Rehabilitation is an integral part of nursing because every major illness or injury carries the threat of disability or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;impairment:&lt;/b&gt; loss or abnormality of psychological, physiologic, or anatomic structure or function at the organ level (e.g., dysphagia, hemiparesis); an abnormality of body structure, appearance, an organ, or system function resulting from any cause">impairment</button></strong>, which involves a loss of function or an abnormality in body structure or function. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rehabilitation nursing:&lt;/b&gt; a specialty area of evidence-based practice that provides holistically-focused nursing services to patients who have been incapacitated by illness or injury or are facing potentially life-altering health conditions throughout their lifespan">Rehabilitation nursing</button></strong> is a specialty area of practice that focuses on returning patients to optimal functionality through a holistic approach to care that is based on scientific evidence (ARN, 2019a). The ARN has developed an <em>ARN Competency Model for Professional Rehabilitation Nurses</em> with resources. The domains in the model (nurse-led interventions, promotion of successful living, leadership and interprofessional care) encompass all competencies needed to promote rehabilitation nursing of people with disability and/or chronic illness (ARN, 2019b). The ARN further describes the roles of the rehabilitation nurse as teacher, caregiver, collaborator, and patient advocate working in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings (ARN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Rehabilitation services are required by more people than ever before because of advances in technology that save or prolong the lives of seriously ill and injured patients and patients with disability. Increasing numbers of patients who are recovering from serious illnesses or injuries are returning to their homes and communities with ongoing needs. Significant disability caused by war and terrorism also increases the demand for rehabilitation services. All patients, regardless of age, gender, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, or diagnosis, have a right to rehabilitation services.</p>
<p class="indent">A person is considered to have a disability, such as a restriction in performance or function in everyday activities, if they have difficulty talking, hearing, seeing, walking, climbing stairs, lifting or carrying objects, performing ADLs, doing schoolwork, or working at a job. The disability is considered severe if the person cannot perform one or more activities, receives federal benefits because of an inability to work, uses an assistive device for mobility, or needs help from another person to accomplish basic activities. The purpose of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assistive technology:&lt;/b&gt; any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is used to improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disability; this term encompasses both assistive devices and adaptive devices">assistive technology</button></strong> is to incorporate devices to improve the functional capabilities of people with disability; these may include any item, piece of equipment, or product system that may be acquired commercially, off the shelf, modified, or customized. Types of assistive technology may include <strong>adaptive devices</strong>, which help a person with a disability to either modify or change the environment (e.g., an access ramp used in place of steps for a person who uses a wheelchair), and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page37" title="37"></span><strong>assistive devices</strong>, which help a person with a disability perform a given task (e.g., a lap board with pictures used to assist a person who cannot talk to communicate) (see <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> for further discussion on disability).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessment of Functional Ability</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Comprehensive assessment of functional capacity is the basis for developing a rehabilitation program. Functional capacity is a person&#x2019;s ability to perform ADLs and IADLs. <strong>Activities of daily living (ADLs)</strong> are those self-care activities that the patient must accomplish each day to meet personal needs; they include personal hygiene/bathing, dressing/grooming, feeding, toileting, and transferring. Many patients cannot perform such activities easily. <strong>Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)</strong> include those complex skills needed for independent living, such as meal preparation, grocery shopping, household and financial management, medication management, telephone usage, and transportation.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse observes the patient performing specific activities (e.g., eating, dressing) and notes the degree of independence; the time taken; the patient&#x2019;s mobility, coordination, and endurance; and the amount of assistance required. The nurse also carefully assesses joint motion, muscle strength, cardiovascular reserve, and neurologic function, because functional ability depends on these factors as well. Observations are recorded on a functional assessment tool. These tools provide a way to standardize assessment parameters and include a scale or score against which improvements may be measured. They also clearly communicate the patient&#x2019;s level of functioning to all members of the rehabilitation team. Rehabilitation staff members use these tools to provide an initial assessment of the patient&#x2019;s abilities and to monitor the patient&#x2019;s progress in achieving independence.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most frequently used tools to assess the patient&#x2019;s level of independence is the Functional Independence Measure (FIM<sup>&#x2122;</sup>) (<a href="#bib118">Keith, Granger, Hamilton, et al., 1987</a>). The FIM is a minimum data set, measuring 18 self-care items including eating, bathing, grooming, dressing upper body, dressing lower body, toileting, bladder management, and bowel management. The FIM addresses transfers and the ability to ambulate and climb stairs and also includes communication and social cognition items. Scoring is based on a seven-point scale, with items used to assess the patient&#x2019;s level of independence. The Alpha FIM, a short version of the FIM, is used frequently within 72 hours of admission in acute care settings to measure functional independence and the amount of assistance the patient needs to perform ADLs.</p>
<p class="indent">Although there are many disease-specific tools used to assess the patient&#x2019;s functional ability, some frequently used generic measures include the following (<a href="#bib115">Fidecki, Wysoki&#x0144;ski, Wro&#x0144;ska, et al., 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz Index) (<a href="#bib117">Katz, Downs, Cash, et al., 1970</a>) is used to assess six areas of ADLs (i.e., bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, feeding) and rate them as done independently or done with assistance.</span></li>
<li><span>The Barthel Index (<a href="#bib120">Mahoney &#x0026; Barthel, 1965</a>) is used to measure the patient&#x2019;s level of independence in ADLs, continence, toileting, transfers, and ambulation (or wheelchair mobility). This scale does not address communicative or cognitive abilities.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">A detailed functional evaluation of secondary conditions related to the patient&#x2019;s disability, such as muscle atrophy and deconditioning, skin integrity, bowel and bladder control, and sexual function, together with residual strengths unaffected by disease or disability, is necessary. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, social, and economic status, as well as cultural and familial environment. These elements may provide a context to the functional findings and influence the rehabilitation plan. For example, the patient&#x2019;s perception of what it means to have a disability and the implications that this might have on familial and social roles can influence the rehabilitation process.</p>
<div class="process">
<p class="processptitle"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing process:&lt;/b&gt; a systematic, problem-solving approach for meeting people&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs; components involve assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation">NURSING PROCESS</button></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse1"><strong>The Patient with Self-Care Deficits in Activities of Daily Living</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">An ADL program is started as soon as the rehabilitation process begins, because the ability to perform ADLs is frequently the key to independence, return to the home, and transition into the community.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse must observe and assess the patient&#x2019;s ability to perform ADLs to determine the level of independence in self-care and the need for nursing intervention. <a href="#ct2-2">Chart&#x00A0;2-2</a> depicts behaviors that may indicate struggles with function or movement and thus should be assessed. For example, bathing requires obtaining bath water and items used for bathing (e.g., soap, washcloth), washing, and drying the body after bathing. Dressing requires getting clothes from the closet, putting on and taking off clothing, and fastening the clothing. Self-feeding requires using utensils to bring food to the mouth and chewing and swallowing the food. Toileting includes removing clothing to use the toilet, cleansing oneself, and readjusting clothing. Grooming activities include combing hair, brushing one&#x2019;s teeth, shaving or applying makeup, and handwashing. Patients who can sit up and raise their hands to their head can begin self-care activities. Assistive devices are often essential in achieving some level of independence in ADLs.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Additional assessment should include gaining an understanding of the patient&#x2019;s and family members&#x2019; perspectives on the patient&#x2019;s condition and how it affects functional ability. The nurse should also be aware of the patient&#x2019;s medical conditions or other health problems, the effect that they have on the ability to perform ADLs, and the family&#x2019;s involvement in the patient&#x2019;s ADLs. This information is valuable in setting goals and developing the plan of care to maximize self-care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Diagnoses</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired ability to perform hygiene</p>

Another major goal is that the patient acknowledges adjustments in new lifestyle and ADLs and can identify resources to facilitate optimal functioning (<a href="#bib139">Carpenito, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Repetition, practice, and demonstrations help patients achieve maximum independence in personal care activities. The nurse&#x2019;s role is to provide an optimal learning environment that minimizes distractions. The nurse can identify the patient&#x2019;s optimal time to work on activities, encourage concentration, identify endurance issues that may affect safety, and provide cues and reminders to patients with specific disability, such as alteration in or loss of sensation that may occur with stroke (<a href="#bib139">Gregory &#x0026; Galloway, 2017</a>). Patients with impaired mobility, sensation, strength, or dexterity may need to use assistive devices to accomplish self-care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>F<small>OSTERING</small> S<small>ELF</small>-C<small>ARE</small> A<small>BILITIES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A patient&#x2019;s approach to self-care may be affected by altered or impaired mobility and influenced by family or cultural expectations. The inability to perform self-care as carried out previously may lead to ineffective coping behaviors, such as social isolation, dependency on caregivers, or depression. The nurse must motivate the patient to learn and accept responsibility for self-care. It helps to encourage an &#x201C;I&#x2019;d rather do it myself&#x201D; attitude. The nurse must also help the patient identify the safe limits of independent activity; knowing when to ask for assistance is particularly important.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse educates, guides, and supports the patient who is learning or relearning how to perform self-care activities while maintaining a focus on patient strengths and optimal level of function. Consistency in instructions and assistance given by health care providers, including rehabilitation therapists (e.g., physiotherapists, occupational therapists, recreation therapists, speech-language pathologists, primary providers) facilitates the learning process. Recording the patient&#x2019;s performance provides data for evaluating progress and may be used as a source for motivation and morale building. Guidelines for educating patients and families about ADLs are presented in <a href="#ct2-3">Chart&#x00A0;2-3</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Often, performing a simple maneuver requires the patient with a disability to concentrate intensely and exert considerable effort; therefore, self-care techniques need to be adapted to accommodate the individual patient&#x2019;s lifestyle. Because a self-care activity usually can be accomplished in several ways, common sense and a little ingenuity may promote increased independence. For example, a person who cannot quite reach his or her head may be able to do so by leaning forward. Encouraging the patient to participate in a support group may also help the patient discover creative solutions to self-care problems.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Preexisting cultural norms may influence the degree of self-care the patient is willing to consider. Cultural and ethnic beliefs about hygiene can vary among individuals and families. The nurse must recognize these beliefs, work through any issues with the patient and family, and communicate pertinent findings to the rehabilitation team.</p>

<p class="processppara">If the patient has difficulty performing an ADL, an adaptive or assistive device (self-help device) may be useful. Such devices may be obtained commercially or can be constructed by the nurse, occupational therapist, patient, or family. The devices may include built-up handles on toothbrushes or razors; long, curved handles on mirrors or shoe horns; suction cups to hold items in place; shower chairs; raised toilet seats; and universal cuffs to grip self-care items. Some of these are shown in <a href="#ff2-1">Figure&#x00A0;2-1</a>. To assist premenopausal women with managing menstruation, clothing adaptations (e.g., Velcro crotch flaps for ease of access), mirrors, self-sticking sanitary pads, packaged wipes, and loose underwear may be used.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">A wide selection of computerized devices is available, or devices can be designed to help individual patients with severe disability to function more independently. The AbleData project (see Resources list at the end of this chapter) offers a computerized listing of commercially available aids and equipment for patients with disability.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse should be alert to &#x201C;gadgets&#x201D; coming on the market and evaluate their potential usefulness. The nurse must exercise professional judgment and caution in recommending devices, because in the past, unscrupulous vendors have marketed unnecessary, overly expensive, or useless items to patients.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>H<small>ELPING</small> P<small>ATIENTS</small> A<small>CCEPT</small> L<small>IMITATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">If the patient has a severe disability, independent self-care may be an unrealistic goal. In this situation, the nurse educates the patient how to take charge by directing their care. The patient may require a personal caregiver to perform ADLs. Family members may not be appropriate for providing bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, feeding, and toileting assistance, and spouses may have difficulty providing bowel and bladder care for patients and maintaining the role of sexual partners. If a personal caregiver is necessary, the patient and family members must learn how to manage an employee effectively. The nurse helps the patient accept self-care dependency. Independence in other areas, such as social interaction, should be emphasized to promote a positive self-concept.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NSURING</small> E<small>FFECTIVE</small> H<small>EALTH</small> M<small>ANAGEMENT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse ensures effective health management by educating the patient and caregiver in appropriate language so that they understand the nature of the health condition or disorder and the resulting changes in ADLs. This understanding facilitates transition to a new way of life upon discharge. Barriers that may impede successful health maintenance are identified and strategies employed to mitigate them. The transition team, under the guidance of the nurse, collaborates on identifying and securing resources that are needed to make the transition successful and prevent complications (<a href="#bib139">Carpenito, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitle"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing process:&lt;/b&gt; a systematic, problem-solving approach for meeting people&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs; components involve assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation">NURSING PROCESS</button></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse2"><strong>The Patient with Impaired Physical Mobility</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Problems commonly associated with immobility include weakened muscles, joint contracture, and deformity. Each joint of the body has a normal range of motion; if the range is limited, the functions of the joint and the muscles that move the joint are impaired, and painful deformities may develop. The nurse must identify patients at risk for such complications. The nurse needs to assess, plan, and intervene to prevent complications of immobility.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Another problem frequently seen in rehabilitation nursing is an altered ambulatory/mobility pattern. Patients with disability may be either temporarily or permanently unable to walk independently and unaided. The nurse assesses the mobility of the patient and designs care that promotes independent mobility within the prescribed therapeutic limits. If a patient cannot exercise and move his or her joints through their full range of motion, contractures may develop. A contracture is a shortening of the muscle and tendon that leads to deformity and limits joint mobility. When the contracted joint is moved, the patient experiences pain; in addition, more energy is required to move when joints are contracted.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Disability brings change to the patient and family unit as well as adjustments in lifestyle, mobility, and interactions as members of a community. Whether temporary or permanent, patients can grieve the loss of health and will need to process the loss as part of the adaptation process and plan of care (<a href="#bib139">Carpenito, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Mobility may be restricted owing to pain, paralysis, loss of muscle strength, systemic disease, an immobilizing device (e.g., cast, brace), or prescribed limits to promote healing. Assessment of mobility includes positioning, ability to move, muscle strength and tone, joint function, and the prescribed mobility limits. The nurse must collaborate with physical therapists or other team members to assess mobility.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During position change, transfer, and ambulation activities, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s abilities, the extent of disability, and residual capacity for physiologic adaptation. The nurse observes for orthostatic hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, tachycardia, and fatigue.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s ability to use various assistive devices that promote mobility. If the patient cannot ambulate without assistance, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s ability to balance, transfer, and use assistive devices (e.g., crutches, walker). Crutch walking requires high energy expenditure and produces considerable cardiovascular stress; therefore, people with reduced exercise capacity, decreased arm strength, and problems with balance because of aging or multiple diseases may be unable to use crutches. A walker is more stable and may be a better choice for such patients. If the patient uses an orthosis, the nurse monitors the patient for effective use and potential problems associated with its use.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The assessment process includes gaining an understanding of the meaning of illness or disability for the patient and family, whether it be a temporary or permanent loss of normal functioning or lifestyle. Signs and symptoms evidenced by the patient or family members such as disbelief, crying, expressions of emotions such as sorrow and anger can be part of the grieving process. The nurse collaborates with the interdisciplinary team to develop a holistic plan of care that addresses relevant actual or potential nursing diagnoses (<a href="#bib139">Carpenito, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired mobility</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Activity intolerance or risk for activity intolerance</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Grief</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Major goals for the patient may include absence of contracture and deformity, maintenance of muscle strength and joint mobility, independent mobility, increased activity tolerance, and prevention of further disability. A major goal for the patient and family may include that they express an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page41" title="41"></span>understanding of the meaning of the illness or disability and its associated losses.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>OSITIONING TO</small> P<small>REVENT</small> M<small>USCULOSKELETAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Deformities and contractures can often be prevented by proper positioning. Maintaining correct body alignment when the patient is in bed is essential regardless of the position selected. During each patient contact, the nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s position and assists the patient to achieve and maintain proper positioning and alignment. The most common positions that patients assume in bed are supine (dorsal), side-lying (lateral), and prone. The nurse helps the patient assume these positions and uses pillows to support the body in correct alignment. At times, a splint (e.g., wrist or hand splint) may be made by the occupational therapist to support a joint and prevent deformity. The nurse must ensure proper use of the splint and provide skin care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Preventing External Rotation of the Hip.</span> The patient who is in bed for an extended period of time may develop external rotation deformity of the hip because the ball-and-socket joint of the hip tends to rotate outward when the patient lies on their back. A trochanter roll (i.e., a flannel sheet or bath towel folded in thirds lengthwise and rolled toward the patient or a commercially manufactured roll) extending from the crest of the ilium to the midthigh prevents this deformity; with correct placement, it serves as a mechanical wedge under the projection of the greater trochanter.</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">Abduction moves the body part away from the body; adduction moves the body part toward the body. External rotation occurs as the leg moves outward. To prevent external rotation deformity, the patient&#x2019;s hip should <em>not</em> be abducted or moved away from the body.</p>
</div>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Preventing Footdrop.</span> Footdrop is a deformity in which the foot is plantar flexed (the ankle bends in the direction of the sole of the foot). If the condition continues without correction, the patient will not be able to hold the foot in a normal position and will be able to walk only on their toes, without touching the ground with the heel of the foot. The deformity is caused by contracture of both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Damage to the peroneal nerve or loss of flexibility of the Achilles tendon may also result in footdrop. To prevent this disabling deformity, the patient is positioned to sit at a 90-degree angle in a wheelchair with the feet on the footrests or flat on the floor.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When the patient is supine in bed, padded splints or protective boots are used to keep the patient&#x2019;s feet at right angles to the legs. Frequent skin inspection of the feet must also be performed to determine whether positioning devices have created any unwanted pressure areas.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is encouraged to perform the following ankle exercises several times each hour: dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the feet, flexion and extension (curl and stretch) of the toes, and eversion and inversion of the feet at the ankles. The nurse provides frequent passive range-of-motion exercises if the patient cannot perform active exercises.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> M<small>USCLE</small> S<small>TRENGTH AND</small> J<small>OINT</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Optimal function depends on the strength of the muscles and joint motion, and active participation in ADLs promotes maintenance of muscle strength and joint mobility. Range-of-motion exercises and specific therapeutic exercises may be included in the nursing plan of care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Performing Range-of-Motion Exercises.</span> Range of motion involves moving a joint through its full range in all appropriate planes (<a href="#ct2-4">Chart&#x00A0;2-4</a>). To maintain or increase the motion of a joint, range-of-motion exercises are initiated as soon as the patient&#x2019;s condition permits. The exercises are planned for individual patients to accommodate the wide variation in the degrees of motion that people of varying body builds and age groups can attain.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Range-of-motion exercises may be active (performed by the patient under the supervision of the nurse), assisted (with the nurse helping if the patient cannot do the exercise independently), or passive (performed by the nurse). Unless otherwise prescribed, a joint should be moved through its range of motion three times, at least two times a day. The joint to be exercised is supported, the bones above the joint are stabilized, and the body part distal to the joint is moved through the range of motion of the joint. For example, the humerus must be stabilized while the radius and ulna are moved through their range of motion at the elbow joint.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A joint should not be moved beyond its free range of motion; the joint is moved to the point of resistance and stopped at the point of pain. If muscle spasms are present, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page42" title="42"></span>the joint is moved slowly to the point of resistance. Gentle, steady pressure is then applied until the muscle relaxes, and the motion is continued to the joint&#x2019;s final point of resistance.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">To perform assisted or passive range-of-motion exercises, the patient must be in a comfortable supine position with the arms at the sides and the knees extended. Good body posture is maintained during the exercises. The nurse also uses good body mechanics during the exercise session.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Performing Therapeutic Exercises.</span> Therapeutic exercises are prescribed by the primary provider and performed with the assistance and guidance of the physical therapist or nurse. The patient should have a clear understanding of the goal of the prescribed exercise. Written instructions about the frequency, duration, and number of repetitions, as well as simple line drawings of the exercise, help to ensure adherence to the exercise program. Return demonstration of the exercises also helps the patient and family to follow the instructions correctly.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When performed correctly, exercise assists in maintaining and building muscle strength, maintaining joint function, preventing deformity, stimulating circulation, developing endurance, and promoting relaxation. Exercise is also valuable in helping to restore motivation and the well-being of the patient. Weight-bearing exercises may slow the bone loss that occurs with disability. There are five types of exercise: passive, active-assistive, active, resistive, and isometric. The description, purpose, and action of each of these exercises are summarized in <a href="#tt2-1">Table&#x00A0;2-1</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> I<small>NDEPENDENT</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">When the patient&#x2019;s condition stabilizes, their physical condition permits, and the patient is able to stand, the patient is assisted to sit up on the side of the bed and then to stand. Tolerance of this activity is assessed. Orthostatic (postural) hypotension may develop when the patient assumes a vertical position. Because of inadequate vasomotor reflexes, blood pools in the splanchnic (visceral or intestinal) area and in the legs, resulting in inadequate cerebral circulation. If indicators of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., drop in blood pressure, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, tachycardia, dizziness) are present, the activity is stopped, and the patient is assisted to a supine position in bed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Some disabling conditions, such as spinal cord injury (SCI), acute brain injury, and other conditions that require extended periods in the recumbent position, prevent the patient from assuming an upright position at the bedside. Several strategies can be used to help the patient assume a 90-degree sitting position. A reclining wheelchair with elevating leg rests allows a slow and controlled progression from a supine position to a 90-degree sitting position. A tilt table (a board that can be tilted in 10-degree increments from a horizontal to a vertical position) may also be used. The tilt table promotes vasomotor adjustment to positional changes and helps patients with limited standing balance and limited weight-bearing activities avoid the decalcification of bones and low bone mass associated with disuse syndrome and lack of weight-bearing exercise. Physical therapists may use a tilt table for patients who have not been upright owing to illness or disability. Gradual elevation of the head of the bed may help. When getting patients with SCI out of bed, it is important to gradually raise the head of the bed to a 90-degree angle; this may take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Graduated compression stockings are used to prevent venous stasis. For some patients, a compression garment (leotard) or snug-fitting abdominal binder and elastic compression bandaging of the legs are needed to prevent venous stasis <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page43" title="43"></span>and orthostatic hypotension. When the patient is standing, the feet are protected with a pair of properly fitted shoes. Extended periods of standing are avoided because of venous pooling and pressure on the soles of the feet. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure and pulse and observes for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and cerebral insufficiency (e.g., the patient reports feeling faint and weak), which suggest intolerance of the upright position. If the patient does not tolerate the upright position, the nurse should return the patient to the reclining position and elevate their legs.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Assisting Patients with Transfer.</span> A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;transfer:&lt;/b&gt; movement of a patient from one place to another, such as a bed to chair, chair to commode, or wheelchair to tub">transfer</button></strong> is movement of the patient from one place to another (e.g., bed to chair, chair to commode, wheelchair to tub). As soon as the patient is permitted out of bed, transfer activities are started. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s ability to participate actively in the transfer and determines, in conjunction with occupational therapists or physical therapists, the adaptive equipment required to promote independence and safety. A lightweight wheelchair with brake extensions, removable and detachable armrests, and leg rests minimize structural obstacles during the transfer. Tub seats or benches make transfers in and out of the tub easier and safer. Raised, padded commode seats may also be warranted for patients who must avoid flexing the hips greater than 90 degrees when transferring to a toilet. It is important that the nurse educate the patient about hip precautions (e.g., no adduction past the midline, no flexion greater than 90 degrees, and no internal rotation); abduction pillows can be used to keep the hip in correct alignment if precautions are warranted.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">It is important that the patient maintains muscle strength and, if possible, performs push-up exercises to strengthen the arm and shoulder extensor muscles. The push-up exercises require the patient to sit upright in bed; a book is placed under each of the patient&#x2019;s hands to provide a hard surface, and the patient is instructed to push down on the book, raising the body. The nurse should encourage the patient to raise and move the body in different directions by means of these push-up exercises.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse or physical therapist instructs the patient how to transfer. There are several methods of transferring from the bed to the wheelchair when the patient cannot stand, and the technique chosen should consider the patient&#x2019;s abilities and disability. It is helpful to demonstrate the technique to the patient. If the physical therapist is involved in teaching the patient to transfer, the nurse and physical therapist must collaborate so that consistent instructions are given to the patient. During transfer, the nurse assists and coaches the patient. <a href="#ff2-2">Figure&#x00A0;2-2</a> shows weight-bearing and non&#x2013;weight-bearing transfers. For example, with a weight-bearing transfer from bed to chair, the patient stands up, pivots until his back is opposite the new seat, and sits down. If the patient&#x2019;s muscles are not strong enough to overcome the resistance of body weight, a polished lightweight board (transfer board, sliding board) may be used to bridge the gap between the bed and the chair. The patient slides across on the board with or without assistance from a caregiver. This board may also be used to transfer the patient from the chair to the toilet or bathtub bench. It is important to avoid the effects of shear on the patient&#x2019;s skin while sliding across the board. The nurse should make sure that the patient&#x2019;s fingers do not curl around the edge of the board during the transfer, because the patient&#x2019;s body weight can crush the fingers as they move across the board.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Safety is a primary concern during a transfer, and the following guidelines are recommended:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wheelchairs and beds must be locked before transfer begins.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Detachable arm- and footrests are removed to make getting in and out of the chair easier.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>One end of the transfer board is placed under the buttocks and the other end on the surface to which the transfer is being made (e.g., the chair).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The patient is instructed to lean forward, push up with his or her hands, and then slide across the board to the other surface.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nurses frequently assist patients who are weak and incapacitated out of bed. The nurse supports and gently assists the patient during position changes, protecting the patient from injury. The nurse avoids pulling on a weak or paralyzed upper extremity to prevent dislocation of the shoulder. The patient is assisted to move toward the stronger side.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In the home setting, getting in and out of bed and performing chair, toilet, and tub transfers are difficult for patients with weak muscles and loss of hip, knee, and ankle motion. A rope attached to the headboard of the bed enables a patient to move toward the center of the bed, and the use of a rope attached to the footboard facilitates getting in and out of bed. The height of a chair can be raised with cushions on the seat or with hollowed-out blocks placed under the chair legs. Grab bars can be attached to the wall near the toilet and tub to provide leverage and stability.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Preparing for Ambulation.</span> Regaining the ability to walk is a prime morale builder. However, to be prepared for ambulation&#x2014;whether with a brace, walker, cane, or crutches&#x2014;the patient must strengthen the muscles required. Therefore, exercise is the foundation of preparation. The nurse and physical therapist instruct and supervise the patient in these exercises.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For ambulation, the quadriceps muscles, which stabilize the knee joint, and the gluteal muscles are strengthened. To perform quadriceps-setting exercises, the patient contracts the quadriceps muscle by attempting to push the popliteal area against the mattress and at the same time raising the heel. The patient maintains the muscle contraction for a count of five and relaxes for a count of five. The exercise is repeated 10 to 15 times hourly. Exercising the quadriceps muscles prevents flexion contractures of the knee. In gluteal setting, the patient contracts or &#x201C;pinches&#x201D; the buttocks together for a count of five, relaxes for a count of five; the exercise is repeated 10 to 15 times hourly.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If assistive devices (i.e., walker, cane, crutches) will be used, the muscles of the upper extremities are exercised and strengthened. Push-up exercises are especially useful. While in a sitting position, the patient raises the body by pushing the hands against the chair seat or mattress. The patient should be encouraged to do push-up exercises while in a prone position as well. Pull-up exercises done on a trapeze while lifting the body are also effective for conditioning. The patient is taught to raise the arms above the head and then lower them in a slow, rhythmic manner while holding weights. Gradually, the weight is increased. The hands are strengthened by squeezing a rubber ball.</p>

(<strong>Right</strong>) Non&#x2013;weight-bearing transfer, pull-up method. One of the wheelchair arms is removed to make getting in and out of the chair easier.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Typically, the physical therapist designs exercises to help the patient develop sitting and standing balance, stability, and coordination needed for ambulation. After sitting and standing balance is achieved, the patient is able to use parallel bars. Under the supervision of the physical therapist, the patient practices shifting weight from side to side, lifting one leg while supporting weight on the other, and then walking between the parallel bars.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A patient who is ready to begin ambulation must be fitted with the appropriate assistive device, instructed about the prescribed weight-bearing limits (e.g., non&#x2013;weight-bearing, partial weight-bearing ambulation), and taught how to use the device safely. <a href="#ff2-3">Figure&#x00A0;2-3</a> illustrates some of the more common assistive devices used in rehabilitation settings. The nurse continually assesses the patient for stability and adherence to weight-bearing precautions and protects the patient from falling. The nurse provides contact guarding by holding on to a gait belt that the patient wears around the waist. The patient should wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes and be advised of the dangers of wet or highly polished floors and throw rugs. The patient should also learn how to ambulate on inclines, uneven surfaces, and stairs.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<small>MBULATING WITH AN</small> A<small>SSISTIVE</small> D<small>EVICE</small>: C<small>RUTCHES, A</small> W<small>ALKER, OR A</small> C<small>ANE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Crutches are for partial weight-bearing or non&#x2013;weight-bearing ambulation. Good balance, adequate cardiovascular reserve, strong upper extremities, and erect posture are essential for crutch walking. Ambulating a functional distance (at least the length of a room or house) or maneuvering stairs on crutches requires significant arm strength, because the arms must bear the patient&#x2019;s weight (<a href="#ff2-4">Fig.&#x00A0;2-4</a>). The nurse or physical therapist determines which gait is best (<a href="#ct2-5">Chart&#x00A0;2-5</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A walker provides more support and stability than a cane or crutches. A pick-up walker is best for patients with poor balance and poor cardiovascular reserve, and a rolling walker, which allows automatic walking, is best for patients who cannot lift. A cane helps the patient walk with balance and support and relieves the pressure on weight-bearing joints by redistributing weight.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Before patients can be considered to be independent in walking with crutches, a walker, or a cane, they should learn to sit, stand from sitting, and go up and down stairs using the device. <a href="#tt2-2">Table&#x00A0;2-2</a> describes how patients can ambulate and maneuver using each of the three devices and nursing actions to support using assistive devices.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<small>SSISTING</small> P<small>ATIENTS WITH AN</small> O<small>RTHOSIS OR</small> P<small>ROSTHESIS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Orthoses and prostheses are designed to facilitate mobilization and to maximize the patient&#x2019;s quality of life. An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orthosis:&lt;/b&gt; an external appliance that provides support, prevents or corrects joint deformities, and improves function">orthosis</button></strong> is an external appliance that provides support, prevents or corrects deformities, and improves function. Orthoses include braces, splints, collars, corsets, and supports that are designed and fitted by orthotists or prosthetists. Static orthoses (no moving parts) are used to stabilize joints and prevent contractures. Dynamic orthoses are flexible and are used to improve function by assisting weak muscles. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prosthesis:&lt;/b&gt; a device used to replace a body part">prosthesis</button></strong> is an artificial body part that may be internal, such as an artificial knee or hip joint, or external, such as an artificial leg or arm.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff2-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff2-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff2-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;2-4 &#x2022;</span> For a person walking with crutches, the tripod stance, with crutches out to the sides and in front of the toes, increases stability.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to learning how to apply and remove the orthosis and maneuver the affected body part correctly, patients must learn how to properly care for the skin that comes in contact with the appliance. Skin problems or pressure injuries may develop if the device is applied too tightly or too loosely, or if it is adjusted improperly. The nurse instructs the patient to clean and inspect the skin daily, to make sure the brace fits snugly without being too tight, to check that the padding distributes pressure evenly, and to wear a cotton garment without seams between the orthosis and the skin.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient has had an amputation, the nurse promotes tissue healing, uses compression dressings to promote residual limb shaping, and minimizes contracture formation. A permanent prosthetic limb cannot be fitted until the tissue has healed completely and the residual limb shape is stable and free from edema. The nurse also helps the patient cope with the emotional issues surrounding loss of a limb and encourages acceptance of the prosthesis. The prosthetist, nurse, and primary provider collaborate to provide instructions related to skin care and care of the prosthesis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>S<small>UPPORTING THE</small> G<small>RIEVING</small> P<small>ROCESS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Developing a trusting nurse&#x2013;patient relationship provides an opportunity to support patients and families as they grieve and process the meaning of the illness or disability, whether it be a temporary or permanent loss of normal functioning and lifestyle. The nurse helps the grieving process by providing clear, simple communications that do not minimize the loss. The nurse also educates the patient and family about the grieving process, normal grief reactions, and signs and symptoms of complicated grieving. Time should be planned to share feelings in a safe setting which provides needed privacy. In many cases, just being present and listening supports the grieving process. Patients and families may benefit from community resources such as support groups as well as connection to their local faith community for spiritual support through the changes associated with disability (<a href="#bib139">Carpenito, 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An important goal of rehabilitation is to assist the patient to return to the home environment after learning to manage the disability. A referral system maintains continuity of care when the patient is transferred to the home or to a long-term care facility. The plan for discharge is formulated when the patient is first admitted to the hospital, and discharge plans are made with the patient&#x2019;s functional potential in mind.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Significant expenditures of time and resources are necessary to ensure that patients gain the skills and confidence to self-manage their health effectively after discharge from the hospital (<a href="#bib121">Naylor, Shaid, Carpenter, et al., 2017</a>). Formal programs provide patients with effective strategies for interpreting and managing disease-specific issues and skills needed for problem solving, as well as building and maintaining self-awareness and self-efficacy. Self-care programs often use multifaceted approaches, including didactic teaching, group sessions, individual learning plans, and Web-based resources. When planning the approach to self-care, the nurse must consider the individual patient&#x2019;s knowledge, experience, social and cultural background, level of formal education, and psychological status. The preparation for self-care must also be spread out over the course of the recovery period, and it must be monitored and updated regularly as the patient masters aspects of self-care. Preparation for self-care is also highly relevant for informal caregivers of patients in rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="indent">When a patient is discharged from acute care or a rehabilitation facility, informal caregivers, typically family members, often assume the care and support of the patient. Although the most obvious care tasks involve physical care (e.g., personal hygiene, dressing, meal preparation), other elements of the caregiving role include psychosocial support and a commitment to this supportive role. Thus, the nurse must assess the patient&#x2019;s support system (family, friends) well in advance of discharge. The positive attitudes of family and friends toward the patient, the patient&#x2019;s disability, and the return home are important in making a successful transition to home. Not all families can carry out the arduous programs of exercise, physical therapy, and personal care that the patient may need. They may not have the resources or stability to care for family members with a severe disability. The physical, emotional, economic, and energy strains of a disabling condition may overwhelm even a stable family. Members of the rehabilitation team must not judge the family but rather should provide supportive interventions that help the family to attain its highest level of function.</p>
<p class="indent">The family members need to know as much as possible about the patient&#x2019;s condition and care so that they do not fear the patient&#x2019;s return home. The nurse develops methods to help the patient and family cope with problems that may arise. For example, the nurse may develop an ADLs checklist individualized for the patient and family to ensure that the family is proficient in assisting the patient with certain tasks (<a href="#ct2-6">Chart&#x00A0;2-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A home health or transitional care nurse may visit the patient prior to discharge, interview the patient and the family, and review the ADLs sheet to learn which activities the patient can perform. This helps to ensure that continuity of care is provided and that the patient does not regress yet maintains the independence gained while in the hospital or rehabilitation setting. The family may need to purchase, borrow, or improvise needed equipment, such as safety rails, a raised toilet seat or commode, or a tub bench. Ramps may need to be built or doorways widened to allow full access.</p>
<p class="indent">Family members are taught how to use equipment and are given a copy of the equipment manufacturer&#x2019;s instruction booklet, the names of resource people, lists of equipment-related supplies, and locations where they may be obtained. A written summary of the care plan is included in family education. The patient and family members are reminded about the importance of routine health screening and other health promotion strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">A network of support services and communication systems may be required to enhance opportunities for independent living. The nurse uses collaborative, administrative skills to coordinate these activities and pull together the network of care. The nurse also provides skilled care, initiates additional referrals when indicated, and serves as a patient advocate and counselor when obstacles are encountered. The nurse continues to reinforce prior patient education and helps the patient to set and achieve attainable goals. The degree to which the patient adapts to the home and community environment depends on the confidence and self-esteem developed during the rehabilitation process and on the acceptance, support, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page49" title="49"></span>and reactions of family members, employers, and community members.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">There is a growing trend toward independent living by people with severe disability, either alone or in groups that share resources. Preparation for independent living should include training in managing a household and working with personal caregivers as well as training in mobility. The goal is integration into the community&#x2014;living and working in the community with accessible housing, employment, public buildings, transportation, and recreation.</p>
<p class="indent">State rehabilitation administration agencies provide services to assist people with disability in obtaining the help they need to engage in gainful employment. These services include diagnostic, medical, and mental health services. Counseling, training, placement, and follow-up services are available to help people with disability select and obtain jobs.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is transferred to a long-term care facility, the transition is planned to promote continued progress. Independence gained continues to be supported, and progress is fostered. Adjustment to the facility is promoted through communication. Family members are encouraged to visit, to be involved, and to take the patient home on weekends and holidays if possible.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s23">Home Health Nursing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Home health care is a unique component of posthospital care for patients who return home to complete recuperation following an acute illness episode or exacerbation of chronic illness. Home health agencies can also provide advanced technologies in the home setting. All together, these services provided in the home setting work to maximize the patient&#x2019;s ability to function at his highest level of wellness (<a href="#bib139">Rector, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The ANA defines <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;home health nursing:&lt;/b&gt; a specialty area of practice that provides nursing services to patients across the lifespan in a home setting; practice roles include holistic care planning which incorporates resource and service coordination as part of an interdisciplinary team">home health nursing</button></strong> as a specialty area of practice that provides nursing services to patients across the lifespan in a home setting (<a href="#bib139">Wilson, 2019</a>). Home health nursing practice roles include holistic care planning, which incorporates resource and service coordination as part of a collaborative interdisciplinary team. This team includes home health aides; social workers; physical, speech, and occupational therapists; and primary providers. The approach provides health and social services with oversight of the total health care plan by a case manager, clinical nurse specialist, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" title="50"></span>nurse practitioner. Interdisciplinary collaboration is required if a home health agency is to receive Medicare certification (<a href="#bib139">Rector, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most home health agencies are reimbursed by various sources, including Medicare and Medicaid programs, private insurance, and direct patient payment. Older adults are the most frequent users of home care expenditures financed by Medicare, which allows nurses to manage and evaluate care of seriously ill patients who have complex, labile conditions and are at high risk for rehospitalization. Each funding source has its own requirements for services rendered, number of visits allowed, and amount of reimbursement the agency receives. The Omaha System&#x2019;s care documentation, referred to as the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), has been a requirement for some time to ensure that outcome-based care is provided for all care reimbursed by Medicare. This system uses sociodemographic, environment, support system, health status, and functional status domains to assess and plan care for adult patients. OASIS is also used to collect data and improve performance or quality outcomes (CMS, 2018b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Services Provided</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many home care patients are acutely ill or have chronic health problems or disability requiring that nurses provide more education and monitoring to patients and families. Home health nurses make home visits to provide skilled nursing care, follow-up care, and education to promote health and prevent complications. Home health care visits may be intermittent or periodic, and case management via telephone or Internet may be used to promote communication with home care consumers. The nurse instructs the patient and family about skills, self-care strategies, and health maintenance and promotion activities (e.g., nutritional counseling, exercise programs, stress management). Nursing care includes skilled assessment of the patient&#x2019;s physical, psychological, social, and environmental status (<a href="#ff2-5">Fig.&#x00A0;2-5</a>). Nursing interventions may include intravenous (IV) therapy and injections, parenteral nutrition, venipuncture, catheter insertion, pressure injury treatment, wound care, ostomy care, and patient and family education. Complex technical equipment such as mechanical ventilation and procedures such as peritoneal dialysis may be involved in home health care. Nurses have a role in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of technology in the home setting. In addition, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;telehealth:&lt;/b&gt; the use of technology to deliver health care, health information, or health education at a distance">telehealth</button></strong> is useful in home health care in facilitating exchange of information via telephone or computers between patients and nurses regarding health information such as blood glucose readings, vital signs, and cardiac parameters. The use of a broad spectrum of computer and Internet resources, such as webcams, also facilitates exchange of information (<a href="#bib139">Rector, 2018</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">The Home Setting</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The home health nurse is a guest in the patient&#x2019;s home and must have permission to visit and give care. The nurse has minimal control over the lifestyle, living situation, and health practices of the visited patients. This lack of full decision making authority can create a conflict for the nurse and lead to problems in the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship. To work successfully with patients in any setting, the nurse must be nonjudgmental and convey respect for patients&#x2019; beliefs, even if they differ sharply from those of the nurse. This can be difficult when a patient&#x2019;s lifestyle involves activities that a nurse considers harmful or unacceptable, such as smoking, excessive use of alcohol, use of illicit drugs or misuse of prescription drugs, or overeating (<a href="#bib139">Rector, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The cleanliness of a patient&#x2019;s home may not meet the standards of a hospital. Although the nurse can provide education points about maintaining clean surroundings, the patient and family decide if they will implement the nurse&#x2019;s suggestions. The nurse must accept their decisions and deliver the care required regardless of the conditions of the setting. The kind of equipment and the supplies or resources that usually are available in acute care settings are often unavailable in the patient&#x2019;s home. The nurse has to learn to improvise when providing care, such as when changing a dressing or catheterizing a patient in a regular bed that is not adjustable and lacks a bedside table (<a href="#bib139">Rector, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Infection control is as important in the home as it is in the hospital; however, it can be more challenging in the home and requires creative approaches. As in any situation, it is important to perform hand hygiene before and after giving direct patient care, even in a home that does not have running water. If aseptic technique is required, the nurse must have a plan for implementing this technique before going to the home. This applies to universal precautions, transmission-based precautions, and disposal of bodily secretions and excretions. If injections are given, the nurse must use a closed container to dispose of syringes. Injectable and other medications must be kept out of the reach of children during visits and stored in a safe place if the medications remain in the home.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Home Health Visits</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most agencies have a policy manual that identifies the agency&#x2019;s philosophy and procedures and defines the services provided. The eligibility of a patient and provision of services may be prescribed by the type of insurance the patient carries. For example, Medicare beneficiaries must meet certain eligibility requirements such as homebound criteria and may be permitted only intermittent skilled services of a registered nurse or licensed therapist (CMS, 2019). Becoming familiar with these policies is essential before initiating a home visit. It is also important to know the state laws regarding what actions to take if the nurse finds a patient dead, suspects abuse, determines that a patient cannot safely remain at home, or observes a situation that possibly indicates harm to the community at large.</p>
<p class="h7">Preparing for a Home Visit</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before making a home visit, the nurse should review pertinent data about the patient that is typically provided on a referral form. It may be necessary to contact the referring agency if the purpose for the referral is unclear or important information is missing. The nurse calls the patient to obtain permission to visit, schedules a time for the visit, and verifies the address. This initial phone conversation provides an opportunity to introduce oneself, identify the agency, and explain the reason for the visit. If the patient does not have a telephone, the nurse should see if the person who made the referral is able to contact the patient regarding the visit. If an unannounced visit to a patient&#x2019;s home must be made, the nurse should ask permission to come in before entering the house. Explaining the purpose of the referral at the outset and setting up the times for future visits before leaving are also recommended.</p>
<p class="h7">Conducting a Home Visit</p>
<p class="h8">Personal Safety Precautions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Home health nurses must pay attention to personal safety, because they often practice in unknown environments. Based on the principle of due diligence, agencies should investigate at-risk working environments prior to making the assignment and must inform employees accordingly. Agencies have policies and procedures concerning the promotion of safety for clinical staff, and training is provided to facilitate personal safety. The individual nurse and agency must proactively assess environments for safety. Suggested precautions to take when making a home visit are presented in <a href="#ct2-7">Chart&#x00A0;2-7</a>.</p>
<p class="h8">Initial Home Visit</p>
<p class="nonindent">The first visit sets the tone for subsequent visits and is crucial in establishing the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship. The situations encountered depend on numerous factors. Patients may be in pain and have additional factors that make them unable to care for themselves. Family members may be overwhelmed and doubt their ability to care for loved ones. They may not understand why the patient was sent home from the hospital before being totally rehabilitated. They may not comprehend what home care is or why they cannot have 24-hour nursing services. It is critical that the nurse conveys an understanding of what patients and families are experiencing and how the illness is affecting their lives.</p>

<p class="indent">During the initial home visit, which may take 1 hour or more, the patient is evaluated and a plan of care is established that may be modified on subsequent visits. The nurse informs the patient of the agency&#x2019;s practices, policies, and hours of operation. If the agency is to be reimbursed for the visit, the nurse asks for insurance information, such as a Medicare or Medicaid card. The initial assessment includes evaluating the patient, the home environment (<a href="#ct2-8">Chart&#x00A0;2-8</a>), the patient&#x2019;s self-care abilities or the family&#x2019;s ability to provide care, and the patient&#x2019;s need for additional resources. After the assessment, necessary skilled interventions are accomplished. Most agencies provide nurses with bags that contain standard supplies and equipment needed during home visits. It is important to keep the bag properly supplied and to bring any additional items that might be needed for the visit. Depending on insurance coverage, supplies may be delivered to the home or may need to be purchased by the patient. Home health nurses need to be prepared for the inevitability that a patient may not have the medical supplies needed for treatment, and work to procure all needed items.</p>
<p class="indent">One important aspect of the transition from hospital to home is self-management of the medication regimen. Older <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page52" title="52"></span>adults may have multiple prescribers, or may use alternative therapies such as herbal remedies as well as vitamins and other over-the-counter medications. While the patient is under the care of the home health agency, the home health nurse promotes medication management through the process of medication reconciliation. The nurse reviews current medication orders and assists with solving problems or medication discrepancies such as wrong dosages, duplicate medications, omissions, or use of a medication for something other than the prescribed reason (<a href="#bib119">Kollerup, Curtis, &#x0026; Schantz Laursen, 2018</a>). Home health agencies may mandate medication reconciliation at each skilled nursing visit. As patients and families observe medication reconciliation, they begin to understand the importance of medication management. Managing the medication regimen is an important part of a successful transition home; without it, there is risk for readmission to the hospital.</p>

<p class="h8">Determining the Need for Future Visits</p>
<p class="nonindent">While assessing a patient&#x2019;s situation, the home health nurse evaluates and clearly documents the need for future visits and the optimal frequency for those visits. To make these judgments, the nurse should consider the questions listed in <a href="#ct2-9">Chart&#x00A0;2-9</a>. With each subsequent visit, these same factors are evaluated to determine the continuing health needs of the patient. As progress is made and the patient&#x2014;with or without the help of significant others&#x2014;becomes more capable of self-care and more independent, the need for home visits may decline.</p>
<p class="h8">Ending the Visit</p>
<p class="nonindent">As the visit comes to a close, the nurse summarizes the main points of the visit for the patient and family and identifies expectations for future visits or patient achievements. The following points should be considered at the end of each visit:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>What are the main points the patient or family should remember from the visit?</span></li>
<li><span>What positive attributes have been noted about the patient and the family that will give a sense of accomplishment?</span></li>
<li><span>What were the main points of the education plan or the treatments needed to ensure that the patient and family understand what they must do? A written set of instructions should be left with the patient or family, provided they can read and see (alternative formats include video or audio recordings). Printed material must be in the patient&#x2019;s primary language and in large print when indicated.</span></li>
<li><span>Whom should the patient or family call if someone needs to be contacted immediately? Are current emergency telephone numbers readily available? Is telephone service available, or can an emergency phone service be provided?</span></li>
<li><span>What signs of complications should be reported immediately?</span></li>
<li><span>How frequently will visits be made? How long will they last (approximately)?</span></li>
<li><span>What is the day and time of the next visit? Will a different nurse make the visit?</span></li></ul>
<p class="h8">Documenting the Visit</p>
<p class="nonindent">Documentation considerations for home visits follow fairly specific regulations. The patient&#x2019;s needs and the nursing care provided must be documented to ensure that the agency qualifies for payment for the visit. Medicare, Medicaid, and other <strong>third-party payers</strong> (i.e., organizations that provide reimbursement for services covered under a health care insurance plan) require documentation of the patient&#x2019;s homebound status and the need for skilled professional nursing care. The medical diagnosis and specific detailed information on the functional limitations of the patient are usually part of the documentation. The goals and the actions appropriate for attaining those goals must be identified. Expected outcomes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page53" title="53"></span>of the nursing interventions must be stated in terms of patient behaviors and must be realistic and measurable. In addition, the goals must reflect the nursing diagnosis or the patient&#x2019;s problems and must specify those actions that address the patient&#x2019;s problems. Inadequate documentation may result in nonpayment for the visit and care services.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s24">Discharge Planning for Transition to the Community or Home Care Setting</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Discharge planning is an essential component of facilitating the transition of the patient from the acute care to the community or home care setting, or for facilitating the transfer of the patient from one health care setting to another. A documented discharge plan is mandatory for patients who receive Medicare or Medicaid health insurance benefits. Discharge planning begins with the patient&#x2019;s admission to the hospital or health care setting and must consider the potential for necessary follow-up care in the home or another community setting. Several different personnel (e.g., social workers, home health nurses, case managers) or agencies may be involved in the planning process.</p>
<p class="indent">The development of a comprehensive discharge plan requires collaboration between professionals at the referring agency and the home care agency, as well as other community agencies that provide specific resources upon discharge. The process involves identifying the patient&#x2019;s needs and developing a thorough plan to meet them. It is essential to have open lines of communication with family members to ensure understanding and cooperation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s25">Continuing the Transition through Community Resources and Referrals</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Case managers and discharge planners often make referrals to other team members, such as home health aides and social workers. These nurses work collaboratively with the health care team and the referring agency or person. Continuous coordinated care among all health care providers involved in a patient&#x2019;s care is essential to avoid duplication of effort by the various personnel caring for the patient. These nurses must also be knowledgeable about community resources available to patients, as well as services provided by local agencies, eligibility requirements for those services, and any charges for the services (i.e., co-pays). Most communities have directories, which may include online directories or resource booklets, that list local health and social service agencies and their offerings. The Internet is useful in helping patients identify the location and accessibility of grocery and drug stores, banks, health care facilities, ambulances, primary providers, dentists, pharmacists, social service agencies, and senior citizens&#x2019; programs. In addition, a patient&#x2019;s place of worship or faith community may be an important resource for services. The process includes informing the patient and family about the community resources available to meet their needs. When appropriate, nurses may make the initial contact.</p>
<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> An 80-year-old community-dwelling woman with a new diagnosis of heart failure was transferred to your medical-surgical unit from the intensive care unit (ICU). The transfer report from the ICU nurse included the notation that prior to this admission and diagnosis, the patient lived alone at home. The patient has one son who lives locally. Both the patient and son agree with a plan to transition the patient from living alone to living with her son at his home. She has been prescribed new medications to take at home and will need to see her primary provider in 2 weeks. What are your priorities as you work on discharge planning for this patient? What referrals will you consider to achieve a successful transition from hospital to home?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page54" title="54"></span><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> An 82-year-old man newly diagnosed with diabetes is being referred for home care after discharge from the hospital. He needs regular monitoring and diabetes education. He has several family members at home who have assisted with IADLs in the past; however, they all work. You are concerned about his ability to manage his diabetes as his family reports he will be home alone during the day and has decreased activity tolerance related to ADLs since his hospitalization and new diagnosis of diabetes. Identify a specific evidence-based question related to this patient in order to conduct a relevant and focused literature search. What key words would you use in this search, and what sources would be appropriate to search? What resources could you use to assist him to remain in his home for as long as possible? How would you go about obtaining this information? What is the strength of the evidence?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> You are a home health nurse caring for a 75-year-old man who has transitioned home from inpatient rehabilitation following a fall in which his hip was fractured. He had surgery to reduce the fracture and stabilize the hip. He lives with his wife who is also 75 and who has memory impairment. Both need assistance with IADLs. He needs assistance with ADLs as he continues the rehabilitation process at home. As the home health nurse and case manager, develop a list of resources and interdisciplinary services that will enhance this transition to the home setting.</p>
