<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps">Y</span>ou are a nurse working in a community health center that provides services for older adults. A recent needs assessment indicates that patrons of the health center are underutilizing electronic resources available to them. Furthermore, these individuals need education about resources such as their electronic health records (EHRs) including how to access, maintain, and utilize this tool. EHRs enable patients to be more aware and have better control over their health management. You implement a plan for educating older adults in the community on this technology. The main goal of this project is to empower older adults to easily access their own EHRs and manage their appointments, medications, and follow-up visits. An additional goal is that use of this technology will enable patients, families, and communities to have up-to-date information and increased access to health-related resources.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety,</em></strong> and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
<p class="UMTA"><span class="redb"><strong>Patient-Centered Care Definition:</strong></span> Recognize the patient or designee as the source of control and full partner in providing compassionate and coordinated care based on respect for patient&#x2019;s preferences, values, and needs.</p>
