<h4 class="h4" id="s371">Pathophysiology of the Malignant Process</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer is a disease process that begins when a cell is transformed by genetic mutations of the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Genetic mutations may be inherited or acquired, leading to abnormal cell behavior (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). The initial genetically altered cell forms a clone and begins to proliferate abnormally, evading normal intracellular and extracellular growth-regulating processes or signals as well as the immune system defense mechanisms of the body. Genetic mutations may lead to abnormalities in cell signaling transduction processes (signals from outside and within cells that turn cell activities either on or off) that can in turn lead to cancer development. Ultimately cells acquire a variety of capabilities that allow them to invade surrounding tissues or gain access to lymph and blood vessels, which carry the cells to other areas of the body resulting in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;metastasis:&lt;/b&gt; spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant sites">metastasis</button></strong> or spread of the cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Pachmayr, Treese, &#x0026; Stein, 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s372">Carcinogenesis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Understanding the pathophysiology of cancer involves knowledge of the molecular process and proliferation patterns of cancers as well as the numerous etiologic factors that induce the malignant transformation of cells.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Molecular Process</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Malignant transformation, or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;carcinogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; process of transforming normal cells into malignant cells">carcinogenesis</button></strong>, is thought to be at least a three-step cellular process, involving initiation, promotion, and progression (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). Agents that initiate or promote malignant transformation are referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;carcinogens:&lt;/b&gt; chemicals, physical factors, and other agents that cause cancer">carcinogens</button></strong>. A complete carcinogen is an agent that both initiates and promotes the development of cancer (e.g., cigarette smoking, asbestos).</p>
<p class="indent">During <em>initiation,</em> carcinogens (substances that can cause cancer), such as chemicals, physical factors, or biologic agents, cause mutations in the cellular DNA. Normally, these alterations are reversed by DNA repair mechanisms or the changes initiate <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apoptosis:&lt;/b&gt; a normal cell mechanism of programmed cell death">apoptosis</button></strong> (programmed cellular death) or cell senescence. Cells can escape these protective mechanisms with permanent cellular mutations occurring, but these mutations usually are not significant to cells until the second step of carcinogenesis.</p>
<p class="indent">During <em>promotion,</em> repeated exposure to promoting agents (co-carcinogens) causes proliferation and expansion of initiated cells with increased expression or manifestations of abnormal genetic information, even after long latency periods. Promoting agents are not mutagenic and do not need to interact with the DNA. Promotion is reversible if the promoting substance is removed (a key focus in the prevention of cancer). Latency periods for the promotion of cellular mutations vary with the type of agent, the dosage of the promoter, and the innate characteristics and genetic stability of the target cell.</p>
<p class="indent">During <em>progression,</em> the altered cells exhibit increasingly malignant behavior. These cells acquire the ability to stimulate <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;angiogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; growth of new blood vessels that allow cancer cells to grow">angiogenesis</button></strong> (growth of new blood vessels that allow cancer cells to grow), to invade adjacent tissues, and to metastasize. Cellular oncogenes are responsible for vital cell functions, including proliferation and differentiation. Cellular proto-oncogenes, such as those for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), transcription factors such as <em>c-Myc,</em> or cell signaling proteins such as <em>Kirsten ras</em> (<em>KRAS</em>), act as &#x201C;on switches&#x201D; for cellular growth. Amplification of proto-oncogenes or overexpression of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Mutations that increase the activity of oncogenes also deregulate cell proliferation. Genetic alterations in the gene for <em>KRAS</em> have been associated with pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib999">Mainardi, Mulero-S&#x00E1;nchez, Prahallad, et al., 2018</a>). Just as proto-oncogenes &#x201C;turn on&#x201D; cellular growth, cancer suppressor genes &#x201C;turn off,&#x201D; or regulate, unneeded cellular proliferation. When suppressor genes are mutated, resulting in loss of function or expression, the cells begin to produce mutant cell populations that are different from their original cellular ancestors. See <a href="#ct12-1">Chart&#x00A0;12-1</a> for further discussion of genetics concepts and cancer.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s373">Proliferative Patterns</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the lifespan, various body tissues normally undergo periods of rapid or proliferative growth that must be distinguished from malignant growth activity. Several patterns of cellular adaptation include atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia (see <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="c05-sec03.xhtml#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>). Cancerous cells, described as malignant, demonstrate <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neoplasia:&lt;/b&gt; uncontrolled cell growth that follows no physiologic demand; cancer">neoplasia</button></strong>, or uncontrolled cell growth that follows no physiologic demand. Although both benign and malignant growths are classified and named by tissue of origin, the <em>International Classification of Diseases for Oncology</em> (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib976">Fritz, Percy, Jack et al., 2013</a>) is used by scientists and clinicians around the world as the nomenclature for malignant disease (see <a href="#tt12-2">Table&#x00A0;12-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Etiology</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Factors implicated or known to induce carcinogenesis include viruses and bacteria, physical agents, chemicals, genetic or familial factors, lifestyle factors, and hormones. Additional research is needed for a better understanding of the relationships among etiologic factors and cancer.</p>
<p class="h7">Viruses and Bacteria</p>
<p class="nonindent">It is estimated that 10% to 12% of all cancers worldwide are linked to viral infections (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Lunn, Jahnke, &#x0026; Rabkin, 2017</a>). After infecting individuals, DNA viruses insert a part of their own DNA near the infected cell genes causing cell division. The newly formed cells that now carry viral DNA lack normal controls on growth. Examples of these viruses that are known to cause cancer include human papillomavirus (HPV) (cervical and head and neck cancers), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (liver cancer), and Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus (EBV) (Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancer).</p>
<p class="indent">While there is little evidence to support a direct link between most bacteria and cancer, secondary responses to certain bacterial infections, such as the production of carcinogenic metabolites and inflammatory reactions, are suspected mechanisms of cancer development (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1048">van Elsland &#x0026; Neefjes, 2018</a>). Examples of bacteria that are associated with an increased risk of cancer include: <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (stomach cancer), <em>Salmonella enteritidis</em> (colon cancer), and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> (ovarian and cervical cancers).</p>
<p class="h7">Physical Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Physical factors associated with carcinogenesis include exposure to sunlight, radiation, chronic irritation or inflammation, tobacco carcinogens, industrial chemicals, and asbestos (ACS, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Excessive exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun is associated with skin cancers in all individuals, although those with fair-skin are at highest risk. Factors such as clothing styles (sleeveless shirts or shorts), the use of sunscreens, occupation, recreational habits, and environmental variables, including humidity, altitude, and latitude, all play a role in the amount of exposure to ultraviolet light (ACS, 2019c).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Genetics Concepts and Oncologic Disorders</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Cancer is a genetic disease. Every phase of carcinogenesis is affected by multiple gene mutations. Some of these mutations are inherited (present in germ-line cells) and present a greater risk for a person to develop oncologic disorders; however, most (90%) are somatic mutations that are acquired mutations in specific cells. Examples of cancers influenced by genetics include:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Exposure to ionizing radiation from repeated diagnostic x-ray procedures or with radiation therapy used to treat disease can cause cancer (ACS, 2019c). Improved x-ray equipment minimizes the risk of extensive radiation exposure. Radiation therapy used in cancer treatment and exposure to radioactive materials at nuclear weapon manufacturing sites or nuclear power plants in the past have been associated with a higher incidence of leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the breast, thyroid, and other tissues. Background radiation from the natural decay processes that produce radon has also been associated with lung cancer. Ventilation is advised in homes with high levels of trapped radon to allow the gas to disperse into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="h7">Chemical Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Most cancers are thought to be related to environmental factors (ACS, 2019b). Most hazardous chemicals produce their toxic effects by altering DNA structure. This can occur in body sites distant from that of initial chemical exposure.</p>
<p class="indent">Tobacco use is thought to be the single most lethal chemical carcinogen; it accounts for about 30% of all cancer-related deaths (ACS, 2019a). Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with 12 different cancer types including: cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, lung, esophagus, pancreas, uterine cervix, kidney, bladder, stomach, colorectal, liver, and myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), otherwise known as secondhand smoke, has been linked to lung cancer&#x2014;even in people who never smoked (ACS, 2019d). Nonsmokers who were exposed to ETS in the home or workplace have about a 20% to 30% greater risk of developing lung cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib960">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). There is also some evidence that ETS may be linked with cancers of the larynx, pharynx, nasal sinuses, brain, bladder, rectum, stomach, and breast (ACS, 2019d).</p>
<p class="indent">Other combustible forms of tobacco, such as cigars, pipes, roll-your-own products, and water pipes (or hookah), are also associated with increased cancer risk (ACS, 2019d).</p>

<p class="indent">Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah and e-cigars have gained increased popularity as an alternative to tobacco. While ENDS do not contain tobacco, most contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other potentially harmful substances, such as volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, and flavoring chemicals (ACS, 2019d). Given that ENDS are relatively new to the market, the long-term health effects of these products remain unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">Smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco, snuff and snus, used most often by young adults aged 18 to 25 years, are associated with an increased risk of oral, pancreatic, and esophageal cancer (ACS, 2019d; Lipari &#x0026; Van Horn, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Many chemical substances found in the workplace are carcinogens or co-carcinogens (ACS, 2019e). In the United States, carcinogens are classified by two federal agencies: the National Toxicology Program of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency&#x2019;s (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) (CDC, 2017). The CDC established the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to provide occupational exposure limits and guidelines for protection of the workforce as regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (U.S. EPA, 2017). The extensive list of suspected chemical substances continues to grow and includes aromatic amines and aniline dyes; pesticides and formaldehydes; arsenic, soot, and tars; asbestos; benzene; cadmium; chromium compounds; nickel and zinc ores; wood dust; beryllium compounds; and polyvinyl chloride (ACS, 2019e). Betel quid, which are chewed as stimulants in some cultures, are also included (ACS, 2019e; Chen, Mahmood, Mariottini, et al., 2017).</p>
<p class="h7">Genetics and Familial Factors</p>
<p class="nonindent">Almost every cancer type has been shown to run in families. This may be due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Genetic factors play a fundamental role in cancer cell development. Cancer has been associated with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page307" title="307"></span>extra chromosomes, too few chromosomes, or translocated chromosomes (NCI, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately 5% to 10% of cancers in adults display a pattern of cancers suggestive of a familial predisposition (NCI, 2019b). Hereditary cancer syndromes represent a cluster of cancers identified by a specific genetic alteration that is inherited across generations. In these families, the associated genetic mutation is found in all cells in the body (germline mutation) and represents an inherited susceptibility to cancer for all family members who carry the mutation.</p>
<p class="indent">There are more than 50 hereditary syndromes identified by scientists that may predispose individuals to develop certain cancers (NCI, 2019b). The hallmarks of families with a hereditary cancer syndrome include cancer in two or more first-degree relatives (the parent, sibling, or child of an individual), onset of cancer in family members younger than 50 years, the same type of cancer in several family members, individual family members with more than one type of cancer, and a rare cancer in one or more family members. There is also evidence of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of cancers affecting several generations of a family (NCI, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">There have been considerable advances in the recognition of inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes and in the ability to isolate and identify the inherited genetic mutations responsible. These advances have enabled the appropriate identification of families at risk for certain syndromes. Examples include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (<em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>) and multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (<em>MEN1</em> and <em>MEN2</em>) (see <a href="#ct12-1">Chart&#x00A0;12-1</a>). Other cancers associated with familial inheritance syndromes include nephroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and colorectal, stomach, thyroid, renal, prostate, and lung cancers (NCI, 2019b).</p>
<p class="h7">Lifestyle Factors</p>
<p class="nonindent">Lifestyle factors (e.g., obesity, alcohol intake, poor diet, physical inactivity) were estimated to account for 16% of all cancer cases and 18% of all cancer deaths in 2017 (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib986">Islami, Goding Sauer, Miller, et al., 2018</a>). These lifestyle factors were second only to cigarette smoking as a major modifiable risk factor associated with both cancer development and cancer mortality.</p>
<p class="indent">The risk of cancer increases with long-term ingestion of carcinogens or co-carcinogens or the absence of protective substances in the diet. Dietary substances that appear to increase the risk of cancer include fats, alcohol, salt-cured or smoked meats, nitrate- and nitrite-containing foods, and red and processed meats (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1058">World Cancer Research Fund [WCRF], 2018</a>). Heavy alcohol use increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colon, rectum, and breast (WCRF, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Obesity has been linked to the development of cancers of the breast (in postmenopausal women), colon and rectum, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, and pancreas (WCRF, 2018). Obesity may be also associated with an increased risk for cancers of the gallbladder, liver, ovary, and cervix, and for multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and aggressive forms of prostate cancer. While there is a clear relationship between obesity and cancer, the etiology of cancer in the context of obesity remains poorly understood (NCI, 2017). Several possible mechanisms have been suggested, however, including that excess fat may cause chronic inflammation resulting in DNA damage, increased levels of certain hormones (e.g., estrogen, insulin, adipokines), and disruptions in levels of cell growth regulators (e.g., mammalian target of rapamycin and AMP-activated protein kinase)&#x2014;all of which may increase the development of certain types of cancer. Multiple studies have long linked a sedentary lifestyle and lack of regular exercise to cancer development (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib958">Cannioto, Etter, Guterman, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib959">Cannioto, Etter, LaMonte, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hormonal Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Tumor growth may be promoted by disturbances in hormonal balance, either by the body&#x2019;s own (endogenous) hormone production or by administration of exogenous hormones (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). Cancers of the breast, prostate, ovaries, and endometrium are thought to depend on endogenous hormonal levels for growth. Prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen) has long been recognized as a risk factor for clear cell adenocarcinoma of the lower genital tract (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib985">Huo, Anderson, Palmer, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hormonal changes related to the female reproductive cycle are also associated with cancer incidence. Early onset of menses before age 12 and delayed onset of menopause after age 55, null parity (never giving birth), and delayed childbirth after age 30 are all associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Chen, 2019</a>). Increased numbers of pregnancies are associated with a decreased incidence of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.</p>
<p class="indent">Women who take estrogen after menopause appear to have a decreased risk of breast cancer, but an increased risk of developing endometrial cancers (NCI, 2018). Thus, estrogen replacement alone is not used in women who have not had a hysterectomy. Combination estrogen and progesterone therapy is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer. The longer the combined therapy is used, the higher the risk of developing breast cancer. However, the risk substantially decreases when therapy is discontinued (NCI, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s374">Role of the Immune System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In humans, transformed cells arise on a regular basis, but are recognized by surveillance cells of the immune system that destroy them before cell growth becomes uncontrolled (immune surveillance) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). When the immune system fails to identify and stop the growth of transformed cells, a tumor can develop and progress.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are immunocompromised have an increased incidence of cancer. Transplant recipients who receive immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ have an increased incidence of cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an increased incidence of Kaposi sarcoma and other cancers. Patients who were previously treated for one cancer are at increased risk for secondary cancers (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Normal Immune Responses</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Through the process of immune surveillance, an intact immune system usually has the ability to recognize and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page308" title="308"></span>combat cancer cells through multiple, interacting cells and actions of the innate, humoral, and cellular components of the immune system (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib926">Jameson, Fauci, Kasper, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs; also called <em>tumor cell antigens</em>) are found on the membranes of many cancer cells. TAAs are processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells [very specialized cells of the immune system] that present antigens to both T and B lymphocytes) and are presented to T lymphocytes that recognize the antigen-bearing cells as foreign. Multiple TAAs have been identified&#x2014;some are found in many types of cancer, some exist in the normal tissues of origin as well as the cancer cells, some exist in both normal and cancer cells but are overexpressed (exist in higher concentrations) in cancer cells, and others are very specific to certain cancer types (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In response to recognizing TAAs as foreign, T lymphocytes release several cytokines that elicit various immune system actions, including (1) proliferation of cytotoxic (cell-killing) T lymphocytes capable of direct destruction of cancer cells, (2) induction of cancer cell apoptosis, and (3) recruitment of additional immune system cells (B-cell lymphocytes that produce antibodies, natural killer cells, and macrophages) that contribute to the destruction and degradation of cancer cells (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jameson et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Immune System Evasion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several theories postulate how malignant cells survive and proliferate, evading the elaborate immune system defense mechanisms (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jameson et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). If the body fails to recognize the TAAs on cancer cells or the function of the APCs is impaired, the immune response is not stimulated. Some cancer cells have been found to have altered cell membranes that interfere with APC binding and presentation to T lymphocytes. Tumors can also express molecules that induce T-lymphocyte anergy or tolerance such as PD-1 ligand. These molecules bind to PD-1 proteins on T lymphocytes and either block the killing of the tumor or induce cell death in the lymphocyte. In addition, cancer cells have been found to release cytokines that inhibit APCs as well as other cells of the immune system. When tumors do not possess TAAs that label them as foreign, the immune response is not alerted. This allows the tumor to grow too large to be managed by normal immune mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent">The immunogenicity (immunologic appearance) of cancer cells can be altered through genetic mutations, allowing the cells to evade immune cell recognition (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). Conversely, mutations are the source for some TAAs. Tumor antigens may combine with the antibodies produced by the immune system and hide or disguise themselves from normal immune defense mechanisms. The tumor antigen&#x2013;antibody complexes that evade recognition lead to a false message to decrease further production of antibodies as well as other immune system components.</p>
<p class="indent">Overexpression (abnormally high concentrations) of host suppressor T lymphocytes induced through the release of cytokines by malignant cells is thought to downregulate the immune response, thus permitting uncontrolled cell growth (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jameson et al., 2018</a>). Suppressor T lymphocytes normally assist in regulating lymphocyte production and diminishing immune responses (e.g., antibody production) when they are no longer required. Low levels of antibodies and high levels of suppressor cells have been found in patients with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer associated with hypogammaglobulinemia (low amounts of serum antibodies). Conversely, there is evidence that proliferation of helper T lymphocytes, which promote the immune response, is impaired by cytokines produced by cancer cells (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jameson et al., 2018</a>). Without helper T lymphocytes, the immune system response is limited, and the cancer cells continue to proliferate. Understanding the role of the immune system and identification of the ways in which cancer evades the body&#x2019;s natural defenses provide the foundation for therapeutic approaches that seek to support and enhance the immune system&#x2019;s role in combating cancer (see <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>).</p>
