It is generally recommended for patients who have positive lymph nodes or who have invasive tumors greater than 1 cm in size, regardless of nodal status. It is considered in patients with smaller tumors; involvement of lymph nodes affects the decision-making process (NCCN, 2019). <span class="chart"><a href="#tt52-6">Table&#x00A0;52-6</a></span> outlines general indications for adjuvant chemotherapy. A survival benefit has been shown in both women who are pre- and postmenopausal and who have received chemotherapy, although data are limited in women older than 70 years. Chemotherapy is most commonly initiated after breast surgery and before radiation. Preoperative therapy may be considered in order to shrink tumor size to support breast conservation (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Telli, 2018</a>). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (cancer that tests negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and excess HER2 protein) who delay initiation of chemotherapy beyond 30 days postsurgery have an increased risk of recurrence (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">DePolo, 2018</a>). Nurses encourage and assist in facilitating timely treatment to optimize outcomes.</p>

<p class="tablesource"><em>Note:</em> These are only general guidelines. Recommendations may vary depending on factors such as prognostic variables, patient age, and comorbid conditions.</p>
<p class="tablesource">Adapted from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). (2019). Clinical practice guidelines: Breast. Retrieved on 9/9/2019 at: <a href="http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/breast_risk.pdf">www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/breast_risk.pdf</a></p>

<p class="indent">Chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer combine several agents (polychemotherapy), generally given over a period of 3 to 6 months. Decisions regarding the optimal regimen are based on a variety of factors, including tumor characteristics (i.e., tumor size, lymph node status, hormone receptor status, HER-2/neu status) and the patient&#x2019;s age, physical status, and existing comorbid conditions. A regimen that includes <strong><em>c</em></strong>yclophosphamide, <strong><em>m</em></strong>ethotrexate, and <strong><em>f</em></strong>luorouracil (collectively referred to as CMF) has been the most widely used adjuvant therapy. It is usually well tolerated and may be considered for patients with a low risk of recurrence. CMF also may be considered for use in patients who have a high risk of cardiac toxicity or who have other limiting comorbidities. Anthracycline-based regimens (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin) have shown longer survival in patients. However, the benefit relative to CMF is modest and is accompanied by increased toxicity, especially to the bone marrow (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Santa-Maria &#x0026; Gradishar, 2018</a>). Selection of patients most likely to benefit from anthracycline therapy would allow better use of current cytotoxic agents and reduce the risk of patients receiving toxicity with little or no effect. <strong><em>C</em></strong>yclophosphamide, <strong><em>d</em></strong>oxorubicin (trade name <strong><em>A</em></strong>driamycin), and <strong>f</strong>luorouracil (CAF) and <strong><em>d</em></strong>oxorubicin and <strong><em>c</em></strong>yclophosphamide (AC) are examples of the trade names of combination regimens often given to patients who are at high risk. Identifying biomarkers that can accurately predict benefit from specific chemotherapeutic agents will also highlight key resistance/susceptibility pathways that can then be exploited clinically to further increase efficacy and ensure timely treatment (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Korourian, Kumarapeli, &#x0026; Klimberg, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) are generally incorporated into treatment regimens for patients with larger, node-negative cancers and for those with positive axillary lymph nodes. The addition of four cycles of paclitaxel after a standard course of AC has been found to increase the disease-free period and improve overall survival in patients with operable breast cancer and positive lymph nodes (NCCN, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Much attention has been focused on <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dose-dense chemotherapy:&lt;/b&gt; administration of chemotherapeutic agents at standard doses with shorter time intervals between each cycle of treatment">dose-dense chemotherapy</button></strong>, which is the administration of chemotherapeutic agents at standard doses with shorter time intervals between each cycle of treatment. Cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy during rapid growth phase, so more frequent doses kill more cancer cells than increased doses (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Santa-Maria &#x0026; Gradishar, 2018</a>). Dose density is standard of care with some breast cancers, but is still controversial with estrogen-receptor positive disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2469">Side Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many of the side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy can be managed well, allowing patients to maintain their daily routines and work schedules. In large part, this is the result of the meticulous educational and psychological preparation provided to patients and their families by oncology nurses, oncologists, social workers, and other members of the health care team. In addition, strides have been made in the effectiveness of antiemetic agents used to alleviate nausea and vomiting and the use of hematopoietic growth factors to treat neutropenia and anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Common physical side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer may include nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, taste changes, alopecia (hair loss), mucositis, neuropathy, skin changes, and fatigue. A weight gain of more than 10 lb occurs in about half of all patients; the cause is unknown. Women who are premenopausal may also experience temporary or permanent amenorrhea.</p>
<p class="indent">Specific side effects vary with the type of chemotherapeutic agent used. In general, CMF and the taxanes are better tolerated than the anthracyclines. However, the taxanes can cause peripheral neuropathy, arthralgias, and myalgias, particularly at high doses. During taxane administration, hypersensitivity reactions may occur; therefore, the patient must be premedicated with corticosteroids and antihistamines. Alopecia is also common. The side effects of the anthracyclines may be severe and include cardiotoxicity in addition to nausea and vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and alopecia. Their vesicant properties can lead to tissue necrosis if infiltration of the medication infusion occurs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2470">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses play an important role in helping patients manage the physical and psychosocial sequelae of chemotherapy. (<a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> provides an in-depth discussion of side effect management.) Educating the patient about the use of antiemetic agents and reviewing the optimal dosage schedule can help minimize nausea and vomiting. The different classes of antiemetic agents include serotonin (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists (palonosetron, granisetron, ondansetron); neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant); dopamine receptor antagonists (prochlorperazine, metoclopramide); benzodiazepines (lorazepam); and corticosteroids (dexamethasone). Measures to ease the symptoms of mucositis may include rinsing with normal saline or sodium bicarbonate solution, avoiding hot and spicy foods, and using a soft toothbrush.</p>

<p class="indent">Some patients may require hematopoietic growth factors to minimize the effects of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and anemia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors boost the white blood cell count, helping to reduce the incidence of neutropenic fever and infection. The short-acting form, filgrastim, is injected subcutaneously or IV for 7 to 10 days after chemotherapy administration. The long-acting form, pegfilgrastim, is injected once, no earlier than 24 hours after chemotherapy (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2018</a>). Erythropoietin growth factor increases the production of red blood cells, thus decreasing the symptoms of anemia. The short-acting form, epoetin alfa is usually given weekly. The long-acting form, darbepoetin alfa, can be given every 2 to 3 weeks. The nurse instructs the patient and family on proper injection technique of hematopoietic growth factors and about symptoms that require follow-up with a primary provider (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-10">Chart&#x00A0;52-10</a></span>).</p>
<p class="indent">To prevent some of the emotional trauma associated with alopecia, it often helps to have a patient obtain a wig before hair loss begins to occur. The nurse may provide a list of wig suppliers in the patient&#x2019;s geographic region. Familiarity with creative ways to use scarves and turbans may also help minimize the patient&#x2019;s distress. The patient needs reassurance that new hair will grow back when treatment is completed, although the color and texture may be different. The ACS offers the Look Good Feel Better program, which provides useful tips for applying cosmetics during the period a patient is receiving chemotherapy (see Resources section).</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapy may negatively affect the patient&#x2019;s self-esteem, sexuality, and sense of well-being. This, combined with the stress of a potentially life-threatening disease, can be acute. Providing support and promoting open communication are important aspects of nursing care. Referring the patient to the dietitian, social worker, psychiatrist, or spiritual advisor can provide additional support. Numerous community support and advocacy groups are available for patients and their families. Complementary therapies, such as guided imagery, meditation, and relaxation exercises, can also be used in conjunction with conventional treatments.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2471">Hormonal Therapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The use of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adjuvant hormonal therapy:&lt;/b&gt; the use of synthetic hormones or other medications given after primary treatment to increase the chances of a cure by stopping or slowing the growth of certain cancers that are affected by hormone stimulation, also called endocrine or antiestrogen therapy">adjuvant hormonal therapy</button></strong>, with or without the addition of chemotherapy, is considered in women who have hormone receptor&#x2013;positive tumors. Its use can be determined by the results of an estrogen and progesterone receptor assay (a test to determine whether the breast tumor is nourished by hormones). About two thirds of breast cancers depend on estrogen for growth and express a nuclear receptor that binds to the estrogen; thus, they are estrogen receptor positive (ER+). Similarly, tumors that express the progesterone receptor are progesterone receptor positive (PR+). Hormonal therapy involves the use of synthetic hormones or other medications that compete with estrogen by binding to the receptor sites (SERMs), or the use of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aromatase inhibitors:&lt;/b&gt; medications that block the production of estrogens by the adrenal glands">aromatase inhibitors</button></strong>, which block estrogen production by the adrenal glands. In general, tumors that are ER+/PR+ have the greatest likelihood of responding to hormonal therapy and have a more favorable prognosis than those that are ER&#x2212;/PR&#x2212;. Women who are pre- and perimenopausal are more likely to have non&#x2013;hormone-dependent lesions, whereas women who are postmenopausal are more likely to have hormone-dependent lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, the SERM tamoxifen has been the main hormonal agent used in treatment of pre- and postmenopausal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1734" title="1734"></span>breast cancer and remains the mainstay in women who are premenopausal. As an SERM, tamoxifen has estrogen antagonistic (estrogen-blocking) and agonistic (estrogenlike) effects on certain tissues. Its antagonistic effects in the breast prevent estrogen from binding to the receptor sites, thus preventing tumor growth. Tamoxifen has positive agonistic effects on blood lipid profiles and bone mineral density in women who are postmenopausal. It also has agonistic effects on endometrial tissue and blood coagulation processes, leading to an increased incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis [DVT], superficial phlebitis, pulmonary embolism). Nevertheless, the benefits in most women with breast cancer outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="indent">The aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are important components in the hormonal management of women who are postmenopausal. Most of the circulating estrogens in women who are postmenopausal are derived from the conversion of the adrenal androgen androstenedione to estrone and the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Aromatase inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme aromatase from performing the conversion, thereby decreasing the level of circulating estrogen in peripheral tissues. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the aromatase inhibitors are superior to tamoxifen in terms of overall response rate and clinical benefit and that inhibitors appear to be effective and feasible compared with tamoxifen as first-line hormonal therapy in women who are postmenopausal with advanced breast cancer (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Santa-Maria &#x0026; Gradishar, 2018</a>). These data ensure that aromatase inhibitors will play an increasingly central role in the long-term management of breast cancer. Trials are ongoing to determine the optimal treatment regimen and the timing of the treatment; possible eligibility for a clinical trial should be discussed between the patient and the care team. <span class="chart"><a href="#tt52-7">Table&#x00A0;52-7</a></span> outlines the adverse effects of adjuvant hormonal therapy. <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-11">Chart&#x00A0;52-11</a></span> outlines appropriate patient education to manage the adverse effects.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2472">Targeted Therapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An exciting area of research in the systemic treatment of breast cancer involves the use of targeted therapies. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;HER-2/neu:&lt;/b&gt; a protein that, when found in larger amounts, indicates an aggressive tumor">HER-2/neu</button></strong> protein. This protein, which regulates cell growth, is present in small amounts on the surface of normal breast cells and in most breast cancers. Approximately 20% of tumors overexpress (overproduce) the HER-2/neu protein and are associated with rapid growth and poor prognosis (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3793">Mayo Clinic, 2020</a>). Trastuzumab targets and inactivates the HER-2/neu protein, thus slowing tumor growth.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike chemotherapy, trastuzumab spares the normal cells and has limited adverse reactions, which may include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. However, when trastuzumab is given to patients who have previously been treated with an anthracycline, the risk of cardiac toxicity is increased. The medication has been shown to improve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1735" title="1735"></span>survival rates in women with HER-2/neu&#x2013;positive metastatic breast cancer and is now regarded as standard therapy. Recently, three other HER2-targeting agents have entered routine clinical practice. These include a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (lapatinib) and two novel HER2-targeting monoclonal antibodies (pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine). Assessing the benefits and risks of these medications is complex, and medical oncologists often use a variety of aids in their decision making (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Sledge, 2018</a>).</p>
