<h4 class="h4" id="s1986">Hypoparathyroidism</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoparathyroidism is caused by abnormal parathyroid development, destruction of the parathyroid glands (surgical removal or autoimmune response), and vitamin D deficiency. The most common cause is the near-total removal of the thyroid gland. The result is inadequate secretion of parathormone (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Goltzman, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Deficiency of parathormone results in hyperphosphatemia (increased blood phosphate levels) and hypocalcemia (decreased blood calcium levels). In the absence of parathormone, there is decreased intestinal absorption of dietary calcium and decreased resorption of calcium from bone and through the renal tubules. Decreased renal excretion of phosphate causes hypophosphaturia, and low serum calcium levels result in hypocalciuria.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1987">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypocalcemia causes irritability of the neuromuscular system and contributes to the chief symptom of hypoparathyroidism&#x2014;tetany. Tetany is general muscle hypertonia, with tremor and spasmodic or uncoordinated contractions occurring with or without efforts to make voluntary movements. Symptoms of latent tetany are numbness, tingling, and cramps <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1473" title="1473"></span>in the extremities, and the patient complains of stiffness in the hands and feet. In overt tetany, the signs include bronchospasm, laryngeal spasm, carpopedal spasm (flexion of the elbows and wrists and extension of the carpophalangeal joints and dorsiflexion of the feet), dysphagia, photophobia, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. Other symptoms include anxiety, irritability, depression, and even delirium. ECG changes and hypotension also may occur.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1988">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A positive Chvostek sign or a positive Trousseau sign suggests latent tetany. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Chvostek sign:&lt;/b&gt; spasm of the facial muscles produced by sharply tapping over the facial nerve in front of the parotid gland and anterior to the ear; suggestive of latent tetany in patients with hypocalcemia">Chvostek sign</button></strong> is positive when a sharp tapping over the facial nerve just in front of the parotid gland and anterior to the ear causes spasm or twitching of the mouth, nose, and eye (see <a href="c10-sec06.xhtml#ff10-8">Fig. 10-8</a>A). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Trousseau sign:&lt;/b&gt; carpopedal spasm induced when blood flow to the arm is occluded using a blood pressure cuff or tourniquet, causing ischemia to the distal nerves; suggestive sign for latent tetany in hypocalcemia">Trousseau sign</button></strong> is positive when carpopedal spasm is induced by occluding the blood flow to the arm for 3 minutes with a blood pressure cuff (see <a href="c10-sec06.xhtml#ff10-8">Fig. 10-8</a>B). The diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism often is difficult because of the vague symptoms, such as aches and pains. Therefore, laboratory studies are especially helpful. Tetany develops at very low serum calcium levels. Serum phosphate levels are increased, and x-rays of bone show increased density. Calcification is detected on x-rays of the subcutaneous or paraspinal basal ganglia of the brain.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1989">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of therapy is to increase the serum calcium level to 9 to 10 mg/dL (2.2 to 2.5 mmol/L) and to eliminate the symptoms of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. Management is determined by the underlying cause and patient profile. Treatment may include combinations of calcium, magnesium, and ergocalciferol or calcitriol, the latter being preferred. A thiazide diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) may be given to help decrease urinary calcium excretion (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Goltzman, 2019</a>). Recombinant parathyroid hormone has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis but not for hypoparathyroidism at this time (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Goltzman, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When hypocalcemia and tetany occur after a thyroidectomy, the immediate treatment is administration of IV calcium gluconate. If this does not decrease neuromuscular irritability and seizure activity immediately, sedative agents such as pentobarbital may be given.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of neuromuscular irritability, the patient with hypocalcemia and tetany requires an environment that is free of noise, drafts, bright lights, or sudden movement. If the patient develops respiratory distress, a tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation may become necessary, along with medications that cause bronchodilation in order to provide respiratory support.</p>
<p class="indent">Therapy for chronic hypoparathyroidism is determined after serum calcium levels are obtained. A diet high in calcium and low in phosphorus is prescribed. Although milk, milk products, and egg yolk are high in calcium, they are restricted because they also contain high levels of phosphorus. Spinach also is avoided because it contains oxalate, which would form insoluble calcium substances. Oral tablets of calcium salts, such as calcium gluconate, may be used to supplement the diet. Aluminum hydroxide gel or aluminum carbonate also is given after meals to bind phosphate and promote its excretion through the GI tract.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1990">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of the patient with possible acute hypoparathyroidism includes the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Care of postoperative patients who have undergone thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, or radical neck dissection is directed toward detecting early signs of hypocalcemia and anticipating signs of tetany, seizures, and respiratory difficulties.</span></li>
<li><span>Calcium gluconate should be available for emergency IV administration. If the patient requiring administration of calcium gluconate has a cardiac disorder, is subject to arrhythmias, or is receiving digitalis, the calcium gluconate is given slowly and cautiously.</span></li>
<li><span>Calcium and digitalis increase systolic contraction and also potentiate each other; this can produce potentially fatal arrhythmias. Consequently, the cardiac patient requires continuous cardiac monitoring and careful assessment.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">An important aspect of nursing care is patient education about medications and diet therapy. The patient needs to know the reason for high calcium and low phosphate intake and the symptoms of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia; they should know to contact the primary provider immediately if these symptoms occur (see <a href="#ct45-10">Chart 45-10</a>).</p>
