<p class="nonindent">Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) collectively make up the condition called <strong>venous thromboembolism (VTE).</strong> The annual incidence of VTE is estimated at 1 to 2 per 1000 population (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1956">Pe&#x00F1;aloza-Mart&#x00ED;nez, Demelo-Rodr&#x00ED;guez, Proietti, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Serhal &#x0026; Barnes, 2019</a>). The incidence of VTE is 10% to 20% in general medical patients and up to 80% in critically ill patients. VTE is frequently not diagnosed because DVT and PE are often clinically silent or asymptomatic. It is estimated that as many as 30% of patients hospitalized with VTE develop long-term postthrombotic complications. In surgical patients, most symptomatic thromboembolic complications occur after hospital discharge due to shorter lengths of stay (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1966">Stubbs, Assareh, Curnow, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1011"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An underlying cause of death in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been linked to VTE or primary pulmonary thrombi. The majority of patients who are severely ill with COVID-19 have a markedly elevated D-dimer assay (blood test for evidence of blood clots) and a presumed prothrombotic state. Because of this, routine thromboprophylaxis of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is recommended regardless of their risk score (see later discussion) (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1951">Obi, Barnes, Wakefield, et al., 2020</a>). The systemic inflammatory changes in the vascular system in patients with COVID-19 likely contribute to thrombosis, hemodynamic instability, and autonomic dysregulation. Early reports suggest long-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 may include accelerated atherosclerosis, VTE, arterial thromboembolic disease, and aortic aneurysm formation (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Becker, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1012">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Superficial veins, such as the greater saphenous, short saphenous (also known as lesser saphenous), cephalic, basilic, and external jugular veins, are thick-walled muscular structures that lie just under the skin. In contrast, deep veins are thin walled and have less muscle in the media. Deep veins run parallel to arteries and bear the same names as the arteries. Deep and superficial veins have valves that permit unidirectional flow back to the heart. The valves lie at the base of a segment of vein that is expanded into a sinus. This arrangement enables the valves to open without coming into contact with the wall of the vein, thus permitting rapid closure when the blood starts to flow backward. Other types of veins are known as perforating veins. These veins have valves that allow one-way blood flow from the superficial venous system to the deep venous system.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the exact cause of VTE remains unclear, three factors, known as Virchow triad, are believed to play a significant role in its development: endothelial damage, venous stasis, and altered coagulation (see <a href="#ct26-8">Chart 26-8</a>). Damage to the intimal lining of blood vessels creates a site for clot formation. Direct trauma to the veins may occur with fractures or dislocation, diseases of the veins, and chemical irritation of the vein from IV medications or solutions. Venous stasis occurs when blood flow is reduced, as in heart failure or shock; when veins are dilated, as an effect of some medication therapies; and when skeletal muscle contraction is reduced, as in immobility, paralysis of the extremities, or anesthesia. Altered coagulation occurs most commonly in patients for whom anticoagulant medications have been abruptly withdrawn. Oral contraceptive use, elevated CRP levels (Cauci, Francescato, Colannino, et al., 2020), and several blood dyscrasias (abnormalities) also can lead to hypercoagulability, with prevalence depending on the ethnicity of the patient. For example, factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation is more prevalent in White persons, whereas antithrombin III deficiency, protein C deficiency, and protein S deficiency are found more commonly in patients of Southeast Asian descent (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). An increase in factor VIII concentrations is more common among African Americans (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1931">Folsom, Basu, Hong, et al., 2019</a>). Pregnancy is also considered a hypercoagulable state, as it is accompanied by an increase in circulating clotting factors that may not return to baseline until longer than 6 weeks postpartum, increasing the risk of thrombosis. In addition, during pregnancy there is a 50% decrease in venous outflow due to hormonally decreased venous capacitance and reduced venous outflow due to compression from the uterus (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1976">Zheng, Chen, Fu, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6" id="s3315">Deep Vein Thrombosis</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</strong> refers to thrombus formation in the deep veins, usually in the thigh or calf, but sometimes in the arm (e.g., patients with peripherally inserted central catheters).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1013">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Formation of a thrombus frequently accompanies phlebitis, which is an inflammation of the vein walls. When a thrombus develops initially in the veins as a result of stasis or hypercoagulability but without inflammation, the process is referred to as phlebothrombosis. Venous thrombosis can occur in any vein, but it occurs more often in the veins of the lower extremities. The superficial and deep veins of the extremities may be affected.</p>
<p class="indent">Upper extremity venous thrombosis accounts for 5% to 10% of all cases of DVT, but its incidence may be as high as 93% in the presence of central venous cannulation or upper extremity compression (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Mintz &#x0026; Levy, 2017</a>). It typically involves more than one venous segment, with the subclavian vein the most frequently affected. In addition, upper extremity venous thrombosis is more common in patients with IV catheters or in patients with an underlying disease that causes hypercoagulability, such as cancer. Internal trauma to the vessels may result from pacemaker leads, chemotherapy ports, dialysis catheters, or parenteral nutrition lines. The lumen of the vein may be decreased as a result of the catheter or from external compression, such as by neoplasms or an extra cervical rib. Effort thrombosis, also known as Paget&#x2013;Schroetter syndrome, of the upper extremity is caused by repetitive motion (e.g., as seen in competitive swimmers, tennis players, baseball players, weight lifters, or construction workers) that irritates the vessel wall, causing inflammation and subsequent thrombosis and is a manifestation of venous thoracic outlet syndrome where the veins becomes distorted and narrowed (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Venous thrombi are aggregates of platelets attached to the vein wall that have a tail-like appendage containing fibrin, white blood cells, and many red blood cells. The &#x201C;tail&#x201D; can grow or can propagate in the direction of blood flow as successive layers of the thrombus form. A propagating venous thrombosis is dangerous because parts of the thrombus can break off and occlude the pulmonary blood vessels. Fragmentation of the thrombus can occur spontaneously as it dissolves naturally, or it can occur with an elevated venous pressure, as may occur after standing suddenly or engaging in muscular activity after prolonged inactivity. After an episode of acute DVT, reestablishment of the lumen of the vessel, or recanalization, typically occurs. Lack of recanalization within the first 6 months after DVT appears to be an important predictor of postthrombotic syndrome, which is one complication of venous thrombosis (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>) (see later discussion). Other complications of venous thrombosis are listed in <a href="#ct26-9">Chart 26-9</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1014">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A major challenge in recognizing DVT is that the signs and symptoms are nonspecific. The exception is phlegmasia cerulea dolens (massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis), in which the entire extremity becomes massively swollen, tense, painful, and cool to the touch. The large DVT creates severe and sudden venous hypertension that leads to tissue ischemia with resultant translocation of fluid into the interstitial space. Venous gangrene occurs in 20% to 50% of cases and is associated with poor survival (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Deep Veins</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations of obstruction of the deep veins include edema and swelling of the extremity because the outflow of venous blood is inhibited. The affected extremity may feel warmer than the unaffected extremity, and the superficial veins may appear more prominent. Tenderness, which usually occurs later, is produced by inflammation of the vein wall and can be detected by gently palpating the affected extremity. In some cases, signs and symptoms of a PE are the first indication of DVT.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Superficial Veins</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Thrombosis of superficial veins, or superficial thrombophlebitis, produces pain or tenderness, redness, and warmth in the involved area. The risk of the superficial venous thrombi becoming dislodged or fragmenting into emboli is very low because most of them dissolve spontaneously. This condition can be treated at home with bed rest, elevation of the leg, analgesic agents, and possibly, anti-inflammatory medication.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1015">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Careful assessment is invaluable in detecting early signs of venous disorders of the lower extremities (see <a href="#ct26-8">Chart 26-8</a>). Diagnostic tests for VTE include laboratory and venous duplex studies. Laboratory tests are conducted to determine baseline levels and include complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies that include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). If an underlying hypercoagulable state is suspected, additional laboratory testing may include CRP, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Duplex ultrasound findings may show veins that appear larger than normal with thrombus formation or veins that are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page847" title="847"></span>incompressible and dilated. The thrombus may appear to be adherent to the vein wall or mobile with a thrombus tail.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1016">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with a prior history of VTE are at increased risk of a new episode; the rate of recurrence can be as high as 13.7% in men and 14.1% in women (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Serhal &#x0026; Barnes, 2019</a>). VTE can be prevented, especially if patients who are considered at high risk are identified and preventive measures are instituted without delay. Preventive measures include encouragement of early ambulation and leg exercises, the application of graduated compression stockings, and the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices (see later discussion). An additional method to prevent venous thrombosis in surgical patients is administration of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Patients should be advised to make lifestyle changes as appropriate, which may include weight loss, smoking cessation, and regular exercise.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1017">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of treatment for DVT are to prevent the thrombus from extending and fragmenting (thus risking PE), recurrent thromboemboli, and postthrombotic syndrome (discussed later in the chapter) (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1956">Pe&#x00F1;aloza-Mart&#x00ED;nez et al., 2018</a>). Anticoagulant therapy involves the administration of a medication to delay the clotting time of blood, prevent the formation of a thrombus in postoperative patients, and forestall the extension of a thrombus after it has formed; it can be used to meet the treatment goals for DVT (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1975">Witt, Nieuwlaat, Clark, et al., 2018</a>). However, anticoagulant agents cannot dissolve a thrombus that has already formed. Combining anticoagulation with mechanical thrombectomy and ultrasound-guided thrombolytic therapy may eliminate venous obstruction, maintain venous patency, and prevent postthrombotic syndrome by early removal of the thrombus (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1944">Kruger, Eikelboom, Douketis, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medications for preventing or reducing blood clotting within the vascular system are indicated in patients diagnosed with DVT. These medications are also indicated for patients with thrombophlebitis, recurrent embolus formation, persistent leg edema from heart failure, and in select patients who must be immobilized for a protracted time (e.g., older adults with hip fractures). The primary pharmacologic treatment for the prevention and management of DVT is anticoagulant therapy which consists of vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin), indirect and direct thrombin inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors (see <a href="#tt26-2">Table 26-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endovascular Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Endovascular management is necessary for DVT when anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated, the danger of PE is extreme, or venous drainage is so severely compromised that permanent damage to the extremity is likely. A thrombectomy may be necessary. This mechanical method of clot removal may involve using intraluminal catheters with a balloon or other devices. Some of these spin to break the clot, and others use oscillation to break up the clot to facilitate removal. Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis may be another option. This intervention uses bursts or continuous high-frequency ultrasound waves emanating from the catheters to cause cavitation of the thrombus, making it more permeable to the thrombolytic agent (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Kruger et al., 2019</a>). A vena cava filter may be placed at the time of the thrombectomy or thrombolysis; this filter traps large emboli and prevents PE (see later discussion). Retrievable caval filters can be left in place and retrieved up to 6 months after placement. In patients with chronic iliac vein compression (e.g., as is seen in May&#x2013;Thurner syndrome), balloon angioplasty with stent placement may successfully treat the patient&#x2019;s chronic leg symptoms (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Ignatyev, Pokrovsky, &#x0026; Gradusov, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1018">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When performing the nursing assessment, key concerns include limb pain, a feeling of heaviness, functional impairment, ankle engorgement, and edema; increase in the surface temperature of the leg, particularly the calf or ankle; and areas of tenderness or superficial thrombosis (i.e., cordlike venous segment). The amount of swelling in the extremity can be determined by measuring the circumference of the affected extremity at various levels (i.e., thigh to ankle) with a tape measure and comparing one extremity with the other at the same level to determine size differences. If both extremities are swollen, a size difference may be difficult to detect. Homan sign (pain in the calf after the foot is sharply dorsiflexed) is <em>not</em> a reliable sign of DVT because it can be elicited in any painful condition of the calf and has no clinical value in assessment for DVT.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing and Monitoring Anticoagulant Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, the nurse monitors laboratory values as indicated. The aPTT, PT, INR, ACT, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels can be affected, depending on the anticoagulant prescribed; baseline assessments before the initiation of therapy should be performed. Close observation is required to detect bleeding; if bleeding occurs, it must be reported immediately and anticoagulant therapy reversed or discontinued if appropriate (see <a href="#tt26-2">Table 26-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Potential complications of anticoagulant therapy consist of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and drug&#x2013;drug interactions. The nurse should monitor for these potential complications, be familiar with medications approved to reverse effects of various anticoagulants, and educate patients and caregivers on ways to reduce these potential risks (see <a href="#tt26-2">Table 26-2</a> and <a href="#ct26-10">Chart 26-10</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Discomfort</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Elevation of the affected extremity, graduated compression stockings (see later discussion), and analgesic agents for pain relief are adjuncts to therapy. They help improve circulation and increase comfort. Warm packs applied to the affected extremity reduce the discomfort associated with DVT.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Positioning the Body and Encouraging Exercise</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient is on bed rest, the feet and lower legs should be elevated periodically above the level of the heart. This position allows the superficial and tibial veins to empty rapidly and to remain collapsed. Active and passive leg exercises, particularly those involving calf muscles, should be performed to increase venous flow. Early ambulation is most effective in preventing venous stasis. The patient is encouraged to walk once anticoagulation therapy has been initiated and is advised that walking is better than standing or sitting for long periods. Once ambulatory, the patient is instructed to avoid sitting for more than an hour at a time. The goal is to walk at least 10 minutes every 1 to 2 hours. The patient is also instructed to perform active and passive leg exercises as frequently as necessary when they cannot ambulate, such as during long car, bus, train, and plane trips. In addition, deep breathing exercises are beneficial because they produce increased negative pressure in the thorax, which assists in emptying the large veins.</p>

Your primary provider should be contacted before taking any over-the-counter drugs.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid alcohol if taking warfarin because it may change the body&#x2019;s response to the warfarin. There are no interactions with the oral factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) and alcohol.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid marked changes in eating habits, especially involving foods high in vitamin K, such as green leafy vegetables, which can reduce anticoagulation effectiveness if taking warfarin; dietary habits have no interactions with the oral factor Xa inhibitors.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to instructing the patient on how to apply graduated compression stockings as indicated (see later discussion) and explaining the importance of elevating the legs and exercising adequately, the nurse provides education about the prescribed anticoagulant, its purpose, and the need to take the correct amount at the specific times, especially if warfarin is prescribed (see <a href="#ct26-10">Chart 26-10</a>). The patient should also be aware that if warfarin is prescribed, periodic blood tests are necessary to determine if a change in medication or dosage is required. If the patient fails to adhere to the therapeutic regimen, continuation of the medication therapy should be questioned. In patients with liver disease, the potential for bleeding may be exacerbated by anticoagulant therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6" id="s3316">Pulmonary Embolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Pulmonary embolism (PE)</strong> refers to the obstruction of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by a thrombus (or thrombi) that originate(s) somewhere in the venous system or in the right side of the heart.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1019">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most commonly, PE is due to a dislodged or fragmented DVT (see previous pathophysiology discussion in DVT). However, there are other types of emboli that may be implicated: air, fat, amniotic fluid, and septic (from bacterial invasion of the thrombus) (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A PE is described as an occlusion of the outflow tract of the main pulmonary artery or of the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries. Multiple small emboli can lodge in the terminal pulmonary arterioles, producing multiple small infarctions of the lungs. A pulmonary infarction causes ischemic necrosis of part of the lung (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Thompson &#x0026; Kabrhel, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When a thrombus completely or partially obstructs a pulmonary artery or its branches, the alveolar dead space is increased. The area, although continuing to be ventilated, receives little or no blood flow. Therefore, gas exchange is impaired or absent in this area. In addition, various substances are released from the clot and surrounding area that cause regional blood vessels and bronchioles to constrict. This results in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance&#x2014;a reaction that compounds the ventilation&#x2013;perfusion (V./Q.) imbalance that ensues.</p>
<p class="indent">The hemodynamic consequences are increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to the regional vasoconstriction and reduced size of the pulmonary vascular bed. In severe instances, this may result in an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and, in turn, an increase in right ventricular work to maintain pulmonary blood flow. When the work requirements of the right ventricle exceed its capacity, right ventricular failure occurs, leading to a decrease in cardiac output followed by a decrease in systemic blood pressure and the development of shock (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1020">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of PE depend on the size of the thrombus and the area of the pulmonary artery occluded by the thrombus; they may be nonspecific. Dyspnea is the most frequent symptom; the duration and intensity of the dyspnea depend on the extent of embolization. Chest pain is common and is usually sudden and pleuritic in origin; however, it may be substernal and may mimic angina (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Thompson &#x0026; Kabrhel, 2020</a>). Other symptoms include anxiety, fever, tachycardia, apprehension, cough, diaphoresis, hemoptysis, and syncope. The most frequent sign is tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate) (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1926">De Palo, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In many instances, PE causes few signs and symptoms, whereas in other instances, it mimics various other cardiopulmonary disorders (e.g., pneumonia, heart failure). Obstruction of the pulmonary artery can result in pronounced dyspnea, sudden substernal pain, rapid and weak pulse, shock, syncope, and sudden death (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Thompson &#x0026; Kabrhel, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1021">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because the symptoms of PE can vary from few to severe, a diagnostic workup is performed to rule out other diseases. The initial diagnostic workup may include chest x-ray, ECG, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis, D-dimer assay and MDCTA or pulmonary arteriogram or V./Q. scan. The chest x-ray is usually normal but may show infiltrates, atelectasis, elevation of the diaphragm on the affected side, or a pleural effusion. The chest x-ray is most helpful in excluding other possible causes. In addition to sinus tachycardia, the most frequent ECG abnormality is nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. If an arterial blood gas analysis is performed, it may show hypoxemia and hypocapnia (from tachypnea); however, arterial blood gas measurements may be normal even in the presence of PE (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1926">De Palo, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">MDCTA is the criterion standard for diagnosing PE. The MDCTA can be performed quickly and provides the advantage of high-quality visualization of the lung parenchyma (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Weinberger, Cockrill, &#x0026; Mandel, 2019</a>). If MDCTA is not available, pulmonary angiography is considered a reasonable alternative diagnostic method (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Ouellette, 2019</a>). The pulmonary angiogram allows for direct visualization under fluoroscopy of the arterial obstruction and accurate assessment of the perfusion deficit. A specially trained team must be available to perform the procedure, in which a catheter is threaded through the vena cava to the right side of the heart to inject dye, similar to a cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p class="indent">The V./Q. scan continues to be used to diagnose PE, especially in facilities that do not use pulmonary angiography or do not have access to MDCTA. The V./Q. scan is minimally invasive and requires IV administration of a contrast agent. This scan evaluates different regions of the lung (upper, middle, lower) and allows comparisons of the percentage of V./Q. in each area. This test has a high sensitivity but is not as accurate as an MDCTA or pulmonary angiogram (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1926">De Palo, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1022">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of the patient with PE revolves around whether the patient is diagnosed with a hemodynamically unstable PE (also called a <em>massive PE</em>) or a stable PE. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page851" title="851"></span>The patient with a hemodynamically unstable PE, which comprises a life-threatening emergency, may evidence hypotension, tachycardia, confusion, and cardiovascular collapse.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Medical Management of Unstable Pulmonary Embolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The immediate objective is to stabilize the cardiopulmonary system in the patient with a hemodynamically unstable PE. A sudden increase in pulmonary resistance increases the work of the right ventricle, which can cause acute right-sided heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Emergent measures are initiated to improve respiratory and cardiovascular status (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for discussion of management of the patient in shock).</p>
<p class="indent">After emergency measures have been initiated, the treatment goal is to lyse (dissolve) the existing embolus and prevent new ones from forming. Thrombolytic therapy with t-PA or other agents such as reteplase (see <a href="#tt26-2">Table 26-2</a>) is used in treating unstable PE, particularly in patients who are severely compromised (e.g., those who are hypotensive and have significant hypoxemia despite oxygen supplementation) (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Ouellette, 2019</a>). Thrombolytic therapy lyses the thrombi or emboli quickly and restores hemodynamic functioning of the pulmonary circulation, thereby reducing pulmonary hypertension and improving perfusion, oxygenation, and cardiac output. However, the risk of bleeding is significant. Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include having had a stroke within the past 2 months, other active intracranial processes, active bleeding, surgery within 10 days of the thrombotic event, recent labor and delivery, trauma, or severe hypertension. Consequently, thrombolytic agents are advocated only for PE affecting a significant area of blood flow to the lung and causing hemodynamic instability (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Tapson &#x0026; Weinberg, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Before thrombolytic therapy is started, INR, aPTT, hematocrit, and platelet counts are obtained. Any anticoagulant is stopped prior to administration of a thrombolytic agent. During therapy, all but essential invasive procedures are avoided because of potential bleeding. After the thrombolytic infusion is completed (which varies in duration according to the agent used), maintenance anticoagulation therapy is initiated.</p>
<p class="indent">A surgical embolectomy is rarely performed but may be indicated if there are contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Embolectomy can be performed using catheters or surgically. Surgical removal must be performed by a cardiovascular surgical team with the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Ouellette, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who have recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be inserted (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Tapson, 2019</a>). IVC filters are not recommended for the initial treatment of patients with PE and should not be used in patients receiving anticoagulants. The IVC filter provides a screen in the IVC, allowing blood to flow unobstructed while large emboli from the pelvis or lower extremities are blocked or fragmented before reaching the lung. Numerous devices have been developed since the introduction of the original Greenfield filter (see <a href="#ff26-14">Fig. 26-14</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Medical Management of Stable Pulmonary Embolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In patients with PE who do not demonstrate any cardiopulmonary instability (e.g., normotensive, no evidence of hypoxemia) immediate anticoagulation is indicated to prevent recurrence or extension of the thrombus and may continue for 10 days (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Tapson, 2019</a>). Long-term anticoagulation is also indicated up to 6 months following the PE and is critical in preventing recurrence of VTE. This duration may be extended indefinitely in patients who are at high risk for recurrence (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Weinberger et al., 2019</a>).</p>

The filter (compressed within an applicator catheter) is inserted through an incision in the right internal jugular vein. The applicator is withdrawn when the filter fixes itself to the wall of the inferior vena cava after ejection from the applicator.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">In patients with stable PE, the initial anticoagulant selected may include an LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin), unfractionated heparin, or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., dabigatran), or a factor Xa inhibitor (e.g., fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Tapson &#x0026; Weinberg, 2020</a>) (see <a href="#tt26-2">Table 26-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In select patients with PE who are hemodynamically stable, outpatient therapy can be started by administering the first dose in the emergency department or urgent care center and the remaining doses given at home. Although there are not specific selection criteria for outpatient treatment, the patient is usually at low risk of death, has no respiratory or hemodynamic compromise, does not require opioids for pain control, has no risk factors for bleeding, has no serious comorbid conditions, and has stable baseline mental status with a good understanding of the benefits and risks of treatment (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Tapson, 2019</a>). The ideal agent for outpatient administration is not empirically confirmed, although the DOACs are often prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">Long-term treatment options include warfarin and the DOACs. An LMWH may also be selected but is usually not prescribed for long-term therapy since it is given via a subcutaneous injection. Warfarin dosing requires regular blood draws for INR monitoring and has a higher bleeding risk, but it has long been the standard of care prior to the development of DOACs. An antidote (vitamin K) is available if the INR is high and there is a risk of bleeding. Warfarin does have interactions with several medications (see <a href="#ct26-10">Chart 26-10</a>) and has dietary restrictions. DOACs do not require regular blood test monitoring; however, they are more costly than warfarin. The choice of warfarin versus a DOAC is dependent upon risk of bleeding, cost, presence of comorbidities, and provider preference (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1971">The Joint Commission [TJC], 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1023">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Thrombolytic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse is responsible for monitoring the patient&#x2019;s response to thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy. During the thrombolytic infusion, while the patient remains on bed rest, vital signs are frequently assessed and invasive procedures are avoided. Tests to determine INR or aPTT are performed 3 to 4 hours after the thrombolytic infusion is started to confirm that the fibrinolytic systems have been activated.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Because of the prolonged clotting time, only essential arterial punctures or venipunctures are performed in patients who have received thrombolytics, and manual pressure is applied to any puncture site for at least 30 minutes. Pulse oximetry is used to monitor changes in oxygenation. The thrombolytic infusion is discontinued immediately if uncontrolled bleeding occurs.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chest pain, if present, is usually pleuritic rather than cardiac in origin. A semi-Fowler position provides a more comfortable position for breathing. However, the nurse must continue to turn patients frequently and reposition them to improve V./Q.. The nurse administers opioid analgesic agents as prescribed for severe pain.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Oxygen Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Careful attention is given to the proper use of oxygen. The patient must understand the need for continuous oxygen therapy. The nurse assesses the patient frequently for signs of hypoxemia and monitors the pulse oximetry values to evaluate the effectiveness of the oxygen therapy. Deep breathing and incentive spirometry are indicated for all patients to minimize or prevent atelectasis and improve ventilation (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for discussion of incentive spirometry). Nebulizer therapy or percussion and postural drainage may be used for management of secretions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Anxiety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse encourages the patient who is stabilized to talk about any fears or concerns related to this frightening episode, answers the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s questions concisely and accurately, explains the therapy, and describes how to recognize untoward effects early.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring for Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When caring for a patient who has had PE, the nurse must be alert for the potential complication of cardiogenic shock or right ventricular failure subsequent to the effect of PE on the cardiovascular system. (Nursing activities for managing shock are found in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>; see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for nursing management of right ventricular failure.)</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Providing Postoperative Nursing Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient has undergone surgical embolectomy, the nurse measures the patient&#x2019;s pulmonary arterial pressure and urinary output. The nurse also assesses the insertion site of the arterial catheter for hematoma formation and infection. Maintaining the blood pressure at a level that supports perfusion of vital organs is crucial. To prevent peripheral venous stasis and edema of the lower extremities, the nurse elevates the foot of the bed and encourages isometric exercises, the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices, and walking when the patient is permitted out of bed. Sitting for long periods is discouraged, because hip flexion compresses the large veins in the legs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before hospital discharge and at follow-up visits to the clinic, the nurse educates the patient about preventing recurrence and reporting signs and symptoms. Patient education instructions, presented in <a href="#ct26-11">Chart 26-11</a>, are intended to help prevent recurrences and side effects of treatment.</p>

<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">During follow-up or home visits, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the prescribed management plan and reinforces previous instructions. The nurse also monitors the patient for residual effects of the PE and recovery. The patient is reminded about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments for coagulation tests, if indicated, and appointments with the primary provider.</p>
