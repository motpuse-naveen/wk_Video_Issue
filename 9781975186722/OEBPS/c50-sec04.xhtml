<h4 class="h4" id="s2271">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in the management of female physiologic processes. The nurse should educate the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse should be aware of contraindications, potential complications, and trends in results. Trends provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2272">Cytologic Test for Cancer (Pap Smear)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Pap smear is used to detect cervical cancer. Cervical secretions are gently removed from the cervical os and may be transferred to a glass slide and fixed immediately by spraying with a fixative or immersed in solution. If the Pap smear reveals atypical cells, the liquid method allows for HPV testing. See <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a> for further discussion of HPV.</p>
<p class="indent">Terminology used to describe findings includes the following categories:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>No abnormal or atypical cells</span></li>
<li><span>Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance</span></li>
<li><span>Inflammatory reactions and microbes identified</span></li>
<li><span>Positive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test for HPV</span></li>
<li><span>Precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix identified</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The patient may incorrectly assume that an abnormal Pap smear signifies cancer. If the Pap smear (liquid immersion method) shows atypical cells and no high-risk HPV types, the next Pap smear is performed in 1 year. If a specific infection is causing inflammation, it is treated appropriately, and the Pap smear is repeated. If the repeat Pap smear reveals atypical squamous cells with high-risk HPV types, colposcopy may be indicated. Pap smears that indicate precancerous lesions should be repeated in 4 to 6 months and colposcopy performed if the lesion has not resolved. Patients with Pap smears that indicate cancerous lesions require prompt colposcopy (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the Pap smear results are abnormal, prompt notification, evaluation, and treatment are crucial. Notification of patients is often the responsibility of nurses in a women&#x2019;s health care practice or clinic. Pap smear follow-up is essential because it can provide early detection of cervical cancer. Interventions are tailored to meet the needs and health beliefs of the particular patient. Intensive telephone counseling, tracking systems, brochures, videos, and financial incentives have all been used to encourage follow-up. The nurse provides clear <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1653" title="1653"></span>explanations and emotional support along with a carefully designed setting-specific follow-up protocol designed to meet the needs of the patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2273">Colposcopy and Cervical Biopsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the cervical cytology screening result requires evaluation, a colposcopy is performed. The colposcope is an instrument with a magnifying lens that allows the examiner to visualize the cervix and obtain a sample of abnormal tissue for analysis (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Nurse practitioners and gynecologists require special training in this diagnostic technique.</p>
<p class="indent">After inserting a speculum and visualizing the cervix and vaginal walls, the examiner applies acetic acid to the cervix. Subsequent abnormal findings that indicate the need for biopsy include leukoplakia (white plaque visible before applying acetic acid), acetowhite tissue (white epithelium after applying acetic acid), punctation (dilated capillaries occurring in a dotted or stippled pattern), mosaicism (a tilelike pattern), and atypical vascular patterns. If biopsy specimens show precancerous cells, the patient usually requires cryotherapy, laser therapy, or a cone biopsy (excision of an inverted tissue cone from the cervix).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2274">Cryotherapy and Laser Therapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cryotherapy (freezing cervical tissue with nitrous oxide) and laser treatment are used in the outpatient setting. Cryotherapy may result in cramping and occasional feelings of faintness (vasovagal response). A watery discharge is normal for a few weeks after the procedure as the cervix heals; however, excessive bleeding, pain, or fever should be reported to the primary provider (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2275">Cone Biopsy and Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If endocervical curettage findings indicate abnormal changes or if the lesion extends into the canal, the patient may undergo a cone biopsy. This can be performed surgically or with a procedure called <em>loop electrosurgical excision procedure</em> (LEEP), which uses a laser beam (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Usually performed in the outpatient setting, LEEP is associated with a high success rate in removal of abnormal cervical tissue. The gynecologist excises a small amount of cervical tissue, and the pathologist examines the borders of the specimen to determine if disease is present. A patient who has received anesthesia for a surgical cone biopsy is advised to rest for 24 hours after the procedure and to leave any vaginal packing in place until it is removed (usually the next day). The patient is instructed to report any excessive bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse or primary provider provides guidelines regarding postoperative sexual activity, bathing, and other activities. Because open tissue may be potentially exposed to HIV and other pathogens, the patient is cautioned to avoid penile-vaginal intercourse until healing is complete and verified at follow-up.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2276">Endometrial (Aspiration) Biopsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Endometrial biopsy, a method of obtaining endometrial tissue, is performed as an outpatient procedure. This procedure is usually indicated in cases of midlife irregular bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, and irregular bleeding while taking hormone therapy or tamoxifen. A tissue sample obtained through biopsy permits diagnosis of cellular changes in the endometrium. The only absolute contraindication to an endometrial biopsy is the presence of a viable and desired pregnancy (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3635">Del Priore, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Women who undergo endometrial biopsy may experience slight discomfort. The examiner may apply a tenaculum (a clamplike instrument that stabilizes the uterus) after the pelvic examination and then inserts a thin, hollow, flexible suction tube (Pipelle or sampler) through the cervix into the uterus.</p>
<p class="indent">Findings on aspiration may include normal endometrial tissue, hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. Simple hyperplasia is an overgrowth of the uterine lining and is usually treated with progesterone. Complex hyperplasia, which refers to overgrowth of cells with abnormal features, is a risk factor for uterine cancer and is treated with progesterone and careful follow-up. Women who are overweight, who are older than 45 years, who have a history of nulliparity and infertility, or who have a family history of colon cancer seem to be at higher risk for hyperplasia. See <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a> for discussion of endometrial cancer.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2277">Dilation and Curettage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dilation and curettage (D&#x0026;C) may be diagnostic (identifies the cause of irregular bleeding) or therapeutic (often temporarily stops irregular bleeding). The cervical canal is widened with a dilator, and the uterine endometrium is scraped with a curette. The purpose of the procedure is to secure endometrial or endocervical tissue for cytologic examination, to control abnormal uterine bleeding, and as a therapeutic measure for incomplete abortion.</p>
<p class="indent">Because D&#x0026;C is usually carried out under anesthesia and requires surgical asepsis, it is usually performed in the operating room (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). However, it may take place in the outpatient setting with the patient receiving a local anesthetic supplemented with diazepam or midazolam.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse explains the procedure, preparation, and expectations regarding postoperative discomfort and bleeding. The patient is instructed to void before the procedure. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position, the cervix is dilated with a dilating instrument, and endometrial scrapings are obtained by a curette. A perineal pad is placed over the perineum after the procedure, and excessive bleeding is reported. No restrictions are placed on dietary intake. If pelvic discomfort or low back pain occurs, mild analgesic medications usually provide relief. The primary provider indicates when sexual activity may be safely resumed. To reduce the risk of infection and bleeding, most gynecologists advise no vaginal penetration or use of tampons for 2 weeks.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2278">Endoscopic Examinations</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Laparoscopy (Pelvic Peritoneoscopy)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A laparoscopy, minimally invasive surgery, involves inserting a laparoscope (a tube about 10 mm wide and similar to a small periscope) into the peritoneal cavity through a 2-cm (0.75-inch) incision below the umbilicus to allow visualization of the pelvic structures (see <a href="#ff50-4">Fig.&#x00A0;50-4</a>). Laparoscopy may be used for diagnostic purposes (e.g., in cases of pelvic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1654" title="1654"></span>pain when no cause can be found) or treatment. Laparoscopy facilitates many surgical procedures, such as tubal ligation, ovarian biopsy, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and lysis of adhesions (scar tissue that can cause pelvic discomfort) (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Sharp, 2019</a>). A surgical instrument (intrauterine sound or cannula) may be positioned inside the uterus to permit manipulation or movement during laparoscopy, affording better visualization. The pelvic organs can be visualized after the injection of carbon dioxide intraperitoneally into the cavity. Called <em>insufflation,</em> this technique separates the intestines from the pelvic organs (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Sharp, 2019</a>). If a patient is undergoing sterilization, the fallopian or uterine tubes may be electrocoagulated, sutured, or ligated and a segment removed for histologic verification (clips are an alternative device for occluding the tubes).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff50-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff50-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff50-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;50-4 &#x2022;</span> Laparoscopy. The laparoscope (<em>right</em>) is inserted through a small incision in the abdomen. A forceps is inserted through the scope to grasp the fallopian tube. To improve the view, a uterine cannula (<em>left</em>) is inserted into the vagina to push the uterus upward. Insufflation of gas creates an air pocket (pneumoperitoneum), and the pelvis is elevated (note the angle), which forces the intestines higher in the abdomen.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">After the laparoscopy is completed, the laparoscope is withdrawn, carbon dioxide is allowed to escape through the outer cannula, the small skin incision is closed with sutures or a clip, and the incision is covered with an adhesive bandage. The patient is carefully monitored for several hours to detect any untoward signs indicating bleeding (most commonly from vascular injury to the hypogastric vessels), bowel or bladder injury, or burns from the coagulator. These complications are rare, making laparoscopy a cost-effective and safe short-stay procedure. The patient may experience abdominal or shoulder pain related to the use of carbon dioxide gas (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hysteroscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hysteroscopy:&lt;/b&gt; an endoscopic procedure performed using a long telescope like instrument inserted through the cervix to diagnose uterine problems">Hysteroscopy</button></strong> (transcervical intrauterine endoscopy) allows direct visualization of all parts of the uterine cavity by means of a lighted optical instrument. The procedure is best performed about 5 days after menstruation ceases, in the estrogenic phase of the menstrual cycle. The vagina and vulva are cleansed, and a paracervical anesthetic block is performed or lidocaine spray is used. The instrument used for the procedure, a hysteroscope, is passed into the cervical canal and advanced 1 or 2 cm under direct vision. Uterine-distending fluid (normal saline solution or dextrose 5% in water) is infused through the instrument to dilate the uterine cavity and enhance visibility. Hysteroscopy, which has few complications, is useful for evaluating endometrial pathology or for evaluating and treating retained products of conception (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Bradley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hysteroscopy may be indicated as an adjunct to a D&#x0026;C and laparoscopy in cases of infertility, unexplained bleeding, retained intrauterine device (IUD), and recurrent early pregnancy loss (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Bradley, 2018</a>). Treatment for some conditions (e.g., fibroid tumors) can be accomplished during this procedure, and sterilization may also be performed. Hysteroscopy is contraindicated in patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma or acute pelvic inflammation.</p>
<p class="indent">An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endometrial ablation:&lt;/b&gt; procedure performed through a hysteroscope in which the lining of the uterus is burned away or ablated to treat abnormal uterine bleeding">endometrial ablation</button></strong> (destruction of the uterine lining) procedure is performed with a hysteroscope and resector (cutting loop), roller ball (a barrel-shaped electrode), or laser beam in cases of severe bleeding not responsive to other therapies. Completed in an outpatient setting under general, regional, or local anesthesia, this rapid procedure is an alternative to hysterectomy for some patients. Following uterine distention with fluid infusion, the lining of the uterus is destroyed. Hemorrhage, perforation, and burns can occur.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1654</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1655" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1655">p. 1655</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2279">Other Diagnostic Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Additional diagnostic procedures may be helpful in evaluating pelvic conditions; these include x-rays, barium enemas, gastrointestinal x-ray series, intravenous (IV) urography, and cystography studies. In addition, because the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are near the structures of the urinary tract, urologic diagnostic studies, such as x-ray study of the kidney, ureters, and bladder (KUB) and pyelography are used, as are angiography and radioisotope scanning, if needed. Other diagnostic procedures include hysterosalpingography (HSG) and computed tomography (CT) scanning.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hysterosalpingography or Uterotubography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">HSG is an x-ray study of the uterus and the fallopian tubes after injection of a contrast agent. The diagnostic procedure is performed to evaluate infertility or tubal patency and to detect any abnormal condition in the uterine cavity. Sometimes, the procedure is therapeutic because the flowing contrast agent flushes debris or loosens adhesions.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to HSG, laxatives and an enema may be given to evacuate the intestinal tract so that gas shadows do not distort the x-ray findings. A mild sedative or an analgesic agent, such as ibuprofen, may be prescribed. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position and the cervix is exposed with a bivalve speculum. A cannula is inserted into the cervix, and the contrast agent is injected into the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes. X-rays are taken to show the path and the distribution of the contrast agent.</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients experience nausea, vomiting, cramps, and faintness. After the test, the patient is advised to wear a perineal pad for several hours, because the radiopaque contrast agent may stain clothing.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Computed Tomography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">CT scans have several advantages over ultrasonography, but they involve radiation exposure and are more costly. They are more effective than ultrasonography for patients with obesity or for patients with a distended bowel. CT scans can also demonstrate a tumor and any extension into the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and skeletal tissue, although they have limited value in diagnosing other gynecologic abnormalities (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ultrasonography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ultrasonography (or ultrasound) is a useful adjunct to the physical examination, particularly in patients receiving obstetric care or in patients with abnormal pelvic examination findings. It is a simple procedure based on sound wave transmission that uses pulsed ultrasonic waves at frequencies exceeding 20,000 Hz (formerly cycles per second) by way of a transducer placed in contact with the abdomen (abdominal scan) or a vaginal probe (vaginal ultrasound). Mechanical energy is converted into electrical impulses, which in turn are amplified and recorded on an oscilloscope screen while a photograph or video recording of the patterns is taken. The entire procedure takes 15 to 30 minutes and involves no ionizing radiation and no discomfort other than a full bladder, which is necessary for good visualization during an abdominal scan. A vaginal ultrasound or sonogram does not require a full bladder; however, the vaginal probe may cause mild discomfort in some women (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces patterns that are finer and more definitive than other imaging procedures, and it does not expose patients to radiation. However, MRI is more costly.</p>
