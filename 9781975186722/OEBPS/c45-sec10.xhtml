<p class="nonindent">Congenital hypothyroidism, which occurs when there is inadequate secretion of thyroid hormone during fetal and neonatal development, results in intellectual disability and stunted physical growth because of general depression of metabolic activity (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). In adults, hypothyroidism manifests as lethargy, slow mentation, weight gain, constipation, cold intolerance, and generalized slowing of body functions (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hyperthyroidism (oversecretion of thyroid hormones) is manifested by a greatly increased metabolic rate. Many of the other characteristics of hyperthyroidism result from the increased response to circulating catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine).</p>
<p class="indent">Oversecretion of thyroid hormones is usually associated with an enlarged thyroid gland known as a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;goiter:&lt;/b&gt; enlargement of the thyroid gland">goiter</button></strong>. Goiter also commonly occurs with iodine deficiency. In this latter condition, lack of iodine results in low levels of circulating thyroid hormones, which causes increased release of TSH; the elevated TSH causes overproduction of thyroglobulin (a precursor of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>) and hypertrophy of the thyroid gland.</p>
