<h4 class="h4a" id="s2855">HEARING LOSS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In the United States, hearing loss has been reported to occur in approximately 2 to 3 of every 1000 births (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2016). More than half of the 4000 infants born deaf each year have a hereditary disorder associated with genetic sensorineural hearing loss (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Antonio, 2018</a>). Genetic syndromes associated with hearing impairment include Waardenburg syndrome, Usher syndrome, Pendred syndrome, and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Antonio, 2018</a>). <a href="#ct59-2">Chart 59-2</a> contains <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1944" title="1944"></span>more information about hearing disorders that have a genetic cause. Hearing loss may also be acquired; causes include TORCH infections (TOxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes) during pregnancy as well as trauma or chronic exposure to loud noise (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Antonio, 2018</a>). Most hospitals or birthing centers offer universal hearing screenings for newborns after birth and prior to discharge.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearing loss occurs in men more often than in women. Approximately 2% of adults between the ages of 45 and 54&#x00A0;years have disabling hearing loss. This percentage increases to 8.5% in the 55 to 64 age group, to 25% of adults in the 65 to 74 age group, and up to 50% for those over 75&#x00A0;years of age (HHS, 2016). Hearing loss is an important health issue; and as people age, hearing screening and treatment are recommended.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people are exposed on a daily basis to noise levels that produce high-frequency hearing loss. Occupations such as carpentry, plumbing, and coal mining have the highest risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Wise Ears was developed by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). It aims to educate the public about noise-induced hearing loss and ways to prevent this hearing loss (NIDCD, 2010).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;conductive hearing loss:&lt;/b&gt; loss of hearing in which efficient sound transmission to the inner ear is interrupted by some obstruction or disease process">Conductive hearing loss</button></strong> usually results from an external ear disorder, such as impacted cerumen, or a middle ear disorder, such as otitis media or otosclerosis. In such instances, the efficient transmission of sound by air to the inner ear is interrupted. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sensorineural hearing loss:&lt;/b&gt; loss of hearing related to damage to the end organ for hearing or cranial nerve VIII, or both">sensorineural hearing loss</button></strong> involves damage to the cochlea or vestibulocochlear nerve.</p>
<p class="indent">Mixed hearing loss and functional hearing loss also may occur. Patients with mixed hearing loss have conductive loss and sensorineural loss, resulting from dysfunction of air and bone conduction. A functional (or psychogenic) hearing loss is nonorganic and unrelated to detectable structural changes in the hearing mechanisms; it is usually a manifestation of an emotional reaction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2856">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;deafness:&lt;/b&gt; partial or complete loss of the ability to hear">Deafness</button></strong> is the partial or complete loss of the ability to hear. Early manifestations may include tinnitus, increasing inability to hear when in a group, and a need to turn up the volume of the television. Hearing loss can also trigger changes in attitude, the ability to communicate, the awareness of surroundings, and even the ability to protect oneself, thus affecting a person&#x2019;s quality of life. In a classroom, a student with hearing loss may be uninterested and inattentive and have failing grades. A pedestrian with hearing loss may attempt to cross the street and fail to hear an approaching car. People with hearing loss may miss parts of conversations, and may gradually interact with others less, leading to feelings of isolation. Many people are unaware of their gradual hearing loss. Often, it is not the person with the hearing loss but the people with whom they are communicating that recognizes the change (see <a href="#ct59-3">Chart 59-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For various reasons, some people with hearing loss refuse to seek medical attention or wear a hearing aid. They may feel self-conscious about wearing a hearing aid. Other people, however, may feel comfortable asking those with whom they are trying to communicate to let them know whether difficulties in communication exist. The attitudes and behaviors of patients who need hearing assistance should be taken into account when counseling them. The decision to wear a hearing aid is a personal one that is affected by these attitudes and behaviors.</p>

</div>
<div class="box3">
<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Assessing for Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse should be alert to the following:</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middletop"><strong>Speech deterioration:</strong> The person who slurs words, drops word endings, or produces flat-sounding speech may not be hearing correctly. Hearing guides the voice, both in loudness and in pronunciation.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Fatigue:</strong> If a person tires easily when listening to conversation or to a speech, fatigue may be the result of straining to hear. Under these circumstances, a person may become easily irritable.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Indifference:</strong> It is easy for the person who cannot hear what others say to become depressed and disinterested in life in general.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Social withdrawal:</strong> Not being able to hear what is going on causes a person who is hard of hearing to withdraw from situations that might prove embarrassing.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Insecurity:</strong> Lack of self-confidence and fear of mistakes create a feeling of insecurity in many people who are hard of hearing. No one likes to say the wrong thing or do anything that might appear foolish.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Indecision and procrastination:</strong> Loss of self-confidence makes it increasingly difficult for a person who is hard of hearing to make decisions.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Suspiciousness:</strong> The person who is hard of hearing&#x2014;who often hears only part of what is being said&#x2014;may suspect that others are talking about them, or that portions of the conversation are deliberately spoken softly so that they will not hear them.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>False pride:</strong> The person who is hard of hearing wants to conceal the hearing loss and thus often pretends to be hearing when they actually is not.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Loneliness and unhappiness:</strong> Although everyone wishes for quiet now and then, enforced silence can be boring and even somewhat frightening. People with a hearing loss often feel isolated.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle"><strong>Tendency to dominate the conversation:</strong> Many people who are hard of hearing tend to dominate the conversation, knowing that as long as it is centered on them and they can control it, they are unlikely to be embarrassed by some mistake.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2857">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many environmental factors have an adverse effect on the auditory system and with time result in permanent sensorineural hearing loss. The most common is noise. Noise (unwanted and unavoidable sound) has been identified as one of today&#x2019;s environmental hazards. The volume of noise that surrounds us daily has increased into a potentially dangerous source of physical and psychological damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Loud, persistent noise has been found to cause constriction of peripheral blood vessels, increased blood pressure and heart rate (because of increased secretion of adrenalin), and increased gastrointestinal activity. Although research is needed to address the overall effects of noise on the human <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1945" title="1945"></span>body, a quiet environment is more conducive to peace of mind. A person who is ill feels more at ease when noise is kept to a minimum.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Numerous factors contribute to hearing loss (see <a href="#ct59-4">Chart 59-4</a>). <em>Noise-induced hearing loss</em> refers to hearing loss that follows a long period of exposure to loud noise (e.g., heavy machinery, engines, artillery, rock-band music). <em>Acoustic trauma</em> refers to hearing loss caused by a single exposure to an extremely intense noise, such as an explosion. Usually, noise-induced hearing loss occurs at a high frequency (about 4000 Hz). However, with continued noise exposure, the hearing loss can become more severe and include adjacent frequencies. The minimum noise level known to cause noise-induced hearing loss, regardless of duration, is about 85 to 90 dB.</p>
<p class="indent">Noise exposure is inherent in many jobs (e.g., mechanics, printers, pilots, flight attendants, musicians) and in hobbies such as woodworking and hunting. Occupational noise level regulations are based on the amount of noise a person is exposed to over an 8-hour work shift, with the maximum legal limits being 85 dB per the NIOSH or 90 dB per the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), with a peak sound pressure of 135 dB (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4231">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018</a>). NIOSH recommends and OSHA requires that workers wear ear protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss when exposed to noise above the legal limits. Ear protection against noise is the most effective preventive measure available. Hearing loss due to noise is permanent because the hair cells in the organ of Corti are destroyed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2858"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">With aging, changes occur in the ear that may eventually lead to hearing deficits. Although few changes occur in the external ear, cerumen tends to become harder and drier, posing a greater chance of impaction. In the middle ear, the tympanic membrane may atrophy or become sclerotic. In the inner ear, cells at the base of the cochlea degenerate. A familial predisposition to sensorineural hearing loss is also seen, manifested by inability to hear high-frequency sounds, followed in time by the loss of middle and lower frequencies. The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;presbycusis:&lt;/b&gt; decreased ability to hear high-pitched tones that naturally begins in midlife as a result of irreversible inner ear changes">presbycusis</button></strong> is used to describe this progressive hearing loss (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to age-related changes, other factors can affect hearing in the older adult population, such as lifelong exposure to loud noises. Psychogenic factors, other disease processes (e.g., diabetes), and medications may be partially responsible for sensorineural hearing loss. Certain medications, such as aminoglycosides, aspirin, loop diuretics, and platinum-based antineoplastic medications have ototoxic effects when kidney changes result in delayed medication excretion and increased levels of the medications in the blood.</p>
<p class="indent">Even with the best health care, people with hearing loss must learn to adjust. Care of older patients includes recognizing emotional reactions related to hearing loss, such as suspicion of others because of an inability to hear adequately; frustration and anger, with repeated statements such as &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t hear what you said!&#x201D;; and feelings of insecurity because of the inability to hear the telephone or alarms. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 requires that all emergency services are accessible to people who have text message telephones (teletypewriters [TTYs]). In addition, all 911 centers in the United States must be accessible to people with TTYs.</p>
<p class="indent">Depression, isolation, and a decrease in cognitive function can have a negative impact on quality of life in the older adult with hearing loss. Feelings of social isolation, confusion, alterations in daily living activities, and increasing risk of falls have all been associated with hearing loss in older adults (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4248">Shukla, Reed, Armstrong, et al., 2019</a>). Hearing loss has also been identified as a factor associated with a significant increase in the risk of hospitalization, readmission, and increased mortality (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4233">Hsu, McKee, Roscigno, et al., 2019</a>). Additionally, hearing loss can interfere with relationships due to a loss of communication. A hearing screening is recommended as one component of the physical examination for the older adult when joining Medicare for the first time. &#x201C;Welcome to Medicare&#x201D; examinations and annual screenings are also important.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2859">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If a hearing loss is permanent or untreatable or if the patient elects not to be treated, aural rehabilitation (discussed at the end of the chapter) may be beneficial.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2860">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Early detection of hearing loss is in the plans for <em>Healthy People 2030,</em> and nurses are in a position to assist in meeting this goal if included (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Haskins, 2017</a>; HHS, 2017). Another possible objective is for people diagnosed with hearing loss or deafness to use rehabilitation services and supplemental devices to improve communication with hearing people. Resources are available in workplaces and in schools. Questions used to assess for hearing loss may include:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Have you experienced any hearing loss in the past?</li>
<li>Are you experiencing any hearing loss now?</li>
<li>Do your family members think that you are having difficulty hearing or experiencing any hearing loss?</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">These questions should be included in any routine nursing assessment and referrals made for further evaluation as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses who understand the different types of hearing loss are more successful in adopting a communication style to fit the needs and preferences of each patient. Trying to speak in a loud voice to a person who cannot hear high-frequency sounds only makes understanding more difficult. However, strategies such as talking into the better-hearing ear and using gestures and facial expressions can help (see <a href="#ct59-5">Chart 59-5</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Communicating with People Who Are Deaf or Have Severe Hearing Loss</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>For the Person Who Is Hard of Hearing Whose Speech Is Difficult to Understand</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Determine how the person prefers to communicate with others. Do not assume that writing, gestures, or other means are the best or preferred technique.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Consider if the person uses sign language. Interpreters are available from American Sign Language Services, Inc. (ASLI). These specialists provide the best means of communication, providing accurate, professional services.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Devote full attention to what the person is saying. Look and listen&#x2014;do not try to attend to another task while listening.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Engage the speaker in conversation when it is possible for you to anticipate the replies. This enables you to become accustomed to any peculiarities in speech patterns.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Try to determine the essential context of what is being said; you can often fill in the details from context.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not try to appear as if you understand if you do not.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you cannot understand at all or have serious doubt about your ability to understand what is being said, have the person write the message rather than risk misunderstanding. Having the person repeat the message in speech, after you know its content, also aids you in becoming accustomed to the person&#x2019;s pattern of speech.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Written communication is an excellent resource. Material should be written at a third-grade level so that the majority of people can understand it.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>For the Person Who Is Hard of Hearing Who Speech Reads</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that speech or lip reading is ineffective because the majority of English sounds are not clearly visible on the lips and even the most proficient lip readers understand less than 30% of verbal communication.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When speaking, always face the person as directly as possible.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Make sure that your face is as clearly visible as possible. Locate yourself so that your face is well lighted; avoid being silhouetted against strong light. Do not obscure the person&#x2019;s view of your mouth in any way; avoid talking with any object held in your mouth.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be sure that the patient knows the topic or subject before going ahead with what you plan to say. This enables the person to use contextual clues in speech reading.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Speak slowly and distinctly, pausing more frequently than you would normally.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you question whether some important direction or instruction has been understood, check to be certain that the patient has the full meaning of your message.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If, for any reason, your mouth must be covered (as with a mask), you must direct or instruct the patient, write or communicate the message by another means.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A major issue for many people who are deaf or hard of hearing is that they have other health problems that often do not receive attention, in large part because of communication barriers with their health care providers. To meet the health care needs of these patients, providers are legally obligated to make accommodations for the most effective patient communication and understanding. Providing certified interpreters for those who can communicate through sign language is essential in many situations to ensure effective communication.</p>
<p class="indent">During health care and screening procedures, the provider (e.g., dentist, physician, nurse) must be aware that patients who are deaf or hard of hearing are unable to read lips, see a signer, or read written materials in the dark rooms required during some diagnostic tests. The same situation exists if the provider is wearing a mask or is not in sight (e.g., x-ray studies, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], colonoscopy).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses and other health care providers must work with patients who are deaf or hard of hearing and their families to identify practical and effective means of communication. Nurses can serve as catalysts throughout the health care system to ensure that accommodations are made to meet the communication needs of every patient.</p>
