<h4 class="h4" id="s2005">Cushing&#x2019;s Syndrome</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The most common cause of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome (also known as Cushing&#x2019;s disease) is the use of corticosteroid medications, but the syndrome can also be due to excessive glucocorticoid production secondary to hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex (Sadiq &#x0026; Silverstein, 2019a). However, overproduction of endogenous glucocorticoids may be caused by several mechanisms, including a tumor of the pituitary gland that produces ACTH and stimulates the adrenal cortex to increase its hormone secretion despite production of adequate amounts. Primary hyperplasia of the adrenal glands in the absence of a pituitary tumor is less common. Another less common cause of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome is the ectopic production of ACTH by malignancies; bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common type. Regardless of the cause, the normal feedback mechanisms that control the function of the adrenal cortex become ineffective, and the usual diurnal pattern of cortisol is lost. The signs and symptoms of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome are primarily a result of oversecretion of glucocorticoids and androgens, although mineralocorticoid secretion may be affected as well (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2006">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When overproduction of the adrenocortical hormone occurs, arrest of growth, obesity, and musculoskeletal changes occur along with glucose intolerance. The classic picture of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome in the adult is that of central-type obesity, with a fatty &#x201C;buffalo hump&#x201D; in the neck and supraclavicular areas, a heavy trunk, and relatively thin extremities. The skin is thin, fragile, and easily traumatized; ecchymoses (bruises) and striae develop. The patient complains of weakness and lassitude. Sleep is disturbed because of altered diurnal secretion of cortisol.</p>
<p class="indent">Excessive protein catabolism occurs, producing muscle wasting and osteoporosis. Kyphosis, backache, and compression fractures of the vertebrae may result. Retention of sodium and water occurs as a result of increased mineralocorticoid activity, producing hypertension and heart failure.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient develops a &#x201C;moon-faced&#x201D; appearance and may experience increased oiliness of the skin and acne. Hyperglycemia or overt diabetes may develop. The patient may also report weight gain, slow healing of minor cuts, and bruises.</p>
<p class="indent">Women between the ages of 20 and 40 years are five times more likely than men to develop Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome. In females of all ages, virilization may occur as a result of excess androgens. Virilization is characterized by the appearance of masculine traits and the recession of feminine traits. Hirsutism (excessive growth of hair on the face) occurs, the breasts atrophy, menses cease, the clitoris enlarges, and the voice deepens. Libido is lost in men and women. Distress and depression are common and are increased by the severity of the physical changes that occur with this syndrome. If Cushing&#x2019;s disease is a consequence of pituitary tumor, visual disturbances may occur because of pressure of the growing tumor on the optic chiasm. <a href="#ct45-12">Chart 45-12</a> summarizes the clinical manifestations of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2007">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The three tests used to diagnose Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome are serum cortisol, urinary cortisol, and low-dose dexamethasone <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1480" title="1480"></span>suppression tests. Two of these three tests need to be unequivocally abnormal to diagnose Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome. If the results of all three tests are normal, the patient likely does not have Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome (but may have a mild case, or the manifestations may be cyclic). For these patients, further testing is not recommended unless symptoms progress. If test results are either slightly abnormal or discordant, further testing is recommended.</p>
<p class="indent">Serum cortisol levels are usually higher in the early morning (6 to 8 am) and lower in the evening (4 to 6 pm). This variation is lost in patients with Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A urinary cortisol test requires a 24-hour urine collection. The nurse instructs the patient how to collect and store the specimen. If the results of the urinary cortisol test are three times the upper limit of the normal range and one other test is abnormal, Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome can be assumed.</p>
<p class="indent">An overnight dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnosis pituitary and adrenal causes of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome. It can be performed on an outpatient basis. Dexamethasone (1 or 8 mg) is given orally late in the evening or at bedtime, and a plasma cortisol level is obtained at 8 am the next morning. Suppression of cortisol to less than 5 mg/dL indicates that the hypothalamic&#x2013;pituitary&#x2013;adrenal axis is functioning properly (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Stress, obesity, depression, and medications such as anticonvulsant agents, estrogen (during pregnancy or as oral medications), and rifampin can falsely elevate cortisol levels.</p>
<p class="indent">Indicators of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome include an increase in serum sodium and blood glucose levels and a decrease in serum potassium, a reduction in the number of blood eosinophils, and disappearance of lymphoid tissue. Measurements of plasma and urinary cortisol levels are obtained. Several blood samples may be collected to determine whether the normal diurnal variation in plasma levels is present; this variation is frequently absent in adrenal dysfunction. If several blood samples are required, they must be collected at the times specified, and the time of collection must be noted on the requisition slip.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2008">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome is caused by pituitary tumors rather than tumors of the adrenal cortex, treatment is directed at the pituitary gland. Surgical removal of the tumor by transsphenoidal hypophysectomy (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>) is the treatment of choice. Radiation of the pituitary gland has also been successful, although it may take several months for control of symptoms. Adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice in patients with unilateral primary adrenal hypertrophy. Medical management is recommended for bilateral adrenal dysplasia.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperatively, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may begin to appear 12 to 48 hours after surgery because of reduction of the high levels of circulating adrenal hormones. Temporary replacement therapy with hydrocortisone may be necessary for several months, until the adrenal glands begin to respond normally to the body&#x2019;s needs.</p>
<p class="indent">Adrenal enzyme inhibitors (e.g., metyrapone, aminoglutethimide, mitotane, and ketoconazole) may be used to reduce hyperadrenalism if the syndrome is caused by ectopic ACTH secretion by a tumor that cannot be eradicated. Close monitoring is necessary, because symptoms of inadequate adrenal function may result, and side effects of the medications may occur.</p>
<p class="indent">If Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome is a result of the administration of corticosteroids, an attempt is made to reduce or taper the medication to the minimum dosage needed to treat the underlying disease process (e.g., autoimmune or allergic disease, rejection of a transplanted organ). Frequently, alternate-day therapy decreases the symptoms of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome and allows recovery of the adrenal glands&#x2019; responsiveness to ACTH.</p>
<p class="indent">Diabetes and peptic ulcer are common in patients with Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome. Therefore, insulin therapy and medication to prevent or treat peptic ulcer are initiated if needed. Before, during, and after surgery, blood glucose monitoring and assessment of stools for blood are carried out to monitor for these complications. If the patient has other symptoms of Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome, these are considered in the preoperative preparation. For example, if the patient has experienced weight gain, special instruction is given about postoperative breathing exercises.</p>

<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse36"><strong>The Patient with Cushing&#x2019;s Syndrome</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The health history and examination focus on the effects on the body of high concentrations of adrenal cortex hormones and on the inability of the adrenal cortex to respond to changes in cortisol and aldosterone levels. The history includes information about the patient&#x2019;s level of activity and ability to carry out routine and self-care activities. The skin is observed and assessed for trauma, infection, breakdown, bruising, and edema. Changes in physical appearance are noted, and the patient&#x2019;s responses to these changes are elicited. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s mental function, including mood, responses to questions, awareness of environment, and level of depression. The family is often a good source of information about gradual changes in the patient&#x2019;s physical appearance as well as emotional status.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph30"><strong><small>NURSING DIAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major priority nursing diagnoses include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for impaired cardiac function associated with changes in cardiac function</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for injury associated with weakness</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for infection associated with altered immune system function</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired skin integrity associated with edema, impaired healing, and thin and fragile skin</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disturbed body image associated with altered physical appearance, impaired sexual functioning, and decreased activity level</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Difficulty coping associated with mood swings, irritability, and depression</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1481" title="1481"></span><strong><small>COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Addisonian crisis</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Adverse effects of adrenocortical activity</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include maintenance of adequate cardiac function, decreased risk of injury, decreased risk of infection, improved skin integrity, improved body image, improved mental function, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph30"><strong><small>MAINTAINING ADEQUATE CARDIAC FUNCTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient who is taking corticosteroid medications should be monitored for the presence of hypertension and hypokalemia. The nurse assesses fluid and electrolyte status by monitoring laboratory values and daily weights. The patient should be educated about foods low in sodium to decrease fluid retention and foods high in potassium; referral to a dietitian may be useful. The patient should also be instructed to report and pedal edema or changes in activity tolerance.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>DECREASING RISK OF INJURY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Establishing a protective environment helps prevent falls, fractures, and other injuries to bones and soft tissues. The patient who is very weak may require assistance from the nurse in ambulating to avoid falling or bumping into sharp corners of furniture. Foods high in protein, calcium, and vitamin D are recommended to minimize muscle wasting and osteoporosis. Referral to a dietitian may assist the patient in selecting appropriate foods that are also low in sodium and calories.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>DECREASING RISK OF INFECTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient should avoid unnecessary exposure to others with infections. The nurse frequently assesses the patient for subtle signs of infection, because the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may mask the common signs of inflammation and infection.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>PROMOTING SKIN INTEGRITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Meticulous skin care is necessary to avoid traumatizing the patient&#x2019;s fragile skin. The use of adhesive tape is avoided, because it can irritate the skin and tear the fragile tissue when the tape is removed. The nurse frequently assesses the skin and bony prominences and encourages and assists the patient to change positions frequently to prevent skin breakdown.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>IMPROVING BODY IMAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient may benefit from discussion of the effect the changes have had on their self-concept and relationships with others. Weight gain and edema may be modified by a low-carbohydrate, low-sodium diet, and a high-protein intake may reduce some of the other bothersome symptoms. The patient may also benefit from discussion of the changes being temporary if the treatment with corticosteroids is temporary.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>IMPROVING COPING</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Explanations to the patient and family members about the cause of emotional instability are important in helping them cope with the mood swings, irritability, and depression that may occur. Psychotic behavior may occur in a few patients and should be reported. The nurse encourages the patient and family members to verbalize their feelings and concerns.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Addisonian Crisis.</span> The patient with Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome whose symptoms are treated by withdrawal of corticosteroids, by adrenalectomy, or by removal of a pituitary tumor is at risk for adrenal hypofunction and Addisonian crisis. If high levels of circulating adrenal hormones have suppressed the function of the adrenal cortex, atrophy of the adrenal cortex is likely. If the circulating hormone level is decreased rapidly because of surgery or abrupt cessation of corticosteroid agents, manifestations of adrenal hypofunction and Addisonian crisis may develop. Therefore, the patient with Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome should be assessed for signs and symptoms of Addisonian crisis as discussed previously. If Addisonian crisis occurs, the patient is treated for circulatory collapse and shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Adverse Effects of Adrenocortical Activity.</span> The nurse assesses fluid and electrolyte status by monitoring laboratory values and daily weights. Because of the increased risk of glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia, blood glucose monitoring is initiated. The nurse reports elevated blood glucose levels to the primary provider so that treatment can be prescribed if needed. If indicated, the patient may need to be educated in self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin injections.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>PROMOTING HOME, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND TRANSITIONAL CARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="orange">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient, family, and caregivers should be educated that acute adrenal insufficiency and underlying symptoms will recur if medication is stopped abruptly without medical supervision. The nurse stresses the need for dietary modifications to ensure adequate calcium intake without increasing the risks for hypertension, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. The nurse educates the patient and family about how to monitor blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and weight. Patients should be advised to wear a medical alert bracelet and to notify other health care providers (e.g., dentist) about their condition (see <a href="#ct45-13">Chart 45-13</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The need for follow-up depends on the origin and duration of the disease and its management. The patient who has been treated by adrenalectomy or removal of a pituitary tumor requires close monitoring to ensure that adrenal function has returned to normal and adequacy of circulating adrenal hormones. Home care referral may be indicated to ensure a safe environment that minimizes stress and risk of falls and other side effects. The home health nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status and reports changes to the primary provider. The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of and ability to manage the medication regimen and reinforces previous education about the medications and the importance of taking them as prescribed. The nurse emphasizes the importance of regular medical follow-up, the side effects and toxic effects of medications, and the need to wear medical identification with Addison&#x2019;s and Cushing&#x2019;s diseases. In addition, the patient and family are reminded about the importance of health promotion activities and recommended health screening, including bone mineral density testing.</p>
