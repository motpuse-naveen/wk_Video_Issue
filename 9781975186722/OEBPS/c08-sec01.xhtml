<h4 class="h4" id="s145">Overview of Aging</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s146">Demographics of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The proportion of Americans 65 years of age and older has increased from 37 million in 2006 to 49.2 million in 2016 (a 33% increase). It is projected that by 2060, the older adult population will double to 98 million. Currently one in every seven persons is an older adult, or 15.2% of the population. As the older adult population increases, the number of people who live to a very old age is also dramatically increasing. The greatest growth in the older adult population is for those aged 85 years and older; this population is projected to more than double from 6.4 million in 2016 to 14.6 million in 2040, a 129% increase (AoA, 2020). Life expectancy&#x2014;the average number of years that a person can expect to live&#x2014;varies by gender and race, with women living longer than men and White women having the longest life expectancy. The difference in life expectancy between the genders is a full 5 years. Life expectancy has risen dramatically in the past 100 years. In 1900, average life expectancy was 47 years and by 2009, that figure had increased to 78.8 years. In 2016, life expectancy decreased by 0.2% to 78.6% (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib586">Xu, Murphy, Kochanek, et el., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The older adult population is becoming more diverse, reflecting changing demographics in the United States. Although this population will increase in number for all minority groups, the rate of growth is projected to be fastest in the Hispanic population, which is expected to increase by 112% between 2016 and 2030. Proportionally, there will be a significant decline in the percentage of the White non-Hispanic population, which is anticipated to increase only by 39% by 2030 (AoA, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s147">Health Status of the Older Adult</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although many older adults enjoy good health, most have at least one chronic illness, and many have multiple health conditions. Chronic conditions, many of which are preventable or treatable, are the major cause of disability and pain among older adults (see <a href="#ff8-1">Fig.&#x00A0;8-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most deaths in the United States occur in people 65 years of age and older. However, improvements in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of diseases have impacted the health of people in this age group. In the past 60 years, there has been a significant decline in overall deaths&#x2014;specifically, deaths from heart disease and cancer, the two leading causes of deaths. In addition, deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, influenza, pneumonia, and sepsis, have declined (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Xu et al., 2018</a>). Deaths from unintentional injuries and chronic lower pulmonary diseases exchanged places, making unintentional injuries the third leading cause of death. Deaths from Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) have risen and are projected to quadruple by the year 2050, affecting 14 million U.S. adults aged 65 years and older (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib558">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Between the years 2012 and 2014, 78% of noninstitutionalized Americans aged 65 years and older rated their health as good, very good, or excellent (AoA, 2020). Men and women reported comparable levels of health; however, positive health reports declined with advancing age. Even at the age of 85 years and more, the majority of Americans reported good or better health. Blacks, Hispanics, and Latinos appeared less likely to report good health than their White counterparts. Most Americans 75 years of age and older remained functionally independent regardless of how they perceived their health. The proportion of older Americans reporting a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page168" title="168"></span>limitation in activities declined from 49% in 1992 to 44% in 2013 (AoA, 2020). These declines in limitations may reflect trends in health promotion and disease prevention activities, such as improved nutrition, decreased smoking, increased exercise, and early detection and treatment of risk factors such as hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels.</p>

<p class="indent">Many chronic conditions commonly found among older people can be managed, limited, and even prevented. Older people are more likely to maintain good health and functional independence if encouraged to do so and if appropriate community-based support services are available (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). Nurses need to promote positive lifelong health behaviors, because the impact of unhealthy behaviors and choices can result in chronic disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s148">Nursing Care of the Older Adult</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gerontology:&lt;/b&gt; the combined biologic, psychologic, and sociologic study of older adults within their environment">Gerontology</button></strong>, the study of the aging process, is a multidisciplinary field that draws from the biologic, psychologic, and sociologic sciences. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;geriatrics:&lt;/b&gt; a field of practice that focuses on the physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and management of the disorders and diseases of older adults">Geriatrics</button></strong> is the practice (medical or nursing) that focuses on the physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and management of the disorders and diseases of older adults. Care for older adults should not be limited to one discipline but is best provided through a cooperative effort. An interdisciplinary approach to providing care combines expertise and resources to provide comprehensive geriatric assessment and intervention. Nurses collaborate with the team to obtain appropriate services for patients and provide a holistic approach to care.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gerontologic/geriatric nursing:&lt;/b&gt; the field of nursing that relates to the assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation of older adults in all environments, including acute, intermediate, and skilled care, as well as within the community">Gerontologic/geriatric nursing</button></strong> is the field of nursing that specializes in the care of older adults. The Scope and Standards of Gerontological Nursing Practice was originally developed in 1969 by the American Nurses Association (ANA) and revised in 2010 (ANA, 2010). The nurse gerontologist can be either a specialist or a generalist providing comprehensive nursing care to older adults by combining the basic nursing process with a specialized knowledge of aging. Gerontologic nursing is provided in acute care, skilled and assisted living, the community, and home settings. The goals of care include promoting and maintaining functional status as well as helping older adults identify and use their strengths to achieve optimal independence.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses who are certified in geriatric nursing have specialized knowledge of the acute and chronic challenges specific to older adults. The use of advanced practice nurses who have been educated in geriatric nursing concepts has proved to be very effective when dealing with the complex care needs of an older patient. When best practices are used and current scientific knowledge applied to clinical problems, there is significantly less deterioration in the overall health of aging patients (ANA, 2010).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to specialists, nurses who work in all areas of adult medical-surgical nursing encounter older adult patients. Nurses must be knowledgeable and skilled in meeting the complex needs of these patients. Nurses and caregivers who work with older patients must understand that aging is not synonymous with disease and that the effects of the aging process alone are not the only or even the primary contributors to disability and disease. Aging is a highly individualized and multifaceted process (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib578">Sommerlad, Sabia, Singh-Manoux, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Functional assessment is a common framework for assessing older adults. Age-related changes, as well as additional risk factors such as disease and the effects of medications, can reduce function. Assessing the functional consequences of aging and proposing practical interventions helps to maintain and improve the health of older adults (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>). The goal is to help older adults sustain maximum functional level and dignity despite physical, social, and psychological losses. Early intervention can prevent complications of many health problems and help maximize the quality of life.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s149">Theories of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aging has been defined chronologically by the passing of time&#x2014;subjectively, as in how a person feels, and functionally, as in changes in physical or mental capabilities. Many theories attempt to provide a framework in which to understand aging from different perspectives. Clinicians can use each theory to gain insight into different aspects of aging.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the biologic, developmental, and sociologic theories of aging, Miller (2019) developed the Functional Consequences Theory, which encourages nurses to consider the effects of normal age-related changes as well as the damage incurred through disease or environmental and behavioral risk factors when planning care. This theory suggests that nurses can alter the outcome for patients through nursing interventions that address the consequences of these changes. Age-related changes and risk factors may negatively interfere with patient outcomes and impair patient activity and quality of life. For example, normal age-related changes in vision may increase sensitivity to glare. Alterations in the environment that reduce glare may enhance patient comfort and safety. In contrast, the development of cataracts, which is not a normal age-related change, also may increase sensitivity to glare. The nurse must differentiate between normal, irreversible age-related changes and modifiable risk factors. Doing so helps the nurse design appropriate nursing interventions that have a positive impact on outcomes for older patients&#x2014;most importantly, for their quality of life.</p>
