<p class="nonindent">Many health concerns of women are related to normal changes or abnormalities of the menstrual cycle and may result from women&#x2019;s lack of understanding of the menstrual cycle, developmental changes, and factors that may affect the pattern of the menstrual cycle. Educating women about the menstrual cycle and changes over time is an important aspect of the nurse&#x2019;s role in providing quality care to women. Education should begin early so that menstruation and the lifelong changes in the menstrual cycle can be anticipated and accepted as a normal part of life.</p>
