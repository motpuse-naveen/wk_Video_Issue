<h4 class="h4" id="s179">Pain Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The highly subjective nature of pain causes challenges in assessment and management; however, the patient&#x2019;s self-report is the undisputed standard for assessing the existence and intensity of pain (APS, 2016; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib678">Herr, Coyne, McCaffery, et al., 2011</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib626">McCaffery, Herr, &#x0026; Pasero, 2011</a>). Self-report <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page203" title="203"></span>is considered the most reliable measure of the existence and intensity of the patient&#x2019;s pain and is recommended by The Joint Commission (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Baker, 2017</a>). Accepting and acting on the patient&#x2019;s report of pain are sometimes difficult. Because pain cannot be proven, clinicians may feel vulnerable to inaccurate or untruthful reports of pain. Although clinicians are entitled to their personal opinions, those thoughts cannot interfere with appropriate patient care. <a href="#ct9-1">Chart&#x00A0;9-1</a> provides strategies to use when the patient&#x2019;s report of pain is not accepted.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Although accepting and responding to the report of pain may result in administering analgesic agents to an occasional patient who does not have pain, doing so helps to ensure that everyone who does have pain receives appropriate care. Health care professionals do not have the right to deprive any patient of appropriate assessment and treatment simply because they believe a patient is not being truthful. Pain is an extremely personal experience manifested uniquely by each person. It is important to carefully assess and reassess pain when administering analgesic medications.</em></p></div>

<h5 class="h5" id="s180">Performing the Comprehensive Pain Assessment: Patient Interview</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A comprehensive pain assessment should be conducted during the admission assessment or initial interview with the patient, with each new report of pain, and whenever indicated by changes in the patient&#x2019;s condition or treatment plan. It serves as the foundation for developing and evaluating the effectiveness of the pain treatment plan. The following are components of a comprehensive pain assessment and tips on how to elicit the information from the patient:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Location(s) of pain:</em> Ask the patient to state or point to the area(s) of pain on the body. Sometimes allowing patients to make marks on a body diagram is helpful in gaining this information.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Intensity:</em> Ask the patient to rate the severity of the pain using a reliable and valid pain assessment tool. <a href="#ct9-2">Chart&#x00A0;9-2</a> provides guidance for educating patients and their families on how to use a pain rating scale. Various scales translated in several languages have been evaluated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page204" title="204"></span>and made available for use in clinical practice and for educational practice. The most common include the following:</span></li></ul>
<div class="box11a"><p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct9-2"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;9-2 <img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Educating Patients and Their Families How to Use a Pain Rating Scale<em><sup>a</sup></em></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA1"><strong>Step 1.</strong> Show the pain rating scale to the patient and the family and explain its primary purpose.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example:</em> &#x201C;This is a pain rating scale that many of our patients use to help us understand their pain and to set goals for pain relief. We will ask you regularly about pain, but any time you have pain you must let us know. We do not always know when you hurt.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA1"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Explain the parts of the pain rating scale. If the patient does not like it or understand it, switch to another scale (e.g., vertical presentation, VDS, or faces).</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example:</em> &#x201C;On this pain rating scale, 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst possible pain. The middle of the scale, around 5, means moderate pain. A 2 or 3 would be mild pain, but 7 or higher means severe pain.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA1"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Discuss pain as a broad concept that is not restricted to a severe and intolerable sensation.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example:</em> &#x201C;Pain refers to any kind of discomfort anywhere in your body. Pain also means aching and hurting. Pain can include pulling, tightness, burning, knifelike feelings, and other unpleasant sensations.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA1"><strong>Step 4.</strong> Verify that the patient understands the broad concept of pain. Ask the patient to mention two examples of pain they have experienced. If the patient is already in pain that requires treatment, use the present situation as the example.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example:</em> &#x201C;I want to be sure that I have explained this clearly, so would you give me two examples of pain you have had recently?&#x201D; If the patient&#x2019;s examples include various parts of the body and various pain characteristics, that indicates that they understand pain as a fairly broad concept. An example of what a patient might say is &#x201C;I have a mild, sort of throbbing headache now, and yesterday my back was aching.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA1"><strong>Step 5.</strong> Ask the patient to practice using the pain rating scale with the present pain or select one of the examples mentioned.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example:</em> &#x201C;Using the scale, what is your pain right now? What is it at its worst?&#x201D; OR &#x201C;Using the pain rating scale and one of your examples of pain, what is that pain usually? What is it at its worst?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA1"><strong>Step 6.</strong> Set goals for comfort and function/recovery/quality of life. Ask patients what pain rating would be acceptable or satisfactory, considering the activities required for recovery or for maintaining a satisfactory quality of life.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example for a surgical patient:</em> &#x201C;I have explained the importance of coughing and deep breathing to prevent pneumonia and other complications. Now we need to determine the pain rating that will not interfere with this so that you may recover quickly.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARAb"><em>Example for patient with chronic pain or terminal illness:</em> &#x201C;What do you want to do that pain keeps you from doing? What pain rating would allow you to do this?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara"><sup><em>a</em></sup>When a patient is obviously in pain or not focused enough to learn to use a pain rating scale, pain treatment should proceed without pain ratings. Education can be undertaken when pain is reduced to a level that facilitates understanding how to use a pain scale.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara0">VDS, verbal descriptor scale.</p>

<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS):</em> The NRS is most often presented as a horizontal 0- to 10-point scale, with word anchors of &#x201C;no pain&#x201D; at one end of the scale, &#x201C;moderate pain&#x201D; in the middle of the scale, and &#x201C;worst possible pain&#x201D; at the end of the scale. It may also be put on a vertical axis, which may be helpful for patients who read from right to left.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Wong&#x2013;Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale:</em> The FACES scale consists of six cartoon faces with word descriptors, ranging from a smiling face on the left for &#x201C;no pain (or hurt)&#x201D; to a frowning, tearful face on the right for &#x201C;worst pain (or hurt).&#x201D; Patients are asked to choose the face that best reflects their pain. The faces are most commonly numbered using a 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 metric, although 0 to 5 can also be used. Patients are asked to choose the face that best describes their pain. The FACES scale is used in adults and children as young as 3 years (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib626">McCaffery et al., 2011</a>). It is important to appreciate that FACES scales are self-report tools; clinicians should not attempt to match a face shown on a scale to the patient&#x2019;s facial expression to determine pain intensity. Patients may be able to understand the tool better if it is displayed vertically with no pain as the anchor at the bottom.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Faces Pain Scale&#x2014;Revised (FPS-R):</em> The FPS-R has six faces to make it consistent with other scales using the 0 to 10 metric. The faces range from a neutral facial expression to one of intense pain and are numbered 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. As with the Wong&#x2013;Baker FACES scale, patients are asked to choose the face that best reflects their pain. Faces scales have been shown to be reliable and valid measures in children as young as 3 years of age; however, the ability to optimally quantify pain (identify a number) is not acquired until approximately 8 years of age (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib715">Spagrud, Piira, &#x0026; Von Baeyer, 2003</a>). Ongoing research suggests that the FPS-R is preferred by both patients who are cognitively intact and older adults who are cognitively impaired, and by minority populations (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Kang &#x0026; Demiris, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Verbal descriptor scale (VDS):</em> A VDS uses different words or phrases to describe the intensity of pain, such as &#x201C;no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain, and worst possible pain.&#x201D; The patient is asked to select the phrase that best describes pain intensity.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Visual Analogue</em> <em>Scale (VAS):</em> The VAS is a horizontal (sometimes vertical) 10-cm line with word anchors at the extremes, such as &#x201C;no pain&#x201D; on one end and &#x201C;pain as bad as it could be&#x201D; or &#x201C;worst possible pain&#x201D; on the other end. Patients are asked to make a mark on the line to indicate intensity of pain, and the length of the mark from &#x201C;no pain&#x201D; is measured and recorded in centimeters or millimeters. Although often used in research, the VAS is impractical for use in daily clinical practice and rarely used in that setting.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Quality:</em> Ask the patient to describe how the pain feels. Descriptors such as &#x201C;sharp,&#x201D; &#x201C;shooting,&#x201D; or &#x201C;burning&#x201D; may help identify the presence of neuropathic pain.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Onset and duration:</em> Ask the patient when the pain started and whether it is constant or intermittent.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Aggravating and relieving factors:</em> Ask the patient what makes the pain worse and what makes it better.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Effect of pain on function and quality of life:</em> The effect of pain on the ability to perform recovery activities should be regularly evaluated in the patient with acute pain. It is particularly important to ask patients with persistent pain about how pain has affected their lives, what they could do before the pain began that they can no longer do, or what they would like to do but cannot do because of the pain.</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong><em>Comfort</em></strong>&#x2013;<strong><em>function goal</em></strong> (pain intensity): For patients with acute pain, identify short-term functional goals and reinforce to the patient that good pain control will more likely lead to successful achievement of the goals. For example, surgical patients are told that they will be expected to ambulate or participate in physical therapy postoperatively. Patients with chronic pain can be asked to identify their unique functional or quality-of-life goals, such as being able to work or walk the dog. Success is measured by progress toward meeting those functional goals (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Topham &#x0026; Drew, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="BL2First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Other information:</em> The patient&#x2019;s culture, past pain experiences, and pertinent medical history such as comorbidities, laboratory tests, and diagnostic studies are considered when establishing a treatment plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are unable to report their pain are at higher risk for undertreated pain than those who can report (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Horgas, 2017</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib626">McCaffery et al., 2011</a>). In the adult population, this includes patients who are cognitively impaired, critically ill (intubated, unresponsive), comatose, or imminently dying. Patients who are receiving neuromuscular blocking agents or are sedated from anesthesia and other medications given during surgery are also among this at-risk population.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hierarchy of Pain Measures is recommended as a framework for assessing pain in patients who are nonverbal (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib678">Herr et al., 2011</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib626">McCaffery et al., 2011</a>). The key components of the hierarchy require the nurse to (1) attempt to obtain self-report, (2) consider underlying pathology or conditions and procedures that might be painful (e.g., surgery), (3) observe behaviors, (4) evaluate physiologic indicators, and (5) conduct an analgesic trial. <a href="#ct9-3">Chart&#x00A0;9-3</a> provides detailed information on each component of the Hierarchy of Pain Measures.</p>
<p class="indent">When patients cannot self-report their pain, some observational tools may be used to help with clinical decision making. Some of these assign a score by observing behaviors that tend to be associated with pain. These observational scores are not considered equivalent to a patient&#x2019;s self-reported pain intensity score, however.</p>
<p class="indent">It is imperative to remember that behaviors can indicate the presence of pain, but the absence of behavior does not indicate the absence of pain. Patients who are not moving or making any sounds may still be experiencing intense pain. For instance, older adults with moderate and severe dementia frequently have comorbid disorders that may cause pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib699">Mueller, Schumacher, Holzer, et al., 2017</a>). Accurately assessing and treating their pain can be difficult to achieve (see <a href="#ct9-4">Chart&#x00A0;9-4</a> Nursing Research Profile: Evaluation of a Tool to Assess Pain in Older Adults with Dementia). The following tools are examples of validated measures that are appropriate for different populations of patients unable to self-report their pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Fry &#x0026; Elliott, 2018</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib690">Kochman, Howell, Sheridan, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib710">Rijkenberg, Stilma, Bosman, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Schofield &#x0026; Abdulla, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ask patients who are intubated and who are awake and oriented to point to a number on the numerical scale if they are able.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Repeat instructions and show the scale each time pain is assessed.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>Consider the patient&#x2019;s condition or exposure to a procedure that is thought to be painful. If appropriate, assume pain is present and document as such when approved by institution policy and procedure. As an example, pain should be assumed to be present in a patient who is unresponsive, mechanically ventilated, and critically ill due to trauma.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>Observe behavioral signs, for example, facial expressions, crying, restlessness, and changes in activity. A pain behavior in one patient may not be in another. Try to identify pain behaviors that are unique to the patient (&#x201C;pain signature&#x201D;). Many behavioral pain assessment tools are available that will yield a pain behavior score and may help determine whether pain is present. However, it is important to remember that a behavioral score is not the same as a pain intensity score. Behavioral tools are used to help identify the presence of pain, but the pain intensity is unknown if the patient is unable to provide it.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A surrogate who knows the patient well (e.g., parent, spouse, or caregiver) may be able to provide information about underlying painful pathology or behaviors that may indicate pain.</p>

Patients quickly adapt physiologically despite pain and may have normal or below normal vital signs in the presence of severe pain. The overriding principle is that the absence of an elevated blood pressure or heart rate does not mean the absence of pain.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Last"><span class="numah"><strong>5.</strong></span>Conduct an analgesic trial to confirm the presence of pain and to establish a basis for developing a treatment plan if pain is thought to be present. An analgesic trial involves the administration of a low dose of nonopioid or opioid and observing patient response. The initial low dose may not be enough to elicit a change in behavior and should be increased if the previous dose was tolerated, or another analgesic agent may be added. If behaviors continue despite optimal analgesic doses, other possible causes should be investigated. In patients who are completely unresponsive, no change in behavior will be evident and the optimized dose of the analgesic agent should be continued.</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The aim of this study was to examine the interrater reliability of the German version of the observation instrument for assessing pain in older adults with dementia called the BISAD for the German (Beobachtungsinstrument f&#x00FC;r das Schmerzassessment bei alten Menschen mit Demenz). This is a tool that is commonly used to assess pain among older adults with moderate and severe dementia who reside in long-term care facilities in both Germany and Austria; however, interrater reliability was not previously done to ensure its validity.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study used a quantitative multicenter-descriptive cross-sectional design with a convenience sample of 71 participants who resided in one of three nursing homes in Austria. The nursing participants consisted of 46 registered nurses who had been working at one of the same three nursing homes for at least 2 y. Nurse participants were paired to independently evaluate a resident participant within the same hour using the eight-item BISAD observational pain assessment tool.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Although modest agreement between raters was noted, the absolute concordance of the total was only 25.32%. The analysis of interrater reliability was low and did not support reliability of the items in the BISAD. There was agreement that pain was greater with movement than when the participant residents were at rest.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings of this study are important since they indicate the items used in the BISAD tool are not reliable for assessing pain in older adult residents with moderate and severe dementia in nursing homes in Austria, although it is commonly used. This is an important finding since use of this tool with that population could yield inaccurate data upon which nurses could base pain management care. One interesting aspect of this study was that behaviors did demonstrate greater pain with activity than when at rest. Finally, the authors note that there may be cultural and language issues that affected the results and encourage a translated version of the tool be assessed in long-term care facilities where English is the primary language.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s181">Reassessing Pain</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Following initiation of the pain management plan, pain is reassessed and documented on a regular basis to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. At a minimum, pain should be reassessed with each new report of pain and before and after the administration of analgesic agents (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib626">McCaffery et al., 2011</a>). The frequency of reassessment depends on the stability of the patient and the timing of peak effect of the medication administered, which is generally between 15 and 30 minutes following parenteral administration and between 1 and 2 hours following oral administration (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib659">Chou, Gordon, de Leon-Casasola, et al., 2016</a>). For example, in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), reassessment may be necessary as often as every 10 minutes when pain is unstable during intravenous (IV) opioid <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;titration:&lt;/b&gt; upward or downward adjustment of the amount (dose) of an analgesic agent">titration</button></strong> but may be done an hour following administration of oral medication in patients with satisfactory and stable pain control the day following surgery.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Nurses should be aware that research has demonstrated a high prevalence of pain associated disorders, including arthritis, fibromyalgia, headaches and generalized abdominal, back, and joint pain in veteran populations (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Nahin, 2017</a>). In addition, reports of severe pain are more common in military veterans compared to nonveterans, especially in those who served, more recently, in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Nahin, 2017</a>). In particular, younger veterans (18 to 39 years of age) and male veterans report significantly higher levels of pain compared to matched age groups and men in the general public (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Nahin, 2017</a>). As a result, it is important for the nurse to determine during assessment if a patient has served in the U.S. military, to recognize that this group may have unique needs related to their service, and to advocate for multimodal and multidisciplinary approaches to help veterans better cope with pain. For example, Groessi, Liu, Change, and colleagues (2017) found that yoga was a safe and beneficial intervention in helping veterans to reduce pain and disability, while taking fewer opioid medications.</p>
