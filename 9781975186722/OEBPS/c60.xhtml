<h3 class="h3">GLOSSARY</h3>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">agnosia:</span> loss of ability to recognize objects through a particular sensory system; may be visual, auditory, or tactile</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">ataxia:</span> inability to coordinate muscle movements, resulting in difficulty in walking, talking, and performing self-care activities</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">autonomic nervous system:</span> division of the nervous system that regulates the involuntary body functions</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">axon:</span> portion of the neuron that conducts impulses away from the cell body</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">Babinski reflex (sign):</span> a reflex action of the toes; in adults is indicative of abnormalities in the motor control pathways leading from the cerebral cortex</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">clonus:</span> abnormal movement marked by alternating contraction and relaxation of a muscle occurring in rapid succession</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">delirium:</span> an acute, confused state that begins with disorientation and if not recognized and treated early can progress to changes in level of consciousness, irreversible brain damage, and sometimes death</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">dendrite:</span> portion of the neuron that conducts impulses toward the cell body</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">flaccidity:</span> displaying lack of muscle tone; limp, floppy</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">parasympathetic nervous system:</span> division of the autonomic nervous system active primarily during nonstressful conditions, controlling mostly visceral functions</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">position (postural) sense:</span> awareness of position of parts of the body without looking at them <em>(</em><em>synonym:</em> proprioception)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">reflex:</span> an automatic response to stimuli</p>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">Romberg test:</span> test for cerebellar dysfunction that can be done with the patient seated or standing; inability to maintain position for 20 seconds is a positive test</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">spasticity:</span> sustained increase in tension of a muscle when it is passively lengthened or stretched</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">sympathetic nervous system:</span> division of the autonomic nervous system with predominantly excitatory responses (<em>synonym</em>: the &#x201C;fight-or-flight&#x201D; system)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">vertigo:</span> illusion of movement in which the individual or the surroundings are sensed as moving</p>

<p class="nonindent">Nurses in many practice settings encounter patients with altered neurologic function. Disorders of the nervous system can occur at any time during the lifespan and can vary from mild, self-limiting symptoms to devastating, life-threatening disorders. Nurses must be skilled in the general assessment of neurologic function and be able to focus on specific areas as needed. Assessment requires knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and an understanding of the array of tests <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1967" title="1967"></span>and procedures used to diagnose neurologic disorders. Knowledge about the nursing implications and interventions related to assessment and diagnostic testing is also essential.</p>
