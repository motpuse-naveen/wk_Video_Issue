<h4 class="h4" id="s3270">Patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms after a psychologically stressful event that is considered outside the range of normal human experience (e.g., rape, combat, motor vehicle crash, natural catastrophe, terrorist attack). Symptoms of this disorder include intrusive thoughts and dreams, phobic avoidance reaction (avoidance of activities that arouse recollection of the traumatic event), heightened vigilance, exaggerated startle reaction, generalized anxiety, and societal withdrawal. PTSD may be acute, chronic, or delayed. PTSD often presents as multiple readmissions to the ED for minor or recurring complaints without evidence of injury.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3271"> <img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Veterans are known to be at heightened risk of PTSD, particularly if they served in combat situations. It is estimated that between 11% and 20% of veterans who served during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003&#x2013;2011) and Operation Enduring Freedom (2001&#x2013;2014) have had PTSD symptoms in a given year. Furthermore, 12% of veterans who served during the Persian Gulf War (1991) have had PTSD symptoms in a given year, while approximately 30% of veterans who served during the Vietnam War (1962&#x2013;1973) have had PTSD symptoms at some point in their lifetime. In addition, veterans of any era may have been subjected to sexual assault or sexual harassment during their time in service, which may have resulted in military sexual trauma (MST), a specific type of PTSD. Approximately 23% of female veterans have been sexually assaulted while serving, while 55% of female veterans and 38% of male veterans have been subjected to sexual harassment while serving. In response to these statistics, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) has sponsored a National Center for PTSD, which provides resources and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2215" title="2215"></span>hotlines to help veterans effectively deal with the effects of PTSD (see the Resources section) (DVA, 2020).</p>
