<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps4">T</span>he medical unit where you work has just been designated to exclusively admit patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). A 35-year-old male admitted to the unit has a history of asthma and hypertension that are both normally well controlled with medication. His temperature is 39&#x00B0;C (101.4&#x00B0;F), he has a cough and tests positive for COVID-19. The nurse manager asks you to develop an evidence-based plan of care that can be individualized for this patient and used as a template for other patients admitted to your unit with COVID-19.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
