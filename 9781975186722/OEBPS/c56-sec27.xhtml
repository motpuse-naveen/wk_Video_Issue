<p class="nonindent">The skin is an important yet uncommon site of metastatic cancer. All types of cancer may metastasize to the skin. Cancers with a predilection to metastasize to the skin include melanomas and cancers of the breast, nasal sinuses, larynx, and oral cavity. Of these, skin metastases from carcinoma of the breast are most frequently seen, accounting for 30% of all cases. The clinical appearance of metastatic skin lesions is not distinctive, except perhaps in some cases of breast cancer in which diffuse, brawny hardening of the skin of the involved breast is seen. In most instances, metastatic lesions occur as multiple cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules of various sizes that may be skin colored or different shades of red (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4007">American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, 2020</a>).</p>
