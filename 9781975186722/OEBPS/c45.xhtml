<p class="nonindent">The endocrine system plays a vital role in orchestrating transportation of chemicals across cell membranes, growth and development, metabolism, fluid and electrolyte balance, acid&#x2013;base balance, adaptation, and reproduction (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). This interconnected network of glands is closely linked with the nervous and immune systems, regulating the functions of multiple body organs. The hypothalamus is responsible for this interrelationship. The pituitary gland, because of its status as the master gland, plays an important role in the regulation of endocrine hormones; its primary function is to secrete hormones into the bloodstream, which in turn affects endocrine glands such as the thyroid. Disorders of the endocrine system are common and are manifested as hyper- and hypofunction.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing interventions are essential in the management of patients with endocrine disorders. This chapter focuses on the anatomy and physiology of the endocrine system; the most common endocrine disorders of the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands; clinical manifestations; diagnostic studies; medical management; and nursing interventions. The unique endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas, pancreatic function, and associated pancreatic disorders are discussed in <a href="c44.xhtml">Chapter 44</a> and reproductive structures, including the ovaries and testes, are discussed in Chapters 50 and 53, respectively.</p>
