<h4 class="h4" id="s1572">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The GI tract is a pathway 7 to 7.9 m (23 to 26 feet) in length that extends from the mouth to the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and rectum, to the terminal structure, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anus:&lt;/b&gt; last section of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; outlet for waste products from the GI system">anus</button></strong> (<a href="#ff38-1">Fig. 38-1</a>). The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;esophagus:&lt;/b&gt; collapsible tube connecting the mouth to the stomach, through which food passes as it is ingested">esophagus</button></strong> is located in the mediastinum, anterior to the spine and posterior to the trachea and heart. This hollow muscular tube, which is approximately 25 cm (10 inches) in length, passes through the diaphragm at an opening called the <em>diaphragmatic hiatus.</em></p>

<p class="indent">The remaining portion of the GI tract is located within the peritoneal cavity. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stomach:&lt;/b&gt; distensible pouch into which the food bolus passes to be digested by gastric enzymes">stomach</button></strong> is situated in the left upper portion of the abdomen under the left lobe of the liver and the diaphragm, overlaying most of the pancreas (see <a href="#ff38-1">Fig. 38-1</a>). A hollow muscular organ with a capacity of approximately 1500 mL, the stomach stores food during eating, secretes digestive fluids, and propels the partially digested food, or chyme, into the small intestine. The gastroesophageal junction is the inlet to the stomach. The stomach has four anatomic regions: the cardia (entrance), fundus, body, and pylorus (outlet). Circular smooth muscle in the wall of the pylorus forms the pyloric sphincter and controls the opening between the stomach and the small intestine.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;small intestine:&lt;/b&gt; longest portion of the GI tract, consisting of three parts&#x2014;duodenum, jejunum, and ileum&#x2014;through which food mixed with all secretions and enzymes passes as it continues to be digested and begins to be absorbed into the bloodstream">small intestine</button></strong> is the longest segment of the GI tract, accounting for about two thirds of the total length. It folds back and forth on itself, providing approximately 70 m (230 feet) of surface area for secretion and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;absorption:&lt;/b&gt; phase of the digestive process that occurs when small molecules, vitamins, and minerals pass through the walls of the small and large intestine and into the bloodstream">absorption</button></strong>, the process by which nutrients enter the bloodstream through the intestinal walls. It has three sections: The most proximal section is the duodenum, the middle section is the jejunum, and the distal section is the ileum. The ileum terminates at the ileocecal valve. This valve, or sphincter, controls the flow of digested material from the ileum into the cecal portion of the large intestine and prevents reflux of bacteria into the small intestine. Attached to the cecum is the vermiform appendix, an appendage that has little or no physiologic function. Emptying into the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater is the common bile duct, which allows for the passage of both bile and pancreatic secretions.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;large intestine:&lt;/b&gt; the portion of the GI tract into which waste material from the small intestine passes as absorption continues and elimination begins; consists of several parts&#x2014;ascending segment, transverse segment, descending segment, sigmoid colon, and rectum (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; colon)">large intestine</button></strong> consists of an ascending segment on the right side of the abdomen, a transverse segment that extends from right to left in the upper abdomen, and a descending segment on the left side of the abdomen. The sigmoid colon, the rectum, and the anus complete the terminal portion of the large intestine. A network of striated muscle that forms both the internal and the external anal sphincters regulates the anal outlet.</p>
<p class="indent">The GI tract receives blood from arteries that originate along the entire length of the thoracic and abdominal aorta and veins that return blood from the digestive organs and the spleen. This portal venous system is composed of five large veins: the superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, gastric, splenic, and cystic veins, which eventually form the vena portae that enters the liver. Once in the liver, the blood is distributed throughout and collected into the hepatic veins that then terminate in the inferior vena cava. Of particular importance are the gastric artery and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the stomach by the gastric artery and to the intestine by the mesenteric arteries (<a href="#ff38-2">Fig. 38-2</a>). Venous blood is returned from the small intestine, cecum, and the ascending and transverse portions of the colon by the superior mesenteric vein, which corresponds with the distribution of the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. Blood flow to the GI tract is about 20% of the total cardiac output and increases significantly after eating.</p>
<p class="indent">Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic portions of the autonomic nervous system innervate the GI tract. In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1210" title="1210"></span>general, sympathetic nerves exert an inhibitory effect on the GI tract, decreasing gastric secretion and motility and causing the sphincters and blood vessels to constrict. Parasympathetic nerve stimulation causes peristalsis and increases secretory activities. The sphincters relax under the influence of parasympathetic stimulation, except for the sphincter of the upper esophagus and the external anal sphincter, which are under voluntary control (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">All cells of the body require nutrients. These nutrients are derived from the intake of food that contains proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and cellulose fibers and other vegetable matter, some of which has no nutritional value. Major functions of the GI tract include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Breakdown of food particles into the molecular form for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;digestion:&lt;/b&gt; phase of the digestive process that occurs when digestive enzymes and secretions mix with ingested food and when proteins, fats, and sugars are broken down into their component smaller molecules">digestion</button></strong></span></li>
<li><span>Absorption into the bloodstream of small nutrient molecules produced by digestion</span></li>
<li><span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;elimination:&lt;/b&gt; phase of the digestive process that occurs after digestion and absorption, when waste products are evacuated from the body">Elimination</button></strong> of undigested unabsorbed foodstuffs and other waste products</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">After food is ingested, it is propelled through the GI tract, coming into contact with a wide variety of secretions that aid in its digestion, absorption, or elimination from the GI tract.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chewing and Swallowing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The process of digestion begins with the act of chewing, in which food is broken down into small particles that can be swallowed and mixed with digestive enzymes. Eating&#x2014;or even the sight, smell, or taste of food&#x2014;can cause reflex salivation. Approximately 1.5 L of saliva is secreted daily from the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual glands. Ptyalin, or salivary <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;amylase:&lt;/b&gt; an enzyme that aids in the digestion of starch">amylase</button></strong>, is an enzyme that begins the digestion of starches. Water and mucus, also contained in saliva, help lubricate the food as it is chewed, thereby facilitating swallowing.</p>
<p class="indent">Swallowing begins as a voluntary act that is regulated by the swallowing center in the medulla oblongata of the central nervous system (CNS). As a bolus of food is swallowed, the epiglottis moves to cover the tracheal opening and prevent aspiration of food into the lungs. Swallowing, which propels the bolus of food into the upper esophagus, thus ends as a reflex action. The smooth muscle in the wall of the esophagus contracts in a rhythmic sequence from the upper esophagus toward the stomach to propel the bolus of food along the tract. During this process of esophageal peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and permits the bolus of food to enter the stomach. Subsequently, the lower esophageal sphincter closes tightly to prevent reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastric Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The stomach, which stores and mixes food with secretions, secretes a highly acidic fluid in response to the presence or anticipated <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ingestion:&lt;/b&gt; phase of the digestive process that occurs when food is taken into the GI tract via the mouth and esophagus">ingestion</button></strong> of food. This fluid, which can total 2.4 L/day, can have a pH as low as 1 and derives its acidity from <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hydrochloric acid:&lt;/b&gt; acid secreted by the glands in the stomach; mixes with chyme to break it down into absorbable molecules and to aid in the destruction of bacteria">hydrochloric acid</button></strong> (HCl) secreted by the glands of the stomach. The function of this gastric secretion is twofold: to break down food into more absorbable components and to aid in the destruction of most ingested bacteria. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pepsin:&lt;/b&gt; a gastric enzyme that is important in protein digestion">Pepsin</button></strong>, an important enzyme for protein digestion, is the end product of the conversion of pepsinogen from the chief cells (<a href="#tt38-1">Table 38-1</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;intrinsic factor:&lt;/b&gt; a gastric secretion that combines with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; so that the vitamin can be absorbed">Intrinsic factor</button></strong>, also secreted by the gastric mucosa, combines with dietary vitamin B<sub>12</sub> so that the vitamin can be absorbed in the ileum. In the absence of intrinsic factor, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> cannot be absorbed, and pernicious anemia results (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Peristaltic contractions in the stomach propel the stomach&#x2019;s contents toward the pylorus. Because large food particles cannot pass through the pyloric sphincter, they are churned back into the body of the stomach. In this way, food in the stomach is mechanically broken down into smaller particles. Food remains in the stomach for a variable length of time, from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the volume, osmotic pressure, and chemical composition of the gastric contents. Peristalsis in the stomach and contractions of the pyloric sphincter allow the partially digested food to enter the small intestine at a rate that permits efficient absorption of nutrients. This partially digested food mixed with gastric secretions is called <strong>chyme.</strong> Hormones, neuroregulators, and local regulators found in the gastric secretions control the rate of gastric secretions and influence gastric motility (<a href="#tt38-2">Table 38-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Small Intestine Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The digestive process continues in the duodenum. Duodenal secretions come from the accessory digestive organs&#x2014;the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder&#x2014;and the glands in the wall of the intestine itself. These secretions contain digestive enzymes: amylase, lipase, and bile. Pancreatic secretions have an alkaline pH due to their high concentration of bicarbonate. This alkalinity neutralizes the acid entering the duodenum from the stomach. Digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;trypsin:&lt;/b&gt; enzyme that aids in the digestion of protein">trypsin</button></strong>, which aids in digesting protein; amylase, which aids in digesting starch; and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lipase:&lt;/b&gt; an enzyme that aids in the digestion of fats">lipase</button></strong>, which aids in digesting fats. These secretions drain into the pancreatic duct, which empties into the common bile duct at the ampulla of Vater. Bile, secreted by the liver and stored in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1211" title="1211"></span>gallbladder, aids in emulsifying ingested fats, making them easier to digest and absorb. The sphincter of Oddi, found at the confluence of the common bile duct and duodenum, controls the flow of bile. Hormones, neuroregulators, and local regulators found in these intestinal secretions control the rate of intestinal secretions and also influence GI motility. Intestinal secretions total approximately 1 L/day of pancreatic juice, 0.5 L/day of bile, and 3 L/day of secretions from the glands of the small intestine. <a href="#tt38-1">Tables 38-1</a> and <a href="#tt38-2">38-2</a> give further information about the actions of digestive enzymes and GI regulatory substances.</p>

<p class="indent">Two types of contractions occur regularly in the small intestine: segmentation contractions and intestinal peristalsis. <em>Segmentation contractions</em> produce mixing waves that move the intestinal contents back and forth in a churning motion. <em>Intestinal peristalsis</em> propels the contents of the small intestine toward the colon. Both movements are stimulated by the presence of chyme.</p>
<p class="indent">Food, ingested as fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, is broken down into absorbable particles (constituent nutrients) by the process of digestion. Carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, maltose, galactose) and monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose). Glucose is the major carbohydrate that tissue cells use as fuel. Proteins are a source of energy after they are broken down into amino acids and peptides. Ingested fats become monoglycerides and fatty acid through emulsification, which makes them smaller and easier to absorb. Chyme stays in the small intestine for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1212" title="1212"></span>3 to 6 hours, allowing for continued breakdown and absorption of nutrients.</p>

<p class="indent">Small, fingerlike projections called <em>villi</em> line the entire intestine and function to produce digestive enzymes as well as to absorb nutrients. Absorption is the major function of the small intestine. Vitamins and minerals are absorbed essentially unchanged. Absorption begins in the jejunum and is accomplished by active transport and diffusion across the intestinal wall into the circulation. Nutrients are absorbed at specific locations in the small intestine and duodenum, whereas fats, proteins, carbohydrates, sodium, and chloride are absorbed in the jejunum. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and bile salts are absorbed in the ileum. Magnesium, phosphate, and potassium are absorbed throughout the small intestine.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Colonic Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Within 4 hours after eating, residual waste material passes into the terminal ileum and slowly into the proximal portion of the right colon through the ileocecal valve. With each peristaltic wave of the small intestine, the valve opens briefly and permits some of the contents to pass into the colon.</p>
<p class="indent">Gut microbes (bacteria), a major component of the contents of the large intestine, assist in completing the breakdown of waste material, especially of undigested or unabsorbed proteins and bile salts. Two types of colonic secretions are added to the residual material: an electrolyte solution and mucus. The electrolyte solution is chiefly a bicarbonate solution that acts to neutralize the end products formed by the colonic bacterial action, whereas the mucus protects the colonic mucosa from the intraluminal contents and provides adherence for the fecal mass.</p>
<p class="indent">Slow, weak peristalsis moves the colonic contents along the tract. This slow transport allows for efficient reabsorption of water and electrolytes, which is the major function of the colon. Intermittent strong peristaltic waves propel the contents for considerable distances. This generally occurs after another meal is eaten, when intestine-stimulating hormones are released. The waste materials from a meal eventually reach and distend the rectum, usually in about 12 hours. As much as one fourth of the waste materials from a meal may still be in the rectum 3 days after the meal was ingested.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Waste Products of Digestion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Feces consist of undigested foodstuffs, inorganic materials, water, and bacteria. Fecal matter is about 75% fluid and 25% solid material (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Norris, 2019</a>). The composition is relatively unaffected by alterations in diet because a large portion of the fecal mass is of nondietary origin, derived from the secretions of the GI tract. The brown color of the feces results from the breakdown of bile by the intestinal bacteria. Chemicals formed by intestinal bacteria are responsible in large part for the fecal odor. Gases formed contain methane, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia, among others. The GI tract normally contains approximately 150 mL of these gases, which are either absorbed into the portal circulation and detoxified by the liver or expelled from the rectum as flatus.</p>
<p class="indent">Elimination of stool begins with distention of the rectum, which initiates reflex contractions of the rectal musculature and relaxes the normally closed internal anal sphincter. The internal sphincter is controlled by the autonomic nervous system; the external sphincter is under the conscious control of the cerebral cortex. During defecation, the external anal sphincter voluntarily relaxes to allow colonic contents to be expelled. Normally, the external anal sphincter is maintained in a state of tonic contraction. Thus, defecation is seen to be a spinal reflex (involving the parasympathetic nerve fibers) that can be inhibited voluntarily by keeping the external anal sphincter closed. Contracting the abdominal muscles (straining) facilitates emptying of the colon. The average frequency of defecation in humans is once daily, but this varies among people.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gut Microbiome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to assisting in the breakdown of waste material, the gut <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;microbiota:&lt;/b&gt; the complement of microbes in a given environment">microbiota</button></strong> (the complement of microbes in the GI tract) also has a role in vitamin synthesis and immune function, including protection against invading pathogens, regulatory influences on innate and adaptive immune responses, and inflammation. Colonization of the GI tract begins shortly after birth; the normal gut microbiota is established by 2 years of age. Several factors over time affect the composition of normal gut microbiota including genetics, diet, personal hygiene, infection, and vaccinations. The number and diversity of microbes within the gut change with aging and are influenced by diet, chronic disease, and medications. Additionally, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiota and lead to overgrowth of potentially pathogenic species (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>; <a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The gut <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;microbiome:&lt;/b&gt; the collective genome of all microbes in a microbiota">microbiome</button></strong>, the collective genome of the microbiota, protects the host against invasion by pathogenic organisms; it produces anti-inflammatory metabolites, destroys toxins, prevents colonization of pathogens, and provokes an immune response (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>; <a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Norris, 2019</a>). The intestinal epithelium is the first line of defense against pathogenic microbes and microbial agents, as it contains innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and mast cells, and has a role in T-cell responses (G&#x00FC;nther, 2018; Haller, 2018; Pezoldt, Yang, Zou, et&#x00A0;al., 2018; Strowig, Thiemann, &#x0026; Diefenbach, 2018). In addition, Peyer&#x2019;s patches (gut-associated lymph tissue) also have a role in antigen processing and immune defense (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). Collectively, the gut microbiome serves the roles of protection and defense.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Although an increased prevalence of several common GI disorders occurs in the older adult population, aging per se appears to have minimal direct effect on most GI functions, in large part because of the functional reserve of the GI tract. Normal physiologic changes of the GI system that occur with aging are identified in <a href="c38-sec02.xhtml#tt38-3">Table 38-3</a>. Careful assessment and monitoring of signs and symptoms related to these changes are imperative. Although irritable bowel symptoms decrease with aging, there seems to be an increase in many GI disorders of function and motility. Older adult patients frequently report dysphagia, anorexia, dyspepsia, and disorders of colonic function (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
