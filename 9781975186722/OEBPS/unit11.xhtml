<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps11">Y</span>ou are a nurse working in an intermediate medical unit caring for a 78-year-old man who was admitted from the emergency department (ED) with a change in level of consciousness and falling at home. His diagnostic and laboratory findings show that he has a lower urinary tract infection (UTI). Your initial assessment reveals the patient is still not oriented to person, place, or time. In addition, he is trying to get up to the bathroom due to urinary urgency caused by the UTI. Because of his change in level of consciousness and urgency, you determine that safety is a priority. You implement falls precautions.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
