<h4 class="h4" id="s3068">Trigeminal Neuralgia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Trigeminal neuralgia, formerly known as <em>tic douloureux</em>, is a condition of the fifth cranial nerve that is characterized by paroxysms of sudden pain in the area innervated by any of the three branches of the nerve (Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020; see Fig.&#x00A0;64-5). The pain ends as abruptly as it starts and is described as a unilateral shooting and stabbing or burning sensation. The unilateral nature of the pain is an important feature. Associated involuntary contraction of the facial muscles can cause sudden closing of the eye or twitching of the mouth, hence the former name <em>tic douloureux</em> (painful twitch). Although the cause is not certain, it is thought to be demyelination of axons in the trigeminal ganglion, root, and nerve by pressing vessels or a demyelinating disease such as MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Trigeminal neuralgia occurs most often as people age, most commonly between the fifth and sixth decade of life. It is more common in women and in people with MS compared to the general population (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Patients who develop trigeminal neuralgia before age 50 years should be evaluated for the coexistence of MS, because trigeminal neuralgia occurs more often in patients with MS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Pain-free intervals may be measured in terms of minutes, hours, days, or longer. With advancing years, the painful episodes tend to become more frequent and agonizing. The patient lives in constant fear of attacks.</p>

<p class="indent">Paroxysms can occur with any stimulation of the terminals of the affected nerve branches, such as washing the face, shaving, brushing the teeth, eating, and drinking. A draft of cold air or direct pressure against the nerve trunk may also cause pain. Certain areas are called <em>trigger points</em> because the slightest touch immediately starts a paroxysm or episode. To avoid stimulating these areas, patients with trigeminal neuralgia try not to touch or wash their faces, shave, chew, or do anything else that might cause an attack. These behaviors are a clue to the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3069">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anticonvulsant agents, such as carbamazepine, relieve pain in most patients with trigeminal neuralgia by reducing the transmission of impulses at certain nerve terminals. Carbamazepine is taken with meals. Serum levels must be monitored to avoid toxicity in patients who require high doses to control the pain. Side effects include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and aplastic anemia (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The patient is monitored for bone marrow depression during long-term therapy. Gabapentin and baclofen are also used for pain control. If pain control is still not achieved, phenytoin may be used as adjunctive therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If pharmacologic management fails to relieve pain, a number of surgical options are available. Although these procedures may relieve facial pain for a few years, recurrence is possible (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The choice of procedure depends on the patient&#x2019;s preference and health status. The procedures are designed to either decompress the nerve and save nerve function, or to damage the nerve and destroy nerve function to keep it from malfunctioning (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Microvascular Decompression of the Trigeminal Nerve</p>
<p class="nonindent">An intracranial approach is used to relieve the contact between the cerebral vessel and the trigeminal nerve root entry. With the aid of an operating microscope, the artery loop is lifted from the nerve to relieve the pressure, and a small prosthetic device is inserted to prevent recurrence of impingement on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2109" title="2109"></span>the nerve. The postoperative management is the same as for other intracranial surgeries (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Radiofrequency Thermal Coagulation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Percutaneous radiofrequency produces a thermal lesion on the trigeminal nerve. Although immediate pain relief is experienced, dysesthesia of the face and loss of the corneal reflex may occur. MRI is used for identification of the trigeminal nerve followed by gamma knife radiosurgery. Gamma knife radiosurgery is a noninvasive method of delivering focused radiation to the trigeminal nerve (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Obermann, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Percutaneous Balloon Microcompression</p>
<p class="nonindent">Percutaneous balloon microcompression disrupts large myelinated fibers in all three branches of the trigeminal nerve. After its placement, the balloon is filled with a contrast material for fluoroscopic identification. The balloon compresses the nerve root for 1 minute and provides microvascular decompression (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3070">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative management of a patient with trigeminal neuralgia occurs mostly on an outpatient basis and includes recognizing factors that may aggravate excruciating facial pain, such as food that is too hot or too cold or jarring of the patient&#x2019;s bed or chair. Even washing the face, combing the hair, or brushing the teeth may produce acute pain. The nurse can assist the patient in preventing or reducing this pain by providing education about preventive strategies. Providing cotton pads and room temperature water for washing the face, instructing the patient to rinse with mouthwash after eating if toothbrushing causes pain, and performing personal hygiene during pain-free intervals are all effective strategies. The patient is instructed to take food and fluids at room temperature, to chew on the unaffected side, and to ingest soft foods. The nurse recognizes that anxiety, depression, and insomnia often accompany chronic painful conditions and uses appropriate interventions and referrals. See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for management of patients with chronic pain.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Postoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative neurologic assessments are conducted to evaluate the patient for facial motor and sensory deficits in each of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. If the surgery results in sensory deficits to the affected side of the face, the patient is instructed not to rub the eye because the pain of a resulting injury will not be detected. The eye is assessed for irritation or redness. Artificial tears may be prescribed to prevent dryness in the affected eye. The patient is cautioned not to chew on the affected side until numbness has diminished. The patient is observed carefully for any difficulty in eating or swallowing foods of different consistencies.</p>
