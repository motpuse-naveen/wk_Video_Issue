<h4 class="h4" id="s2745">Common Ocular Medications</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Common ocular medications include topical anesthetic, mydriatic, and cycloplegic agents that reduce IOP; anti-infective medications; corticosteroids; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiallergy medications; eye irrigants; and lubricants.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2746">Topical Anesthetic Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One or two drops of proparacaine hydrochloride and tetracaine hydrochloride are instilled before diagnostic procedures such as tonometry and minor ocular procedures such as removal of sutures or conjunctival or corneal scrapings. Topical anesthetic agents are also used for severe eye pain to allow the patient to open their eyes for examination or treatment (e.g., eye irrigation for chemical burns). Anesthesia occurs within 20 seconds to 1 minute and lasts 10 to 20 minutes.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2747">Mydriatic and Cycloplegic Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mydriasis, or pupil dilation, is the main objective of the administration of mydriatics and cycloplegics (see <a href="#tt58-3">Table 58-3</a>). These two types of medications function differently and are used in combination to achieve the maximal dilation that is needed during surgery and fundus examinations to give the ophthalmologist a better view of the internal eye structures. Mydriatics potentiate alpha-adrenergic sympathetic effects that result in the relaxation of the ciliary muscle. This causes the pupil to dilate. However, this sympathetic action alone is not enough to sustain mydriasis because of its short duration of action. The strong light used during an eye examination also stimulates miosis (i.e., pupillary contraction). Cycloplegic medications are given to paralyze the iris sphincter.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is educated about the temporary effects of mydriasis on vision, such as glare and the inability to focus properly. The patient may have difficulty reading. The effects of the various mydriatics and cycloplegics can last 3 hours to several days. The patient is advised to wear sunglasses (most eye clinics provide protective sunglasses). The ability to drive depends on the person&#x2019;s age, vision, and comfort level. Some patients can drive safely with the use of sunglasses, whereas others may need to be driven home.</p>
<p class="indent">Mydriatic and cycloplegic agents affect the central nervous system. Their effects are most prominent in younger and older adult patients; these patients must be assessed closely for symptoms, such as increased blood pressure, tachycardia, dizziness, ataxia, confusion, disorientation, incoherent speech, and hallucination. These medications are contraindicated in patients with narrow angles or shallow anterior chambers and in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2748">Medications Used to Treat Glaucoma</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Therapeutic medications for glaucoma are used to lower IOP by decreasing aqueous production or increasing aqueous outflow. Because glaucoma calls for lifetime therapy, the patient must be educated with regard to both the ocular and systemic side effects of the medications. See section on glaucoma later in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2749">Anti-Infective Medications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anti-infective medications include antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents. Most are available as drops, ointments, or subconjunctival or intravitreal injections. Antibiotics <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1909" title="1909"></span>include penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. The main antifungal agent is amphotericin B. Side effects of amphotericin are serious and include severe pain, conjunctival necrosis, iritis, and retinal toxicity. Antiviral medications include acyclovir and ganciclovir. They are used to treat ocular infections associated with herpes virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Patients receiving ocular anti-infective agents are subject to the same side effects and adverse reactions as those receiving oral or parenteral medications.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2750">Corticosteroids and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Topical preparations of corticosteroids are commonly used in inflammatory conditions of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, lens, and uvea. In posterior segment diseases that involve the posterior sclera, retina, and optic nerve, topical agents are less effective and parenteral and oral routes are preferred. When a suspension is prescribed, the patient is instructed to shake the bottle several times to promote mixture of the medication and maximize its therapeutic effect. The most common ocular side effects of long-term topical corticosteroid administration are glaucoma, cataracts, susceptibility to infection, impaired wound healing, mydriasis, and ptosis. High IOP may develop, which is reversible after corticosteroid use is discontinued. To avoid the side effects of corticosteroids, NSAIDs are used as an alternative in controlling inflammatory eye conditions and postoperatively to reduce inflammation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2751">Antiallergy Medications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ocular hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic conjunctivitis, are extremely common. These conditions result primarily from responses to environmental allergens. Most allergens are airborne or carried to the eye by the hand or by other means, although allergic reactions may also be drug induced. Corticosteroids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents to control ocular hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2752">Ocular Irrigants and Lubricants</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most irrigating solutions are used to cleanse the external lids to maintain lid hygiene, to irrigate the external corneal surface to regain normal pH (e.g., in chemical burns), to irrigate the corneal surface to eliminate debris, or to inflate the globe intraoperatively. These solutions have various compositions that include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, bicarbonate, glucose, and glutathione (i.e., substance found in the aqueous humor). Sterile irrigating solutions for lid hygiene are available. Irrigating solutions are safe to use with an intact corneal surface; however, the corneal surface should not be irrigated in cases of threatened corneal perforation. For patients with severe corneal ulcer, specific instructions from the ophthalmologist must be obtained regarding whether it is safe to irrigate the corneal surface or just to cleanse the external lids. Although it is good practice to promote hygiene, prevention of complications must be the primary concern. Normal saline solutions are commonly used to irrigate the corneal surface when chemical burns occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Lubricants, such as artificial tears, help alleviate corneal irritation, such as dry eye syndrome. Artificial tears are topical preparations of carboxymethylcellulose or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose that are prepared as eye drop solutions, ointments, or ocular inserts (inserted at the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac once each day). The eye drops can be instilled as often as every hour, depending on the severity of symptoms.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2753">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives in administering ocular medications are to ensure proper administration to maximize the therapeutic effects and to ensure the safety of the patient by monitoring for systemic and local side effects (ASORN, 2013). Absorption of eye drops by the nasolacrimal duct is undesirable because of the potential systemic side effects of ocular medications. To diminish systemic absorption and minimize the side effects, it is important to occlude the puncta (see <a href="c58-sec08.xhtml#ct58-5">Chart 58-5</a>). This is especially important for patients who are most vulnerable to medication overdose, including older adults; women who are pregnant or lactating; and patients with cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or kidney disease. A 5-minute interval between instillation of different types of ocular drops is recommended.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the administration of ocular medications, the nurse warns the patient that blurred vision, stinging, and a burning sensation are symptoms that ordinarily occur after instillation and are temporary. Risk for interactions of the ocular medication with other ocular and systemic medications must be emphasized; therefore, a careful patient interview regarding the medications being taken must be obtained.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>To prevent infection, meticulous hand hygiene before and after medication instillation is crucial. In addition, the tip of the eye drop bottle or the ointment tube must never touch any part of the eye, and the medication must be recapped immediately after each use.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">If a patient who instills their own medications cannot feel the eye drops when they are instilled, the eye medication may be refrigerated, because a cold drop is easier to detect. A 5-minute interval between successive administrations allows adequate drug retention and absorption. The patient or the caregiver at home should be asked to demonstrate actual eye drop or ointment instillation and punctal occlusion.</p>
