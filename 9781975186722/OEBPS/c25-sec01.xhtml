<h4 class="h4" id="s929">HEART FAILURE</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Heart failure (HF)</strong> is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac disorders so that the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body&#x2019;s metabolic demands or needs (American Heart Association [AHA], 2019a). The term <em>heart failure</em> indicates myocardial disease in which impaired contraction of the heart (systolic dysfunction) or filling of the heart (diastolic dysfunction) may cause pulmonary or systemic congestion. Some cases of HF are reversible, depending on the cause. Most often, HF is a chronic, progressive condition that is managed with lifestyle changes and medications to prevent episodes of acute decompensated heart failure. These episodes are characterized by increased symptoms of respiratory distress, decreased cardiac output (CO), and poor perfusion. These episodes are also associated with increased hospitalizations, increased health care costs, and decreased quality of life (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Benjamin et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately six million people in the United States have HF, and 870,000 new cases are diagnosed each year (AHA, 2019a). As more people live longer with chronic heart diseases, HF has become an epidemic that challenges the country&#x2019;s health care resources. HF is the most common reason for hospitalization of people older than 65 years and is the second most common reason for visits to a provider&#x2019;s office. Emergency department (ED) visits and hospital readmissions for this disorder are very common, despite efforts to prevent rehospitalizations. Over 20% of patients discharged after treatment for HF are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, and nearly 50% are readmitted to the hospital within 6 months (O&#x2019;Connor, 2017). The estimated economic burden caused by HF in the United States is more than $30 billion annually in direct and indirect costs and is expected to continue to increase over time (CDC, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">HF is more prevalent among African Americans and Hispanics than among Caucasians. The risk for having HF increases with advancing age. For adults over 60 years of age, HF is more prevalent among men than women (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Benjamin et al., 2019</a>). As typical for other major cardiovascular diseases and disorders, cigarette smoking, obesity, poorly managed diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are all risks for HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Benjamin et al., 2019</a>). The onset of HF is typically a morbid consequence of another disease or disorder, including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, cardiomyopathy, valvular disorders, and renal dysfunction with volume overload (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1856">McCance, Huether, Brashers, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is a primary cause of HF, and CAD is found in the majority of patients with HF. Ischemia causes myocardial dysfunction because it deprives heart cells of oxygen and causes cellular damage. Myocardial infarction (MI) causes focal heart muscle necrosis, the death of myocardial cells, and a loss of contractility; the extent of the infarction correlates with the severity of HF. Revascularization of the coronary artery by a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or by coronary artery bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]) may improve myocardial oxygenation and ventricular function and prevent more extensive myocardial necrosis that can lead to HF (see Chapter 23).</p>
<p class="indent">Systemic or pulmonary hypertension increases afterload (resistance to ejection), increasing the cardiac workload and leading to the hypertrophy of myocardial muscle fibers. This can be considered a compensatory mechanism because it initially increases contractility. However, sustained hypertension eventually leads to changes that impair the heart&#x2019;s ability to fill properly during diastole, and the hypertrophied ventricles may dilate and fail (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1897">Yancy, Jessup, Bozkurt, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium. The various types of cardiomyopathy lead to HF and arrhythmias. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the most common type of cardiomyopathy, causes diffuse myocyte necrosis and fibrosis, and commonly leads to progressive HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Norris, 2019</a>). DCM can be idiopathic (unknown cause), or it can result from an inflammatory process, such as myocarditis, or from a cytotoxic agent, such as alcohol or certain antineoplastic drugs. Usually, HF due to cardiomyopathy is chronic and progressive. However, cardiomyopathy and HF may resolve following removal of the causative agent. Genetic testing may be recommended for idiopathic cardiomyopathy (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1895">van der Meer, Gaggin, &#x0026; Dec, 2019</a>) (see Chapter 24).</p>
<p class="indent">Valvular heart disease is also a cause of HF. The valves ensure that blood flows in one direction. With valvular dysfunction, it becomes increasingly difficult for blood to move forward, increasing pressure within the heart and increasing cardiac workload, leading to HF (see Chapter 24).</p>
<p class="indent">Several systemic conditions, including progressive kidney failure, contribute to the development and severity of HF. Nearly 30% of patients with chronic HF also have chronic kidney disease (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Benjamin et al., 2019</a>). In addition, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation may either cause or result from HF; in both instances, the altered electrical stimulation impairs myocardial contraction and decreases the overall efficiency of myocardial function. Other factors, such as hypoxia, acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities, can worsen myocardial function (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s930">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Regardless of the etiology, the pathophysiology of HF results in similar changes and clinical manifestations. Significant myocardial dysfunction usually occurs before the patient experiences signs and symptoms of HF such as shortness of breath, edema, or fatigue.</p>
<p class="indent">As HF develops, the body activates neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms. These mechanisms represent the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page795" title="795"></span>body&#x2019;s attempt to cope with the HF and are responsible for the signs and symptoms that develop (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Norris, 2019</a>). Understanding these mechanisms is important because the treatment for HF is aimed at correcting them and relieving symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common type of HF is systolic HF, also called Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF; see later discussion in Assessment and Diagnostic Findings). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;systolic heart failure:&lt;/b&gt; inability of the heart to pump sufficiently because of an alteration in the ability of the heart to contract; term used to describe a type of heart failure (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction [HFrEF])">Systolic heart failure</button></strong> results in decreased blood ejected from the ventricle. The decreased blood flow is sensed by baroreceptors in the aortic and carotid bodies, and the sympathetic nervous system is then stimulated to release epinephrine and norepinephrine (Fig. 25-1). The purpose of this initial response is to increase heart rate and contractility and support the failing myocardium, but the continued response has multiple negative effects. Sympathetic stimulation causes vasoconstriction in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. A decrease in renal perfusion due to low CO and vasoconstriction then causes the release of renin by the kidneys. Renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which then circulates to the lungs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lumen of pulmonary blood vessels converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, which then increases the blood pressure and afterload. Angiotensin II also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, resulting in sodium and fluid retention by the renal tubules and an increase in blood volume. These mechanisms lead to the fluid volume overload commonly seen in HF. Angiotensin, aldosterone, and other neurohormones (e.g., endothelin) lead to an increase in preload and afterload, which increases stress on the ventricular wall, causing an increase in cardiac workload. A counterregulatory mechanism is attempted through the release of natriuretic peptides. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; brain type) are released from the overdistended cardiac chambers. These substances promote vasodilation and diuresis. However, their effect is usually not strong enough to overcome the negative effects of the other mechanisms (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">As the heart&#x2019;s workload increases, contractility of the myocardial muscle fibers decreases. Decreased contractility results in an increase in end-diastolic blood volume in the ventricle, stretching the myocardial muscle fibers and increasing the size of the ventricle (ventricular dilation). The heart compensates for the increased workload by increasing the thickness of the heart muscle (ventricular hypertrophy). Hypertrophy results in abnormal changes in the structure and function of myocardial cells, a process known as ventricular remodeling. Under the influence of neurohormones (e.g., angiotensin II), enlarged myocardial cells become dysfunctional and die early (a process called <em>apoptosis</em>), leaving the other, functional myocardial cells struggling to maintain CO.</p>
<p class="indent">As cardiac cells die and the heart muscle becomes fibrotic, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diastolic heart failure:&lt;/b&gt; the inability of the left ventricle of the heart to fill and pump sufficiently; term used to define a type of heart failure (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction [HFpEF])">diastolic heart failure</button></strong>, also called Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) (see later discussion in Assessment and Diagnostic Findings), can develop, leading to further dysfunction. A stiff ventricle resists filling, and less blood in the ventricles causes a further decrease in CO. All of these compensatory mechanisms of HF have been referred to as the &#x201C;vicious cycle of heart failure&#x201D; because low CO leads to multiple mechanisms that make the heart work harder, worsening the HF.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s931">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many clinical manifestations are associated with HF (<a href="#ct25-1">Chart 25-1</a>). However, the cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea; fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance; and fluid retention, which may lead to congestion, evidenced by pulmonary and peripheral edema (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1897">Yancy, Jessup, Bozkurt, et al., 2013</a>). The signs and symptoms of HF are related to the ventricle that is most affected. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;left-sided heart failure:&lt;/b&gt; inability of the left ventricle to fill or eject sufficient blood into the systemic circulation (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; left ventricular failure)">Left-sided heart failure</button></strong>, also referred to as left ventricular failure because of the inability of the left ventricle to fill or eject sufficient blood into the systemic circulation, causes different manifestations than <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;right-sided heart failure:&lt;/b&gt; inability of the right ventricle to fill or eject sufficient blood into the pulmonary circulation (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; right ventricular failure)">right-sided heart failure</button></strong>, also referred to as right ventricular failure because of the inability of the right ventricle to fill or eject sufficient blood into the pulmonary circulation. In chronic HF, particularly congestive heart failure, patients may have signs and symptoms of both left- and right-sided heart failure. The patient with pulmonary edema manifests signs and symptoms of acute decompensation, warranting expeditious treatment.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary congestion occurs when the left ventricle cannot effectively pump blood out of the ventricle into the aorta and the systemic circulation. The increased left ventricular end-diastolic blood volume increases the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which decreases blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle during diastole. The blood volume and pressure build up in the left atrium, decreasing flow through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. Pulmonary venous blood volume and pressure increase in the lungs, forcing fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the pulmonary tissues and alveoli, causing pulmonary interstitial edema and impaired gas exchange. The clinical manifestations of pulmonary congestion include dyspnea, cough, pulmonary crackles, and low oxygen saturation levels. An extra heart sound, the S<sub>3</sub>, or &#x201C;ventricular gallop,&#x201D; may be detected on auscultation. It is caused by abnormal ventricular filling (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci &#x0026; Dunlay, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Dumitru, 2018</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, may be precipitated by minimal to moderate activity (dyspnea on exertion [DOE]), yet dyspnea may also occur at rest. The patient may report <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orthopnea:&lt;/b&gt; shortness of breath when lying flat; relieved by sitting or standing">orthopnea</button></strong>, difficulty breathing when lying flat. Patients with orthopnea may use multiple pillows to prop themselves up in bed, or they may sleep sitting up or in a high, reclined position. Some patients have sudden attacks of dyspnea at night, a condition known as <strong>paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)</strong>. Fluid accumulating in the dependent extremities during the day may be reabsorbed into the circulating blood volume when the patient lies down. Because the impaired left ventricle cannot eject the increased circulating blood volume, the pressure in the pulmonary circulation increases, shifting fluid into the alveoli. The fluid-filled alveoli cannot exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Without sufficient oxygen, the patient experiences dyspnea and has difficulty sleeping (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci &#x0026; Dunlay, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Dumitru, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The cough associated with left ventricular failure is initially dry and nonproductive. Most often, patients complain of a dry hacking cough that may be mislabeled as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Over time, the cough may begin to accumulate secretions. Large quantities of frothy sputum, sometimes pink or tan, may be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page797" title="797"></span>produced, indicating acute decompensated HF and pulmonary edema (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci &#x0026; Dunlay, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Dumitru, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Adventitious breath sounds may be heard in various areas of the lungs. Usually, bibasilar crackles that do not clear with coughing are detected in the early phase of left ventricular failure. As the failure worsens and pulmonary congestion increases, crackles may be auscultated throughout the lung fields. At this point, oxygen saturation may decrease.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to pulmonary manifestations, the decreased amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion. The diminished CO has widespread manifestations because not enough blood reaches all of the tissues and organs (low perfusion) to provide the necessary oxygen. The decrease in stroke volume (SV) can also stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to release catecholamines, which further impedes perfusion to many organs, including the kidneys.</p>
<p class="indent">As reduced CO and catecholamines decrease blood flow to the kidneys, urine output drops. Renal perfusion pressure falls, and the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system is stimulated to increase blood pressure and intravascular volume. While the patient sleeps, the cardiac workload decreases, improving renal perfusion. This may cause <strong>nocturia</strong> (i.e., frequent urination at night) (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci &#x0026; Dunlay, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Dumitru, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As HF progresses, decreased output from the left ventricle may cause other symptoms. Decreased gastrointestinal perfusion causes altered digestion. Decreased brain perfusion causes dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, restlessness, and anxiety due to decreased oxygenation and blood flow. As anxiety increases, so does dyspnea, increasing anxiety and creating a vicious cycle. Stimulation of the sympathetic system also causes the peripheral blood vessels to constrict, so the skin appears pale or ashen and feels cool and clammy.</p>
<p class="indent">A decrease in SV causes the sympathetic nervous system to increase the heart rate (tachycardia), often causing the patient to complain of palpitations. The peripheral pulses become weak. Without adequate CO, the body cannot respond to increased energy demands, and the patient becomes easily fatigued and has decreased activity tolerance. Fatigue also results from the increased energy expended in breathing and the insomnia that results from respiratory distress, coughing, and nocturia (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci &#x0026; Dunlay, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Dumitru, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Right-Sided Heart Failure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the right ventricle fails, congestion in the peripheral tissues and the viscera predominates. This occurs because the right side of the heart cannot eject blood effectively and cannot accommodate all of the blood that normally returns to it from the venous circulation. Increased venous pressure leads to jugular venous distention (JVD) and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure throughout the venous system. Systemic clinical manifestations include dependent edema (edema of the lower extremities), <strong>hepatomegaly</strong> (enlargement of the liver), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ascites:&lt;/b&gt; an accumulation of serous fluid in the peritoneal cavity">ascites</button></strong> (accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity), and weight gain due to retention of fluid. Edema usually affects the feet and ankles and worsens when the patient stands or sits for a long period. The edema may decrease when the patient elevates the legs. Edema can gradually progress up the legs and thighs and eventually into the external genitalia and lower trunk. Ascites is evidenced by increased abdominal girth and may accompany lower body edema or may be the only edema present. Sacral edema is common in patients who are on bed rest, because the sacral area is dependent. Pitting edema, in which indentations in the skin remain after even slight compression with the fingertips (Fig. 25-2), is generally obvious after retention of at least 4.5 kg (10 lb) of fluid (4.5 L).</p>

<p class="indent">Hepatomegaly and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen result from venous engorgement of the liver. The increased pressure may interfere with the liver&#x2019;s ability to function (secondary liver dysfunction). As hepatic dysfunction progresses, increased pressure within the portal vessels may force fluid into the abdominal cavity, causing ascites. Ascites may increase pressure on the stomach and intestines and cause gastrointestinal distress. Hepatomegaly may also increase pressure on the diaphragm, causing respiratory distress.</p>
<p class="indent">Anorexia (loss of appetite), nausea, or abdominal pain may result from the venous engorgement and venous stasis within the abdominal organs. The generalized weakness that accompanies right-sided HF results from reduced CO and impaired circulation (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci &#x0026; Dunlay, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Dumitru, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Congestive Heart Failure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Right-sided heart failure can sometimes occur as a result of left-sided failure. The failure of these dual mechanisms is sometimes referred to as <strong>congestive heart failure</strong>. When the left ventricle fails, increased fluid pressure is transferred back through the lungs, leading to damage of the right side of the heart. When the right side loses pumping power, the blood backs up in the body&#x2019;s venous system. This may cause swelling or congestion in the legs, ankles, and swelling within the abdomen such as the GI tract and liver. Increased venous pressure may also lead to JVD and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure throughout the venous system. Edema may be present in the periphery as well as within the pulmonary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page798" title="798"></span>vascular bed. Without appropriate treatment, this may progress to pulmonary edema.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Pulmonary Edema</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pulmonary edema:&lt;/b&gt; pathologic accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces and alveoli of the lungs causing severe respiratory distress">Pulmonary edema</button></strong> is an acute event, reflecting a breakdown of physiologic compensatory mechanisms; hence, it is sometimes referred to as acute decompensated heart failure. It can occur following acute MI or as an exacerbation of chronic HF. When the left ventricle begins to fail, blood backs up into the pulmonary circulation, causing pulmonary interstitial edema. This may occur quickly in some patients, a condition sometimes called <em>flash pulmonary edema.</em> Pulmonary edema can also develop slowly, especially when it is caused by noncardiac disorders such as kidney injury and other conditions that cause fluid overload. The left ventricle cannot handle the volume overload, and blood volume and pressure build up in the left atrium. The rapid increase in atrial pressure results in an acute increase in pulmonary venous pressure, which produces an increase in hydrostatic pressure that forces fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries and into the interstitial spaces and alveoli (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of decreased cerebral oxygenation, the patient may become increasingly restless and anxious. Along with a sudden onset of breathlessness and a sense of suffocation, the patient may be tachypneic with low oxygen saturation levels. The skin and mucous membranes may be pale to cyanotic, and the hands may be cool and clammy. Tachycardia and JVD may be present. Incessant coughing may occur, producing increasing quantities of foamy sputum. The patient may become progressively confused. The situation demands emergent action before oxygenation and perfusion levels become critical.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s932">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For many years, the severity of HF was classified solely according to the patient&#x2019;s symptoms, using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of HF. This classification system, which is still in widespread use, is described in <a href="#tt25-1">Table 25-1</a>. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have developed another HF classification system (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). This system, described in <a href="#tt25-2">Table 25-2</a>, takes into consideration the natural history and progressive nature of HF. The ACC/AHA periodically issues evidence-based guidelines for patients with HF or at high-risk of having HF, using this classification system as a framework for treatment (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1898">Yancy, Jessup, Bozkurt, et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">HF may go undetected until the patient presents with signs and symptoms of pulmonary and peripheral edema. Some of the physical signs that suggest HF may also occur with other diseases, such as kidney injury and COPD; therefore, diagnostic testing is essential to confirm a diagnosis of HF.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of ventricular function is an essential part of the initial diagnostic workup. An echocardiogram is performed to determine the ejection fraction (EF), identify anatomic features such as structural abnormalities and valve malfunction, and confirm the diagnosis of HF. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ejection fraction:&lt;/b&gt; percentage of the end-diastolic blood volume ejected from the ventricle with each heartbeat">ejection fraction</button></strong> is a measure of ventricular contractility; it is the percentage of the end-diastolic blood volume that is ejected with each heartbeat. An expected EF is 55% to 65% of the ventricular volume; the ventricle does not completely empty between contractions (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">There are two recognized main types of left-sided HF, with a third, emerging category. In <strong>heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)</strong>, or systolic heart failure, the left ventricle loses the ability to contract effectively, manifesting as EFs of less than 40%, reflecting decreased CO and pump failure (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)</strong>, or diastolic heart failure, is diagnosed when the left ventricular function measures greater than or equal to 50%, yet the ventricle loses its ability to relax due to myocardial stiffness. Because of the noncompliance of the ventricular wall, the chamber is unable to fill at normal capacity during the relaxation phase of diastole (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Heart failure with midrange ejection fraction (HFmrEF)</strong> is a third and emerging classification category, with EFs typically between 40% and 49% (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1895">van der Meer et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Diagnosing a patient with HFpEF is more challenging than diagnosing a patient with HFrEF, because the diagnosis of HFpEF is a <em>diagnosis of exclusion.</em> That is, it is made by excluding other potential noncardiac causes suggestive of HF. The incidence of HFpEF is increasing and is becoming more commonplace among older adult women with a history of hypertension; indeed, hypertension is the most common underlying cause of HFpEF. Comorbid conditions such as obesity, CAD, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia are also common in patients with HFpEF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the echocardiogram, a chest x-ray and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) are obtained to assist in the diagnosis. Laboratory studies usually performed during the initial workup include serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone, complete blood count (CBC), BNP, and routine urinalysis. The results of these laboratory studies assist in determining the underlying cause and can also be used to establish a baseline to assess effects of treatment. The BNP level is a key diagnostic indicator of HF; high levels are a sign of high cardiac filling pressure and can aid in both the diagnosis and management of HF; in particular, rising levels may suggest an acute exacerbation of HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). BNP levels are best used for diagnostic purposes when there is a baseline measurement and a measurement obtained at the time of treatment (e.g., hospital discharge) to help in determining a posttreatment prognosis (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s933">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The prognosis for patients with HF has improved with the use of evidence-based protocols for patient management. Specific interventions are based on the stage of HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). The management goals of HF include the following (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Cyrille &#x0026; Patel, 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Improvement of cardiac function with optimal pharmacologic management</span></li>
<li><span>Reduction of symptoms and improvement of functional status</span></li>
<li><span>Stabilization of patient condition and lowering of the risk of hospitalization</span></li>
<li><span>Delay of the progression of HF and extension of life expectancy</span></li>
<li><span>Promotion of a lifestyle conducive to cardiac health</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Treatment options vary according to the severity of the patient&#x2019;s condition, comorbidities, and cause of the HF, and may include oral and intravenous (IV) medications, lifestyle modifications, supplemental oxygen, and surgical interventions, including implantation of cardiac devices, and cardiac transplantation (see Chapter 24).</p>
<p class="indent">Managing the patient with HF begins with providing comprehensive education and counseling to the patient and family. The patient and family must understand the nature of HF and the importance of their participation in the treatment regimen, including side and adverse effects of pharmacologic therapies. Lifestyle recommendations include restriction of dietary sodium; avoidance of smoking, including secondhand smoke; avoidance of excessive fluid and alcohol intake; weight reduction when indicated; and regular exercise. The patient must also know how to recognize signs and symptoms that need to be reported to the primary provider.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several types of medications are routinely prescribed for patients with HF. The cornerstone of therapy for patients with HFrEF (systolic HF), which is the most common type of HF, includes a diuretic, an angiotensin system blocker, and a beta-blocker (<a href="#tt25-3">Table 25-3</a>). Many of these medications, particularly angiotensin system blockers and beta-blockers, improve symptoms and extend survival. Others, such as diuretics, improve symptoms but may not affect survival (Meyer, 2019b). The patient with HFpEF (diastolic HF) may be prescribed a diuretic, most commonly an aldosterone antagonist (see <a href="#tt25-3">Table 25-3</a>), and may also be prescribed an angiotensin system blocker and/or a beta-blocker and find symptomatic relief; however, these drugs are not necessarily associated with improved survival in those patients (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Borlaug &#x0026; Colucci, 2019</a>). Target doses for these medications and alternative medications for treating heart failure are identified in the ACC/AHA guidelines. Nurses, primary providers, and pharmacists work collaboratively toward achieving effective dosing of these medications (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Diuretics</p>
<p class="nonindent">Diuretics are prescribed to remove excess extracellular fluid by increasing diuresis in patients with signs and symptoms of fluid overload. ACC/AHA guidelines advocate using the smallest dose of diuretic necessary to control fluid volume (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). The type and dose of diuretic prescribed depend on clinical signs and symptoms and renal function. Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustments are necessary to balance the effectiveness of these medications with the side effects (<a href="#ct25-2">Chart 25-2</a>). Loop, thiazide, and aldosterone-blocking diuretics may be prescribed; these medications differ in their site of action in the kidney and their effects on renal electrolyte excretion and reabsorption.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Loop diuretics,</em> such as furosemide, inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption mainly in the ascending loop of Henle. Patients with HF and with severe volume overload are generally treated with a loop diuretic first (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). <em>Thiazide diuretics,</em> such as metolazone, inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption in the early distal tubules. Both of these classes of diuretics increase potassium excretion; therefore, patients treated with these medications must have their serum potassium levels closely monitored. Diuretics can also lead to orthostatic hypotension and kidney injury. Both a loop and a thiazide diuretic may be used in patients with severe HF who are unresponsive to a single diuretic. The need for diuretics can be decreased if the patient avoids excessive fluid intake (e.g., more than 2000 mL/day) and adheres to a low sodium diet (e.g., no more than 2 g/day).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Aldosterone antagonists</em>, such as spironolactone, are potassium-sparing diuretics that block the effects of aldosterone in the distal tubule and collecting duct (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>). As noted previously, they are frequently prescribed for patients with HFpEF. Serum creatinine and potassium levels are monitored frequently (e.g., within the first week and then every 4 weeks) when spironolactone is first given. These drugs are not prescribed for patients with an elevated serum creatinine.</p>

<p class="indent">Loop diuretics are administered IV for exacerbations of HF when rapid diuresis is necessary, as when pulmonary edema is present (see later discussion). Diuretics improve the patient&#x2019;s symptoms, provided that renal function is adequate. As HF progresses, cardiorenal syndrome may develop or worsen. Cardiorenal syndrome is a type of prerenal acute kidney injury characterized by a disruption in adequate blood flow to the kidneys. Patients with this syndrome are resistant to diuretics and may require other interventions to deal with congestive signs and symptoms.</p>
<p class="h7">Angiotensin System Blockers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Angiotensin system blockers include classes of medications such as the ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).</p>
<p class="h8">Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</p>
<p class="nonindent">ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, have been found to relieve clinical manifestations of HF and significantly decrease mortality and morbidity in patients with HFrEF. Specifically, they slow the progression of HF, improve exercise tolerance, and decrease the number of hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). ACE inhibitors are also appropriate for hypertension management in patients with HFpEF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). Available as oral and IV medications, ACE inhibitors promote vasodilation and diuresis, ultimately decreasing both afterload and preload. Vasodilation reduces resistance to left ventricular ejection of blood, diminishing the heart&#x2019;s workload and improving ventricular emptying. ACE inhibitors decrease the secretion of aldosterone, a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water. ACE inhibitors also promote renal excretion of sodium and fluid (while retaining potassium), thereby reducing left ventricular filling pressure and decreasing pulmonary congestion. These agents are also recommended for prevention of HF in patients at risk due to vascular disease and diabetes (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients receiving ACE inhibitors are monitored for hypotension, hyperkalemia (increased potassium in the blood), and alterations in renal function, especially if they are also receiving diuretics. Because ACE inhibitors cause the kidneys to retain potassium, the patient who is also receiving a loop diuretic or a thiazide diuretic may not need to take oral potassium supplements. However, the patient receiving a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as an aldosterone antagonist, which does not cause potassium loss with diuresis, must be carefully monitored for hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors may be discontinued if the potassium level remains greater than 5.5 mEq/L or if the serum creatinine rises.</p>
<p class="indent">An adverse effect of ACE inhibitors includes a dry, persistent cough that may not respond to cough suppressants due to the inhibition of the enzyme kininase, which inactivates bradykinin. The nurse should carefully assess any cough in a patient taking an ACE inhibitor, as this symptom can also indicate a worsening of ventricular function and failure. In less than 1% of patients, ACE inhibitors may cause an allergic reaction accompanied by angioedema. This reaction tends to occur more frequently in African Americans and women (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). If angioedema affects the oropharyngeal area and impairs breathing, the ACE inhibitor must be stopped immediately and appropriate emergency care must be provided.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient cannot continue taking an ACE inhibitor because of development of cough, an elevated creatinine level, or hyperkalemia, an ARB, an ARNI, or a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate is prescribed (see <a href="#tt25-3">Table 25-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Angiotensin Receptor Blockers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Whereas ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ARBs, such as valsartan, block the vasoconstricting effects of angiotensin II at the angiotensin II receptors. ARBs are commonly prescribed as an alternative to ACE inhibitors, as they are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF and can provide symptomatic relief in patients with HFpEF who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). ARBs do not inhibit kininase; therefore, ARBs are not associated with the bothersome cough that occurs with some patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 801</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page802" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="802">p. 802</span></div>
<p class="h8"><strong>Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitors</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An ARNI combines an ARB with a neprilysin inhibitor. Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down natriuretic peptides. Participants with HFrEF enrolled in clinical trials who were prescribed an ARNI demonstrated a significant reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization as compared with participants prescribed an ACE inhibitor (Meyer, 2019b). Based on these findings, updated ACC/AHA guidelines advocate prescribing an ARNI as first-line angiotensin system blocker therapy for most patients with symptomatic HFrEF. However, an ARNI is reportedly a costlier option than most ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which may preclude its practical use. For patients unable to take an ARNI, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is a good alternative. An ARNI should not be administered concurrently or within 36 hours of an ACE inhibitor as concomitant dosing with both agents is associated with angioedema (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). Adverse effects associated with use of an ARNI are similar to those associated with ACE inhibitor or ARB use; therefore, the nurse should assess for hypotension, renal insufficiency, and angioedema in patients taking an ARNI (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). The first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ARNI for use in patients with HF is sacubitril-valsartan.</p>
<p class="h7">Beta-Blockers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Beta-blockers block the adverse effects of the sympathetic nervous system. They relax blood vessels, lower blood pressure, decrease afterload, and decrease cardiac workload. Beta-blockers, such as carvedilol, have been found to improve functional status and reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). In addition, beta-blockers have been recommended for patients with asymptomatic HFrEF to prevent progression and the onset of symptoms of HF, even if patients do not have a history of MI. The therapeutic effects of these drugs may not be seen for several weeks or even months (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1897">Yancy et al., 2013, Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Beta-blockers can produce a number of side effects, including dizziness, hypotension, bradycardia, fatigue, and depression. Side effects are most common in the initial few weeks of treatment. Because of the potential for side effects, beta-blockers are started at a low dose. The dose is titrated up slowly (every few weeks), with close monitoring after each dosage increase. Nurses educate patients about potential symptoms during the early phase of treatment and stress that adjustment to the drug may take several weeks. Nurses must also provide support to patients going through this symptom-provoking phase of treatment. Because beta-blockade can cause bronchiole constriction, these drugs are used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospastic diseases such as asthma.</p>
<p class="h7">Ivabradine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ivabradine is a new agent that is a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide channel blocker. It is a medication with unique electrophysiologic effects, characterized by its negative chronotropic effect on the sinoatrial node, thereby decreasing the heart rate without targeting the neurohormonal system. It is indicated as an adjunct agent to beta-blockers in patients with symptomatic HFrEF and with high resting heart rates of at least 70 bpm (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1885">Koruth, Lala, Pinney, et al., 2017</a>). It may also be beneficial for patients with HFrEF who cannot tolerate beta-blockers (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>). Adverse effects of ivabradine include bradycardia resulting in dizziness and fatigue; it is also associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Koruth et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hydralazine and Isosorbide Dinitrate</p>
<p class="nonindent">A combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate may be an alternative medication for patients who cannot take any of the three angiotensin system blockers (i.e., ACE inhibitor, ARB, and ARNI), so long as the patient&#x2019;s systolic BP is at least 90 mm Hg. Nitrates (e.g., isosorbide dinitrate) cause venous dilation, which reduces the amount of blood return to the heart and lowers preload. Hydralazine lowers systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular afterload. Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate is associated with decreased hospitalizations and improved survival in patients with HFrEF; however, these improvements are not as robust as those associated with angiotensin system blockers (Meyer, 2019b; Yancy et al., 2017). Adverse effects may include hypotension, and rarely, a lupus-type reaction (Meyer, 2019b).</p>
<p class="h7">Digitalis</p>
<p class="nonindent">For many years, digitalis (i.e., digoxin) was considered an essential agent for the treatment of HF. With the introduction of newer medications, it is not prescribed as often. Digoxin increases the force of myocardial contraction and slows conduction through the atrioventricular node. It improves contractility, increasing left ventricular output. Although the use of digoxin does not result in decreased mortality rates among patients with HFrEF, it can be effective in decreasing the symptoms of HF and may help prevent hospitalization (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). Patients with renal dysfunction and older patients should receive smaller doses of digoxin, as it is excreted through the kidneys.</p>
<p class="indent">A key concern associated with digoxin therapy is digitalis toxicity. Clinical manifestations of toxicity include anorexia, nausea, visual disturbances, confusion, and bradycardia. The serum potassium level is monitored because the effect of digoxin is enhanced in the presence of hypokalemia and digoxin toxicity may occur. A serum digoxin level is obtained if the patient&#x2019;s renal function changes or there are symptoms of toxicity.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Intravenous Infusions</p>
<p class="nonindent">IV inotropes (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine, milrinone) increase the force of myocardial contraction; as such, they may be indicated for hospitalized patients with pulmonary edema (i.e., acute decompensated HF). These agents are used for patients who do not respond to routine pharmacologic therapy and are reserved for patients with severe ventricular dysfunction, low blood pressure, or impaired perfusion and evidence of significantly depressed CO, with or without congestion. They are used with caution, as some studies have associated their use with increased mortality (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Malotte, Saguros, &#x0026; Groninger, 2018</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). Patients usually require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page803" title="803"></span>also have hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter or alternative technology (see Chapter 21). Hemodynamic data are used to assess cardiac function and volume status and to guide therapy with inotropes, vasodilators, and diuretics (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Urden, Stacy, &#x0026; Lough, 2018</a>). Patients with end-stage HF who cannot be weaned from IV inotropes may be candidates for continuous therapy at home (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Malotte et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Dopamine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dopamine is a vasopressor given to increase BP and myocardial contractility. Given at low doses, a dopamine infusion may be helpful as an adjunct therapy along with loop diuretics in improving diuresis, preserving renal function, and improving renal blood flow (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Dobutamine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dobutamine is given to patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction and hypoperfusion. A catecholamine, dobutamine stimulates the beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Its major action is to increase cardiac contractility and renal perfusion to enhance urine output. However, it also increases the heart rate and can precipitate ectopic beats and tachyarrhythmias (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Burchum &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Milrinone</p>
<p class="nonindent">Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that leads to an increase in intracellular calcium within myocardial cells, increasing their contractility (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Ayres &#x0026; Maani, 2019</a>). This agent also promotes vasodilation, resulting in decreased preload and afterload and reduced cardiac workload. Milrinone is administered IV to patients with severe HF, including patients who are waiting for heart transplantation (see Chapter 24). Because the drug causes vasodilation, the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure is monitored prior to administration; if the patient is hypovolemic, the blood pressure could drop quickly. The major side effects are hypotension and increased ventricular arrhythmias. Blood pressure and ECG are monitored closely during and following infusions of milrinone.</p>
<p class="h8">Vasodilators</p>
<p class="nonindent">Intravenous vasodilators such as IV nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide may enhance symptom relief for acutely decompensated HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). Their use is contraindicated in patients who are hypotensive. Blood pressure is continually assessed in patients receiving IV vasodilator infusions.</p>
<p class="h7">Adjunct Medications for Heart Failure</p>
<p class="nonindent">The importance of ensuring that patients with hypertension take prescribed antihypertensive agents as prescribed is of paramount importance (see Chapter 27 for further discussion of antihypertensive medications). Target blood pressures should be less than 130/80 mm Hg. Maintaining BPs at these levels is associated with reduced likelihood of morbid progression to symptomatic HF in patients who are asymptomatic. It is also associated with improved morbidity in patients who are symptomatic with both HFrEF and HFpEF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Anemia is independently associated with HF disease severity, and iron deficiency appears to be uniquely associated with reduced exercise capacity. IV iron repletion in patients with HF may improve functional capacity and quality of life; however, there is mixed evidence to support the use of oral iron supplementation. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents, such as darbepoetin alfa, are not recommended in patients with both HF and anemia as a risk of thromboembolic events associated with their use has been observed during clinical trials (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Anticoagulants may be prescribed, especially if the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation or a thromboembolic event. Antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone may be prescribed for patients with arrhythmias, along with an evaluation for device therapy with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (see Chapter 22). Medications to manage hyperlipidemia (e.g., statins) are also routinely prescribed, in tandem with guidance on nutritional therapy (see following section). It is recommended that patients with HF avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen because the risk of decreased renal perfusion is higher, especially in older adults (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1893">Schwartz, Schmader, Hanlon, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Adjunct Therapies for Heart Failure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Additional therapies that may be indicated in the treatment of patients with HF include nutritional therapy, supplemental oxygen, management of sleep disorders, and procedural or surgical interventions.</p>
<p class="h7">Nutritional Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Following a low sodium (no more than 2 g/day) diet and avoiding excessive fluid intake are usually recommended, although studies differ regarding the effectiveness of sodium restriction (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). Decreasing dietary sodium reduces fluid retention and the symptoms of peripheral and pulmonary congestion. The purpose of sodium restriction is to decrease the amount of circulating blood volume, which decreases myocardial work. A balance should be achieved between the patient&#x2019;s ability to adhere to the diet and the recommended guidelines.</p>
<p class="indent">Nutritional supplements, such as vitamins and antioxidants, are not recommended for patients with HF as no benefits are associated with their use. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation is associated with decreased fatal cardiovascular events and is recommended for patients with either HFrEF or HFpEF, unless contraindicated (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Any change in eating patterns should consider good nutrition as well as the patient&#x2019;s likes, dislikes, and cultural food patterns. Patient adherence is important because dietary indiscretions may result in exacerbations of HF symptoms. However, behavioral changes in eating patterns are difficult for many patients to achieve.</p>
<p class="h7">Supplemental Oxygen</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen therapy may become necessary as HF progresses based on the degree of pulmonary congestion and resulting hypoxia. Some patients require supplemental oxygen only during periods of activity (see Chapter 20 for further discussion of oxygen delivery systems).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 803</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page804" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="804">p. 804</span></div>
<p class="h7">Management of Sleep Disorders</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, are common in patients with HF. It is estimated that 61% of patients with HF have either central or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A formal sleep study should be performed. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) might be recommended if results from the sleep study suggest OSA (see Chapter 18). CPAP has been shown to improve sleep quality, reduce apneic episodes and excessive daytime sleepiness, and improve nocturnal oxygenation in patients with OSA and HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Procedural and Surgical Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">A number of procedures and surgical approaches may benefit patients with HF. If the patient has underlying CAD, coronary artery revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery (see Chapter 23) may be considered. Ventricular function may improve in some patients when coronary flow is increased.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with HF are at high risk for arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death is common among patients with advanced HF. In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and the possibility of life-threatening arrhythmias, placement of an ICD can prevent sudden cardiac death and extend survival (see Chapter 22). Candidates for an ICD include those with an EF less than 35%, including those with and without a history of ventricular arrhythmias (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with HF who do not improve with standard therapy may benefit from <strong>cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)</strong>. CRT involves the use of a biventricular pacemaker to treat electrical conduction defects and to synchronize ventricular contractions. A prolonged QRS duration on ECG indicates left bundle branch block, which is a type of delayed conduction that is frequently seen in patients with HF. This problem results in asynchronous conduction and contraction of the right and left ventricles, which can further decrease EF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). The use of a pacing device with leads placed in the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricular cardiac vein can synchronize the contractions of the right and left ventricles (Fig. 25-3). This intervention improves CO, optimizes myocardial energy consumption, reduces mitral regurgitation, and slows the ventricular remodeling process. For patients with a CRT, improvement of left ventricular EF is associated with reduced rates of ventricular arrhythmias. There are combination devices available for patients who require CRT and an ICD (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Gulati &#x0026; Udelson, 2018</a>). See Chapter 22 for further discussion of care of patients with pacemakers, CRT, and ICDs.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrafiltration is an alternative intervention for patients with severe fluid overload. It is reserved for patients with advanced HF who are resistant to diuretic therapy (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>). A dual-lumen central IV catheter is placed, and the patient&#x2019;s blood is circulated through a small bedside filtration machine. Liters of excess fluid and plasma are removed slowly from the patient&#x2019;s intravascular circulating volume over a number of hours. The patient&#x2019;s output of filtration fluid, blood pressure, and hemoglobin (analyzed for hemoconcentration) are monitored as indicators of volume status. Research on ultrafiltration is ongoing, and targets comparisons of its efficacy to diuretics and the optimal fluid removal target (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Costanzo, 2019</a>).</p>

To pace both ventricles, pacemaker leads are placed in the right atrium and right ventricle; a third lead is threaded through the coronary sinus into a lateral vein on the wall of the left ventricle.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">For some patients with end-stage HF, cardiac transplantation is one of the few options for long-term survival. Patients with ACC/AHA stage D HF who may be eligible are referred for consideration of transplantation. Some of these patients require mechanical circulatory assistance with an implanted ventricular assist device as a bridge therapy to cardiac transplantation. A left ventricular assist device may also be implanted as <em>destination therapy</em> (permanent therapy) for select patients (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s934"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several normal age-related changes increase the frequency of HF: increased systolic blood pressure, increased ventricular wall thickness, and increased myocardial fibrosis. There are a number of reasons that older adults may need to be hospitalized with HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1860">Albert, Barnason, Deswal, et al., 2015</a>). Older adults may not always detect or accurately interpret common symptoms of HF such as shortness of breath, or they may have atypical symptoms such as weakness and somnolence. Decreased renal function can make the older patient resistant to diuretics and more sensitive to changes in volume. The administration of diuretics to older men requires nursing surveillance for bladder distention caused by urethral obstruction from an enlarged prostate gland. The bladder may be assessed with an ultrasound scanner or the suprapubic area palpated for an oval mass and percussed for dullness, indicative of bladder fullness. Urinary frequency and urgency may be particularly stressful to older patients, as many have arthritis and limited mobility.</p>

<p class="processppara">Despite advances in treatment of HF, morbidity and mortality remain high. Nurses have a major impact on outcomes for patients with HF, especially in the areas of patient education and monitoring.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing assessment for the patient with HF focuses on observing for effectiveness of therapy and for the patient&#x2019;s ability to understand and implement self-care management strategies. Signs and symptoms of worsening HF are analyzed and reported to the patient&#x2019;s provider so that therapy can be adjusted. The nurse also explores the patient&#x2019;s emotional response to the diagnosis of HF, because it is a chronic and often progressive condition that is commonly associated with depression and other psychosocial issues (Jiang, Shorey, Seah, et al., 2018).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health history:&lt;/b&gt; the collection of subjective data, most often a series of questions that provides an overview of the patient&#x2019;s current health status">Health History</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The health history focuses on the signs and symptoms of HF, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. Sleep disturbances, particularly sleep suddenly interrupted by shortness of breath, may be reported. Patients are asked about the number of pillows needed for sleep, edema, abdominal symptoms, altered mental status, activities of daily living, and the activities that cause fatigue. Nurses need to be aware of the variety of clinical manifestations that may indicate worsening HF and assess the patient accordingly. While obtaining the patient&#x2019;s history, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of HF, self-care management strategies, and the patient&#x2019;s ability and willingness to adhere to those strategies.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;physical examination:&lt;/b&gt; collection of objective data about the patient&#x2019;s health status">Physical Examination</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is observed for restlessness and anxiety that might suggest hypoxia from pulmonary congestion. The patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness is also evaluated for any changes, as low CO can decrease the flow of oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The rate and depth of respirations are assessed along with the effort required for breathing. The lungs are auscultated to detect crackles and wheezes (Meyer, 2019a). Crackles are produced by the sudden opening of edematous narrowed airways and alveoli. They may be heard at the end of inspiration and are not cleared with coughing. Wheezing may also be heard in some patients who have bronchospasm along with pulmonary congestion.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The blood pressure is carefully evaluated, because patients with HF may present with hypotension or hypertension. Patients may be assessed for orthostatic hypotension, especially if they report lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope. The heart is auscultated for an S<sub>3</sub> heart sound, which is an early sign that increased blood volume fills the ventricle with each beat. Heart rate and rhythm are also documented, and patients are often placed on continuous ECG monitoring in the hospital setting. When the heart rate is rapid or very slow, the CO decreases and potentially worsens the HF. JVD is assessed with the patient sitting at a 45-degree angle; distention greater than 4 cm above the sternal angle is considered abnormal and indicative of right ventricular failure (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Bickley, 2017</a>). This is an estimate, not a precise measurement, of high central venous pressure.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses peripheral pulses and rates their volume on a scale from 0 (not palpable) to 3+ (bounding). The skin is also assessed for color and temperature. With significant decreases in SV, there is a decrease in perfusion to the periphery, decreasing the volume of pulses and causing the skin to feel cool and appear pale or cyanotic. The feet and lower legs are examined for edema; if the patient is supine in bed, the sacrum and back are also assessed for edema. The upper extremities may also become edematous in some patients. Edema is typically rated on a scale from 0 (no edema) to 4+ (severe pitting edema).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The abdomen is examined for tenderness and hepatomegaly. The presence of firmness, distention, and possible ascites is noted. The liver may be assessed for hepatojugular reflux. The patient is asked to breathe normally while manual pressure is applied over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for 30&#x2013;60 s. If neck vein distention increases more than 1 cm, the finding is positive for increased venous pressure.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient is hospitalized, the nurse measures urinary output and evaluates it in terms of diuretic use. Intake and output records are rigorously maintained and analyzed. It is important to track whether the patient has excreted excessive volume (i.e., negative fluid balance is generally the goal). The intake and output is then compared with changes in weight. Although diuresis is expected, the patient with HF must also be monitored for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;oliguria:&lt;/b&gt; diminished urine output; less than 0.5 mL/kg/h over at least 6 hours, or less than 400 mL in 24 hours">oliguria</button></strong> (diminished urine output, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 h or &#x003C;400 mL/24 h) or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anuria:&lt;/b&gt; urine output of less than 50 mL/24 h">anuria</button></strong> (urine output of less than 50 mL/24 h) because of the risk of renal dysfunction.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is weighed daily in the hospital or at home, at the same time of day, with the same type of clothing, and on the same scale. If there is a significant change in weight (i.e., 2&#x2013;3-lb increase in a day or 5-lb increase in a wk), the primary provider is notified and medications are adjusted (e.g., the diuretic dose is increased).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Major goals for the patient may include promoting activity and reducing fatigue, relieving fluid overload symptoms, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page806" title="806"></span>decreasing anxiety or increasing the patient&#x2019;s ability to manage anxiety, encouraging the patient to verbalize their ability to make decisions and influence outcomes, and educating the patient and family about health management.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing interventions revolve around promoting the patient&#x2019;s activity tolerance, managing the patient&#x2019;s fluid volume status, assisting the patient so that anxiety is relieved, helping to minimize any feelings of powerlessness that the patient might experience, and assisting the patient and family members to effectively manage the patient&#x2019;s health. In addition, nursing interventions must be attuned to prevent and manage acute complications that can be experienced by patients with HF.</p>

<p class="processppara">Reduced physical activity caused by HF symptoms leads to physical deconditioning that worsens the patient&#x2019;s symptoms and exercise tolerance. Prolonged inactivity, which may be self-imposed, should be avoided because of its deconditioning effects and risks, such as pressure injuries (especially in edematous patients) and venous thromboembolism. An acute illness that exacerbates HF symptoms or requires hospitalization may be an indication for temporary bed rest. Otherwise, some type of physical activity every day should be encouraged. A typical program for a patient with HF might include a daily walking regimen, with the duration increased over a 6-wk period. The primary provider, nurse, and patient collaborate to develop a schedule that promotes pacing and prioritization of activities. The schedule should alternate activities with periods of rest and avoid having two significant energy-consuming activities occur on the same day or in immediate succession. Before undertaking physical activity, the patient should be given guidelines similar to those noted in <a href="#ct25-3">Chart 25-3</a>. Because some patients may be severely debilitated, they may need to limit physical activities to only 3&#x2013;5 min at a time, one to four times per day. The patient should increase the duration of the activity, then the frequency, before increasing the intensity of the activity (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1892">Pi&#x00F1;a, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>An Exercise Program for Patients with Heart Failure</strong></strong></p>

</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Barriers to performing activities are identified, and methods of adjusting an activity are discussed. For example, vegetables can be chopped or peeled while sitting at the kitchen table rather than standing at the kitchen counter. Small, frequent meals decrease the amount of energy needed for digestion while providing adequate nutrition. The nurse helps the patient identify peak and low periods of energy, planning energy-consuming activities for peak periods. For example, the patient may prepare the meals for the entire day in the morning. Pacing and prioritizing activities help maintain the patient&#x2019;s energy to promote participation in regular physical activity.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s response to activities needs to be monitored. If the patient is hospitalized, vital signs and oxygen saturation levels are monitored before, during, and immediately after an activity to identify whether they are within the desired range. Heart rate should return to baseline within 3 min following the activity. If the patient is at home, the degree of fatigue felt after the activity can be used to assess the response. If the patient tolerates the activity, short- and long-term goals can be developed to gradually increase the intensity, duration, and frequency of activity.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Adherence to exercise training is essential if the patient is to benefit from it, but it may be difficult for patients with other comorbid conditions (e.g., arthritis, anemia, cardiomyopathy, obesity, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and those who have had HF for a longer time (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1869">Cattadori, Segurini, Picozzi, et al., 2018</a>). Referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program may be indicated, especially for patients newly diagnosed with HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1892">Pi&#x00F1;a, 2019</a>). A supervised program may also benefit those who need a structured environment, significant educational support, regular encouragement, and interpersonal contact.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with severe HF may receive IV diuretic therapy; however, patients with less severe symptoms are typically prescribed oral diuretics. Oral diuretics should be given early in the morning so that diuresis does not interfere with the patient&#x2019;s nighttime rest. Discussing the timing of medication administration is especially important for older patients who may have urinary urgency or incontinence. A single dose of a diuretic may cause the patient to excrete a large volume of fluid shortly after its administration.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s fluid status is monitored closely by auscultating the lungs, monitoring daily body weight, and assisting the patient to adhere to a low sodium diet by reading food labels and avoiding high sodium foods such as canned, processed, and convenience foods (<a href="#ct25-4">Chart 25-4</a>). Weight gain in a patient with HF almost always reflects fluid retention. If the diet includes fluid restriction, the nurse can assist the patient to plan fluid intake throughout the day while respecting the patient&#x2019;s dietary preferences. If the patient is receiving IV fluids and medications, the amount of fluid needs to be monitored closely, and the primary provider or pharmacist can be consulted about the possibility of maximizing the amount of medication in the same volume of IV fluid (e.g., double concentrating to decrease the fluid volume given).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is positioned or taught how to assume a position that facilitates breathing. The number of pillows may be increased, the head of the bed may be elevated, or the patient may sit in a recliner. In these positions, the venous return to the heart (preload) is reduced, pulmonary congestion is reduced, and pressure on the diaphragm is minimized. The lower arms can be supported with pillows to eliminate the fatigue caused by the pull of the patient&#x2019;s weight on the shoulder muscles. If the patient is experiencing acute decompensation, positioning them upright, preferably with the legs dangling over the side of the bed, has the immediate effect of decreasing venous return, decreasing right ventricular stroke volume, and decreasing lung congestion.</p>

<div class="box15">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Facts About Dietary Sodium</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">Although the major source of sodium in the average American diet is salt, many types of natural foods contain varying amounts of sodium. Even if no salt is added in cooking and if salty foods are avoided, the daily diet will still contain about 2000 mg of sodium. Fresh fruits and vegetables are low in sodium and should be encouraged.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Additives in Food</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">In general, food prepared at home is lower in sodium than restaurant or processed foods. Added food substances (additives), such as sodium alginate, which improves food texture, sodium benzoate, which acts as a preservative, and disodium phosphate, which improves cooking quality in certain foods, increase the sodium intake when included in the daily diet. Therefore, patients on low sodium diets should be advised to check labels carefully for words such as &#x201C;salt&#x201D; or &#x201C;sodium,&#x201D; especially on canned foods. For example, without looking at the sodium content per serving found on the nutrition labels, when given a choice between a serving of potato chips and a cup of canned cream of mushroom soup, most would think that soup is lower in sodium. However, when the labels are examined, the lower sodium choice is found to be the chips. Although potato chips are <em>not</em> recommended in a low sodium diet, this example illustrates that it is important to read food labels to determine both sodium content and serving size.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nonfood Sodium Sources</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">Sodium is contained in municipal water. Water softeners also increase the sodium content of drinking water. Patients on sodium-restricted diets should be cautioned against using nonprescription medications such as antacids, cough syrups, and laxatives. Salt substitutes may be allowed, but it is recognized that they are high in potassium. Over-the-counter medications should not be used without first consulting the patient&#x2019;s primary provider.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Promoting Dietary Adherence</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">If patients find food unpalatable because of the dietary sodium restrictions and/or the taste disturbances caused by the medications, they may refuse to eat or to follow the dietary regimen. For this reason, severe sodium restrictions should be avoided, and diuretic medication should be balanced with the patient&#x2019;s ability to restrict dietary sodium. A variety of flavorings, such as lemon juice, vinegar, and herbs, may be used to improve the taste of the food and facilitate acceptance of the diet. It is important to consider the patient&#x2019;s food preferences. Diet counseling and educational handouts can be geared toward a patient&#x2013;family-centered approach and with cultural practices considered.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Because decreased circulation in edematous areas increases the risk of pressure injuries, the nurse assesses for skin breakdown and institutes preventive measures. Positioning to avoid pressure and frequent changes of position help prevent pressure injuries.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with HF may exhibit signs and symptoms of anxiety. In addition to psychosocial sources of anxiety, the physiologic compensatory mechanisms include activation of neurohormones including catecholamines. Complex medical interventions, such as implantation of an ICD can provoke anxiety in patients and families. These sources of anxiety include living with the threat of shocks, role changes, and concerns about the patient&#x2019;s ability to carry out activities of daily living. The patient&#x2019;s anxiety may intensify at night and interfere with sleep. Emotional stress further stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, causing vasoconstriction, elevated arterial pressure, and increased heart rate. This sympathetic response increases cardiac workload.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When the patient exhibits anxiety, the nurse takes steps to promote physical comfort and provide psychological support. As mentioned previously, the patient may be more comfortable sitting in a recliner. Oxygen may be given during an acute event to diminish the work of breathing and increase the patient&#x2019;s comfort. In many cases, a family member&#x2019;s presence provides reassurance. Patients with HF rely on their families for many aspects of care; therefore, nurses should assess the needs of family caregivers and provide support to them (Hodson, Peacock, &#x0026; Holtslander, 2019).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Along with reassurance, the nurse can begin educating the patient and family about techniques for controlling anxiety and avoiding anxiety-provoking situations. This includes how to identify factors that contribute to anxiety and how to use relaxation techniques to control anxious feelings. As the patient&#x2019;s anxiety decreases, cardiac function may improve and symptoms of HF may decrease.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with HF may feel overwhelmed with their diagnosis and treatment regimen, leading to feelings of powerlessness. Contributing factors may include lack of knowledge and lack of opportunity to make decisions, particularly if health care providers or family members do not encourage the patient to participate in the treatment decision-making process.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nurses should help patients recognize their choices, and that they can positively influence the outcomes of their diagnosis and treatment. Taking time to listen actively to patients encourages them to express their concerns and ask questions. Other strategies include providing the patient with decision making opportunities, such as when activities are to occur, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page808" title="808"></span>or encouraging food and fluid choices consistent with the dietary restrictions. Encouragement is provided, progress is identified, and the patient is assisted to differentiate between factors that can and cannot be controlled.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to feelings of powerlessness, patients with HF have a high incidence of depressive symptoms, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Jiang et al., 2018). Because depressive symptoms are known to increase as the disease worsens, patients with HF need to be screened for depression so that it can be treated, hopefully maintaining the patient&#x2019;s functional status and quality of life.</p>

<p class="processppara">Therapeutic regimens for HF are complex and require the patient and family to make significant lifestyle changes. An inability or unwillingness to adhere to dietary and pharmacologic recommendations can lead to episodes of acute decompensated HF and hospitalization. Nonadherence with prescribed diet and fluid restrictions and medications cause many hospital readmissions. Nursing research findings suggest that for some patients with HF who are taking more than one medication daily, the decision to not take HF medications as prescribed may actually reflect their efforts to best manage their personal health, and, therefore, may be a self-care strategy (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct25-5">Chart 25-5</a>) (Meraz, 2020).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nurses have a key role in managing episodes of acute decompensated HF and in developing a comprehensive education and discharge plan to prevent hospital readmissions and increase the patient&#x2019;s quality of life. Because of the high cost of hospitalization for HF, the Centers for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a program that reduces reimbursement to hospitals with a high 30-d readmission rate (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2019). Research continues to identify the most effective interventions that may decrease these rates. A number of evidence-based components are known to increase the effectiveness of a discharge plan for patients with HF, including providing them with comprehensive, patient-centered instructions, scheduling follow-up visits with their primary providers within 7 d of discharge, and following up by telephone within 3 d of discharge (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2013</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Because HF is a complex and progressive condition, patients are at risk for many complications, including acute decompensated HF and pulmonary edema; hypotension and cardiogenic shock (see Chapter 11); arrhythmias (see Chapter 22); thromboembolism formation (see Chapter 26); and pericardial effusion (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="spanprocess">Pulmonary Edema.</span> As described previously, pulmonary edema is associated with acute decompensated HF that can lead to acute respiratory failure and death. If it is recognized early, pulmonary edema may be alleviated by increasing dosages of diuretics and by implementing other interventions to decrease preload. For instance, placing the patient in an upright position with the feet and legs dependent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page809" title="809"></span>reduces left ventricular workload. The treatment regimen and the patient&#x2019;s understanding of and adherence to it are assessed. The long-range approach for preventing pulmonary edema must be directed at identifying and managing its precipitating factors.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Meraz, R. (2020). Medication nonadherence or self-care? Understanding the medication decision-making process and experiences of older adults with heart failure. <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>35</em>(1), 26&#x2013;34.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">It is estimated that over half of patients with heart failure do not take their medications as prescribed. The reasons why many patients with heart failure do not adhere to their prescribed medication regimen are elusive, particularly since nonadherence is associated with hospitalization and emergency department visits. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to discover why patients with heart failure might not take their heart failure medications as prescribed.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">This was a qualitative study that used narrative inquiry and storytelling to discover why community dwelling patients with heart failure might not adhere to their medication regimen. Eleven participants, all 65 y of age or older, volunteered to be interviewed. Each of these participants had to live independently in the community setting, had to take at least two medications daily to treat heart failure, and had to self-administer these medications in order to be eligible to participate in this study.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">Results from participant interviews found that patients&#x2019; nonadherence with the prescribed medication regimen was deliberate, and not because of forgetfulness. In all reported instances, it was not contingent upon financial constraints, either. Some participants stopped taking a medication while others adjusted the dosages. Participants&#x2019; deliberate decisions to adjust their medication regimen tended to be made based on the belief that they knew their own bodies and needs best, and felt that they were best equipped to take care of their own needs. Others noted that at times it was too difficult to get in contact with their primary providers or nurses, and that their primary providers or nurses were too busy to discuss their medication regimen with them. Most noted that they researched online their medications&#x2019; effects and felt competent to manage their medication dosage without necessarily consulting their providers. Paradoxically, participants did not view their decisions to self-adjust their prescribed medication regimens as consonant with nonadherence.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA_left">Patients with heart failure who are prescribed multiple medications to treat their heart failure may not view self-adjustment of their prescriptions as tantamount to nonadherence. It seems likely that these self-care/nonadherent practices place these patients at risk for hospitalization and morbid complications. Participants in this study noted that one key reason that they self-adjusted their medications was because their primary providers and nurses were &#x201C;too busy&#x201D; to talk to them about their medications. Nurses are in an ideal position to talk to patients with heart failure about their prescriptions, discover their concerns about their medications, help them find ways to problem-solve and manage side effects, and help them proactively engage in self-care so that they avoid hospitalization.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Clinical management of a patient with acute pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure is directed toward reducing volume overload, improving ventricular function, and increasing oxygenation. These goals are accomplished through a combination of oxygen and ventilatory support, IV medication, and nursing assessment and interventions.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s airway and breathing are assessed to determine the severity of respiratory distress, along with vital signs. The patient is placed on pulse oximetry, a cardiac monitor, and IV access is confirmed or established for administration of medications. Laboratory tests are obtained, including arterial blood gases, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine; other laboratory tests that may be indicated include a complete blood cell count (CBC), BNP, or a serum troponin-I. A chest x-ray or an ultrasound of the lungs may be obtained to confirm the extent of pulmonary edema (Meyer, 2019a).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Oxygen is given in concentrations adequate to relieve hypoxemia and dyspnea; a non-rebreathing mask may be used initially. If respiratory failure is severe or persists, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation is the preferred mode of assisted ventilation (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Colucci, 2019</a>). For some patients, endotracheal (ET) intubation and mechanical ventilation are required. The ventilator can provide positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which is effective in reducing venous return, decreasing fluid movement from the pulmonary capillaries to the alveoli, and improving oxygenation (see Chapter 19). Oxygenation is monitored by pulse oximetry and by measurement of arterial blood gases.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient who is experiencing pulmonary edema is likely going to be highly anxious, as are the patient&#x2019;s family members. As the ability to breathe decreases, the patient&#x2019;s fear and anxiety rise proportionately, making the condition more severe. Reassuring the patient and family and providing skillful anticipatory nursing care are integral parts of the therapy. Because the patient is in an unstable condition, the nurse must remain with the patient. The nurse gives the patient simple, concise information in a reassuring voice about what is being done to treat the condition and the expected results.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Vasodilators such as IV nitroglycerin or nitroprusside may enhance symptom relief in pulmonary edema, as previously described (Meyer, 2019a). Blood pressure is continually assessed in patients receiving IV vasodilator infusions.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Furosemide or another loop diuretic is given by IV push or as a continuous infusion to produce a rapid diuretic effect. The blood pressure is closely monitored as the urine output increases, because it is possible for the patient to become hypotensive as intravascular volume decreases. The patient receiving diuretic therapy may excrete a large volume of urine within minutes after a potent diuretic is given. A bedside commode may be used to decrease the energy required by the patient and to reduce the resultant increase in cardiac workload induced by getting on and off a bedpan. If necessary, in order to carefully monitor urine output, an indwelling urinary catheter may be inserted.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Once the patient is stable, they may transition to oral diuretics; intake and output, daily weights, serum electrolytes, and creatinine are carefully monitored.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Many potential problems associated with HF therapy relate to the use of diuretics. These problems require ongoing nursing assessment and collaborative intervention:</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Excessive and repeated diuresis can lead to hypokalemia (i.e., potassium depletion). Signs include ventricular arrhythmias, hypotension, muscle weakness, and generalized weakness. In patients receiving digoxin, hypokalemia can lead to digitalis toxicity, which increases the likelihood of dangerous arrhythmias. Patients with HF may also develop low levels of magnesium, which can add to the risk of arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia may occur, especially with the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or spironolactone. Hyperkalemia can also lead to profound bradycardia and other arrhythmias. Prolonged diuretic therapy may produce hyponatremia (deficiency of sodium in the blood), which can result in disorientation, weakness, muscle cramps, and anorexia. Volume depletion from excessive fluid loss may lead to dehydration and hypotension. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may contribute to the hypotension. Other problems associated with diuretics include increased serum creatinine (indicative of renal dysfunction) and hyperuricemia (excessive uric acid in the blood), which leads to gout.</p>

<p class="processppara">Facilitating an easy and smooth transition back into the community is of paramount importance for the patient living with HF. Community-based nursing interventions for patients with HF can improve health outcomes and health care value as evidenced by reduced hospital readmissions for up to 6 mo. Important nursing interventions that keep the patient with HF out of the hospital incorporate a multidisciplinary care planning approach (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1882">Jones, Bowles, Richard, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="spanprocess">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The nurse provides patient education and involves the patient and family in the therapeutic regimen to promote understanding and adherence to the plan. When the patient recognizes that the diagnosis of HF can be successfully managed with lifestyle changes and medications, recurrences of acute HF lessen, unnecessary hospitalizations decrease, and life expectancy increases. Nurses play a key role in educating patients and their families about medication management, a low sodium diet, moderate alcohol consumption, activity and exercise recommendations, smoking cessation, how to recognize the signs and symptoms of worsening HF, and when to contact the primary provider (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Jones et al., 2017</a>). Use of the teach-back technique to assess the patient&#x2019;s comprehension of the instructions can increase education effectiveness and prevent rehospitalization (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1877">Esquivel, White, Carroll, et al., 2018</a>) (see Chapter 3 for further discussion of teach-back methods). In order for teach-back to be effective, the nurse must ensure adequate time is dedicated to ensuring that patient learning occurs (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Esquivel et al., 2018</a>). A basic home education plan for the patient with HF is presented in <a href="#ct25-6">Chart 25-6</a>. The patient should receive a written copy of the instructions.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s readiness to learn and potential barriers to learning are assessed. Patients with HF may have temporary or ongoing cognitive impairment due to their illness or other factors, increasing the need to rely on an identified caretaker (Hodson et al., 2019). An effective treatment plan incorporates both the patient&#x2019;s goals and those of the health care providers. The nurse must consider cultural factors and adapt the education plan accordingly. Patients and families need to understand that effective HF management is influenced by choices made about treatment options and their ability to follow the treatment plan. They also need to be informed that health care providers are available to assist them in reaching their health care goals.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="spanprocess">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Successful management of HF requires adherence to a complex medical regimen that includes multiple lifestyle changes for most patients. Assistance may be provided through a number of options that optimize evidence-based recommendations for effective management of HF. Depending on the patient&#x2019;s physical status and the availability of family assistance, a home care referral or another type of disease management program may be indicated for a patient who has been hospitalized. Transitional care programs (hospital to home) that include telephone contact along with home visits have been shown to decrease rehospitalizations and increase patient quality of life (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Cyrille &#x0026; Patel, 2017</a>; <a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Jones et al., 2017</a>). Home visits by nurses who are specially trained in managing patients with HF provide assessment and management tailored to specific individualized patient needs. Older patients and those who have long-standing heart disease with compromised physical stamina often require assistance with the transition to home after hospitalization for an acute episode of HF. The home health nurse assesses the physical environment of the home and makes suggestions for adapting the home environment to meet the patient&#x2019;s activity limitations. If stairs are a concern, the patient can plan the day&#x2019;s activities so that stair-climbing is minimized; for some patients, a temporary bedroom may be set up on the main level of the home. The home health nurse works with the patient and family to maximize the benefits of these changes.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The home health nurse also reinforces and clarifies information about dietary changes and fluid restrictions, the need to monitor symptoms and daily body weight, and the importance of obtaining follow-up care with the primary provider&#x2019;s office or clinic. Assistance may be given in scheduling and keeping appointments as well. The patient is encouraged to gradually increase their self-care and responsibility for carrying out the therapeutic regimen.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Evidence-based HF guidelines also recommend patient referral to HF clinics, which provide intensive nursing management along with medical care in a collaborative model. Many of these clinics are managed by advanced practice nurses. Referral to an HF clinic gives the patient ready access to continuing education, professional nursing and medical staff, and timely adjustments to treatment regimens. HF clinics can also provide outpatient treatment (e.g., IV diuretics, laboratory monitoring) as an alternative to hospitalization. Because of the additional support and coordination of care, patients managed through HF clinics have fewer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page811" title="811"></span>exacerbations of HF, fewer hospitalizations, decreased costs of medical care, and increased quality of life (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Yancy, 2013</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Other disease management programs are carried out through telehealth, using telephones or computers to maintain contact with patients and to obtain patient data. This enables nurses and others to assess and manage patients on a frequent basis, without requiring patients to make frequent visits to health care providers. A variety of techniques ranging from simple telephone monitoring to sophisticated computer and video connections that monitor symptoms, daily weight, vital signs, heart sounds, and breath sounds may be used. Patient data may also include hemodynamics and other parameters transmitted from implantable devices. Studies have shown that telehealth management can decrease costs and hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of HF (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1884">Koehler, Koehler, Deckwart, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="spanprocess">End-of-Life Considerations.</span> Because HF is a chronic and often progressive condition, patients and families need to consider issues related to the end-of-life and when palliative or hospice care should be considered (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1874">Cross, Kamal, Taylor, et al., 2019</a>). Although the prognosis in patients with HF may be uncertain, issues often arise sooner or later related to the patient&#x2019;s thoughts and possible concerns about the use of complex treatment options (e.g., implantation of an ICD or a ventricular assist device [VAD]). VADs are an option for some patients with HF who have failed medical therapy and who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation. Discussions concerning the use of technology, preferences for end-of-life care, and advance directives should take place while the patient is able to participate and express preferences. For example, with the expanded use of ICDs in the HF population, patients with ICDs, their families, and their primary providers should receive instructions for ICD inactivation at the end-of-life to prevent inappropriate discharges. See Chapter 13 for further discussion of end-of-life care.</p>
