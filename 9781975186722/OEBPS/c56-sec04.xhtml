<h4 class="h4" id="s2596">General Pruritus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Itch receptors are unmyelinated, penicillate (brushlike) nerve endings that are found exclusively in the skin, mucous membranes, and cornea. Although pruritus is usually caused by primary skin disease with resultant rash or lesions, it may occur without a rash or lesion. This is referred to as essential pruritus, which generally has a rapid onset, may be severe, and interferes with normal daily activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Pruritus may be the first indication of a systemic internal disease such as diabetes, blood disorders, or cancer (occult malignancy of the breast or colon, lymphoma). It may also accompany kidney, hepatic, and thyroid diseases (Chart&#x00A0;56-3). Some common oral medications such as aspirin, antibiotics, hormones (e.g., estrogens, testosterone, or oral contraceptives), and opioids (e.g., morphine) may cause pruritus directly or by increasing sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light. Certain soaps and chemicals, radiation therapy, miliaria (prickly heat), and contact with woolen garments are associated with pruritus as well. Pruritus may also be caused by psychological factors, such as excessive stress in family or work situations, and is called <em>psychogenic pruritus</em> (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Song et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2597"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pruritus occurs frequently in older adults as a result of dry skin. Older adults are also more likely to have a systemic illness that triggers pruritus, are at higher risk for occult malignancy, and are more likely to be taking multiple medications than younger people. All of these factors increase the incidence of pruritus in older adults (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2598">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Scratching the pruritic area causes the inflamed cells and nerve endings to release histamine, which produces more pruritus, generating a vicious itch&#x2013;scratch cycle. If the patient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1830" title="1830"></span>responds to an itch by scratching, the integrity of the skin may be altered, and excoriation, redness, wheals (raised areas), infection, or changes in pigmentation may result. Pruritus usually is more severe at night and is less frequently reported during waking hours, probably because the person is distracted by daily activities. At night, when there are fewer distractions, the slightest pruritus cannot be easily ignored. Severe itching can be debilitating (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bolier, Elferink, &#x0026; Beuers, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2599">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A thorough history and physical examination usually provide clues to the underlying cause of the pruritus, such as hay fever, allergy, recent administration of a new medication, or a change of cosmetics or soaps. After the cause has been identified, treatment of the condition should relieve the pruritus. Signs of infection and environmental clues, such as warm, dry air or irritating bed linens, should be identified. In general, washing with soap and hot water is avoided. Bath oils containing a surfactant that allows the oil to mix with bathwater (e.g., Lubath&#x2122;, Alpha Keri&#x2122;) may be sufficient for cleaning. However, an older adult patient or a patient with unsteady balance should avoid adding oil because it increases the danger of slipping in the bathtub. A warm bath with a mild soap followed by application of a bland emollient to moist skin can control xerosis. Tepid baths, or applying cool compresses or cool agents that contain menthol and camphor (which constrict blood vessels) may also help relieve pruritus (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cornish, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Topical antipruritic agents (e.g., lidocaine, prilocaine) or capsaicin cream may be useful in providing relief from localized pruritus. Topical corticosteroids are effective when used to diminish pruritus that occurs secondary to inflammatory conditions because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Oral antihistamines are frequently prescribed and may be effective when the pruritus is nocturnal, particularly agents such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine, which also cause somnolence, resulting in a restful and comfortable sleep. Other nonsedating antihistamines are not beneficial in relieving pruritus. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) may be effective, particularly in patients with pruritus that is secondary to cholestasis or the uremia of chronic kidney disease (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bolier et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Song et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2600">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse reinforces the reasons for the prescribed therapeutic regimen and educates the patient about specific points of care. The effectiveness of therapy may be gauged by asking the patient to rate the extent of itching pre- and posttherapy (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bolier et al., 2016</a>). If baths have been prescribed, the patient is reminded to use tepid (not hot) water and to shake off the excess water and blot between intertriginous areas (body folds) with a towel. Rubbing vigorously with the towel is avoided because this overstimulates the skin and causes more itching. It also removes water from the stratum corneum. Immediately after bathing, the skin should be lubricated with an emollient to trap moisture.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is instructed to avoid situations that cause vasodilation. Examples include exposure to an overly warm environment and ingestion of alcohol or hot foods and liquids, all of which can induce or intensify pruritus. Using a humidifier is helpful if environmental air is dry. Activities that result in perspiration should be limited because perspiration may irritate and promote pruritus. If itching interferes with sleep, the nurse can advise the patient to wear cotton clothing next to the skin rather than synthetic materials. The room should be kept cool and humidified. Vigorous scratching should be avoided and nails kept trimmed to prevent skin damage and infection. When the underlying cause of pruritus is unknown and further testing is required, the nurse explains each test and its expected outcome.</p>
