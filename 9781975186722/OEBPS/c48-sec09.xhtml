<p class="nonindent">When a patient has sustained enough kidney damage to require RRT on a permanent basis, the patient has moved into the fifth or final stage of CKD, also referred to as ESKD. In 2017, 86.9% of patients newly diagnosed with ESKD began RRT with HD, 10.1% started with PD, and 2.9% received a preemptive kidney transplant. A preemptive transplant is when a patient undergoes kidney transplantation from a living donor before dialysis is initiated. Of great concern is that 33% of patients diagnosed with ESKD had received little or no pre-ESKD nephrology care and 19.2% received no nephrology care prior to requiring RRT. As of December 31, 2017, 62.7% of all patients previously diagnosed with ESKD were receiving HD therapy, 7.1% were being treated with PD, and 29.9% had a functioning kidney transplant. Among patients being treated with HD, 98.0% used in-center HD (USRDS, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">In July 2019, the President, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an Executive Order, with the goal of improving the lives of Americans with ESKD by expanding treatment options and reducing health care costs. As part of this Executive Order, a mandatory payment model promotes moving patients from in-center to home dialysis (both PD and home HD) and increasing the number of patients receiving kidney transplants. There is much work and policy development that will need to be done to reach this goal by the projected date of 2025 (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3543">Kear, Bednarski, Smith, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2157">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As renal function declines, the end products of protein metabolism (normally excreted in urine) accumulate in the blood. Uremia develops and adversely affects every system in the body. The greater the buildup of waste products, the more pronounced the symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">The rate of decline in renal function and progression of ESKD is related to the underlying disorder, the urinary excretion of protein, and the presence of hypertension. The disease tends to progress more rapidly in patients who excrete significant amounts of protein or have elevated blood pressure than in those without these conditions (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2158">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because virtually every body system is affected in ESKD, patients exhibit a number of signs and symptoms. The severity of these signs and symptoms depends in part on the degree of renal impairment, other underlying conditions, and the patient&#x2019;s age. Cardiovascular disease is the predominant cause of death in patients with ESKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Subbiah et al., 2016</a>). Peripheral neuropathy, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, is present in some patients, especially those with diabetes. Patients complain of severe pain and discomfort. Restless leg syndrome and burning feet can occur in the early stage of uremic peripheral neuropathy. The precise mechanisms for many of these systemic signs and symptoms have not been identified. However, it is generally thought that the accumulation of uremic waste products is the probable cause. <a href="#ct48-6">Chart&#x00A0;48-6</a> summarizes the systemic signs and symptoms.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2159">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Glomerular Filtration Rate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As the GFR decreases (due to nonfunctioning glomeruli), the creatinine clearance decreases, whereas the serum creatinine and BUN levels increase. Serum creatinine is a more sensitive indicator of renal function than BUN. The BUN is affected not only by kidney disease but also by protein intake in the diet, catabolism (tissue and RBC breakdown), parenteral nutrition, and medications such as corticosteroids.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sodium and Water Retention</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The kidney cannot concentrate or dilute the urine normally in ESKD. Appropriate responses by the kidney to changes in the daily intake of water and electrolytes, therefore, do not occur. Some patients retain sodium and water, increasing the risk for edema, heart failure, and hypertension. Hypertension may also result from activation of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone axis and the concomitant increased aldosterone secretion. Other patients have a tendency to lose sodium and run the risk of developing hypotension and hypovolemia. Vomiting and diarrhea may cause water depletion, which may worsen the uremic state.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acidosis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Metabolic acidosis occurs in ESKD because the kidneys are unable to excrete increased loads of acid. Decreased acid secretion results from the inability of the kidney tubules to excrete ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and to reabsorb sodium bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>). There is also decreased excretion of phosphorus and other organic acids.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Anemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anemia develops as a result of inadequate erythropoietin production, the shortened lifespan of RBCs, nutritional deficiencies, and the patient&#x2019;s tendency to bleed, particularly from the GI tract. Erythropoietin, a substance normally produced by the kidneys, stimulates bone marrow to produce RBCs. In ESKD, erythropoietin production decreases and profound anemia results, producing fatigue, angina, and shortness of breath (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Evans, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Calcium and Phosphorus Imbalance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Another abnormality seen in ESKD is a disorder in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Serum calcium and phosphate levels have a reciprocal relationship in the body: As one increases, the other decreases. With a decrease in filtration through the glomerulus of the kidney, there is an increase in the serum phosphorus level and a reciprocal or corresponding decrease in the serum calcium level. The decreased serum calcium level causes increased secretion of parathormone from the parathyroid glands. However, in kidney disease, the body cannot respond normally to the increased secretion of parathormone. As a result, calcium leaves the bone, often producing bone changes and bone disease as well as calcification of major blood vessels in the body. In addition, the active <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1571" title="1571"></span>metabolite of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) normally manufactured by the kidney decreases as kidney disease progresses (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Brooks, 2017</a>). Uremic bone disease, often called renal osteodystrophy, develops from the complex changes in calcium, phosphate, and parathormone balance. There is also evidence of calcification of blood vessels.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2160">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are a number of potential complications of ESKD that necessitate a collaborative approach to care. These include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production, decreased RBC lifespan, bleeding in the GI tract from irritating toxins and ulcer formation, and blood loss in the dialysis circuit and dialyzer after HD has been completed</span></li>
<li><span>Bone disease and metastatic and vascular calcifications due to retention of phosphorus, low serum calcium levels, and abnormal vitamin D metabolism</span></li>
<li><span>Hyperkalemia due to decreased excretion, metabolic acidosis, catabolism, and excessive potassium intake from diet, medications, or IV solutions</span></li>
<li><span>Hypertension due to sodium and water retention and malfunction of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system</span></li>
<li><span>Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and pericardial tamponade due to retention of uremic waste products and inadequate dialysis</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2161">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of management is to maintain kidney function and homeostasis for as long as possible. All factors that contribute to ESKD and all factors that are reversible (e.g., obstruction) are identified and treated. Management is accomplished primarily with medications and diet therapy, although dialysis may also be needed to decrease the level of uremic waste products in the blood and to control electrolyte balance. The close collaboration of a renal dietitian is essential in dietary therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Complications can be prevented or delayed with the appropriate medication. Phosphate-binding agents, calcium and vitamin D supplements, antihypertensive and cardiac <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1572" title="1572"></span>medications, as well as recombinant human erythropoietin are frequently prescribed (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Parikh et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Calcium and Phosphorus Binders</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia are treated with medications that bind dietary phosphorus in the GI tract. Binders such as calcium carbonate or calcium acetate are prescribed, but there is a risk of hypercalcemia. If calcium is high or the calcium&#x2013;phosphorus product exceeds 55 mg/dL, a polymeric phosphate binder such as sevelamer carbonate may be prescribed (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>). This medication binds dietary phosphorus in the intestinal tract; one to four tablets are given with the first bite of food to be effective.</p>
<p class="h7">Antihypertensive and Cardiovascular Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is managed by intravascular volume control and a variety of antihypertensive agents (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>). Heart failure and pulmonary edema may also require treatment with fluid restriction, low-sodium diets, diuretic agents, inotropic agents, and dialysis. The metabolic acidosis of ESKD usually produces no symptoms and requires no treatment. However, sodium bicarbonate supplements or dialysis may be needed to correct the acidosis if it causes symptoms.</p>
<p class="h7">Erythropoietin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Anemia associated with ESKD is treated with erythrocyte-stimulating agents (recombinant human erythropoietin). Patients with anemia present with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise, general fatigability, and decreased activity tolerance. Erythrocyte stimulation therapy is initiated to achieve a target hemoglobin of 10 to 11 g/dL, which generally alleviates many of the symptoms of anemia without causing an increased risk of death and cardiovascular complications (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Evans, 2017</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Recombinant human erythropoietin may be administered IV or subcutaneously once or three times a week in ESKD. It will take 2 to 6 weeks for the hemoglobin to increase. Therefore, the medication is not indicated for patients who need immediate correction of severe anemia. Adverse effects seen with erythropoietin therapy include hypertension (especially during early stages of treatment), increased clotting of vascular access sites, seizures, cardiovascular events, and depletion of body iron stores (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Evans, 2017</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Management involves adjustment of heparin to prevent clotting of the lines during HD treatments and monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit, serum iron and transferrin levels. Prior to beginning therapy, iron studies are indicated and if iron deficiency is noted, a course of IV iron is prescribed since adequate stores of iron are needed for an adequate response. In addition, vitamin deficiencies are ruled out including folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Common iron supplements include iron sucrose and ferric gluconate (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Evans, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure and serum potassium level are monitored to detect hypertension and increasing serum potassium levels, which may occur with therapy and the increasing RBC mass. Recombinant erythropoietin therapy should be used cautiously in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>). The occurrence of hypertension requires initiation or adjustment of the patient&#x2019;s antihypertensive therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have received erythropoietin therapy have reported decreased levels of fatigue, increased feelings of well-being, better tolerance of dialysis, higher-energy levels, and improved exercise tolerance (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Evans, 2017</a>). In addition, this therapy has decreased the need for transfusion and its associated risks, including bloodborne infectious disease, antibody formation, and iron overload (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Evans, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A referral to a renal dietitian is essential. Dietary intervention is necessary with deterioration of renal function and includes careful regulation of protein intake, fluid intake to balance fluid losses, and restriction of potassium and sodium. At the same time, adequate caloric intake and vitamin supplementation must be ensured. Patients on dialysis need a higher intake of protein than healthy adults and current protein recommendations for stable patients on HD is 1.2 g/kg/day and PD is 1.2 to 1.3 g/kg/day (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3552">National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [NKF KDOQI], 2000</a>). The allowed protein must be of high-biologic value (eggs, meats, fish). High&#x2013;biologic-value proteins are those that are complete proteins and supply the essential amino acids necessary for growth and cell repair.</p>
<p class="indent">Usually, the fluid allowance per day for patients who receive in-center HD who are anuric is about 1000 mL daily. For those who produce urine, recommendations are individualized based on the patient&#x2019;s 24-hour urinary volume. This is done in order to limit interdialytic weight gains to less than 4% of estimated dry weight (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Gonyea, 2017</a>). Adequate calories are supplied by carbohydrates, protein, and fat to prevent wasting. In addition, the patient on dialysis loses water-soluble vitamins during the dialysis treatment, so an oral vitamin B and C supplement is prescribed to be taken after dialysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Hyperkalemia is usually prevented by ensuring adequate dialysis treatments with potassium removal and careful restriction of diet, medications, and fluids for their potassium content.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dialysis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with increasing symptoms of kidney disease is referred to a dialysis and transplantation center early in the course of progressive kidney disease. Dialysis is usually initiated when the patient cannot maintain a reasonable quality of life with conservative treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2162">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with ESKD requires astute nursing care to avoid the complications of reduced renal function and the stresses and anxieties of dealing with a life-threatening illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care is directed toward assessing fluid status and identifying potential sources of imbalance, working with a renal dietitian to implement a dietary program to ensure proper nutritional intake within the limits of the treatment regimen, and engaging the patient by encouraging increased self-care and greater independence. It is extremely important to provide explanations and information to the patient and family concerning ESKD, treatment options, and potential complications. A great deal of emotional support is needed by the patient and family because of the numerous changes experienced. A social worker is also a vital part of the interprofessional care at the dialysis center. Specific interventions, along with rationale and evaluation criteria, are presented in more detail in the plan of nursing care for the patient with ESKD (see <a href="#ct48-7">Chart&#x00A0;48-7</a>).</p>

<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse plays an important role in educating the patient with ESKD. Because of the extensive education needed, the home health nurse, dialysis nurse, and nurses in the hospital and outpatient settings, as well as a renal dietitian, all provide ongoing education and reinforcement while monitoring the patient&#x2019;s progress and adherence to the treatment regimen. The patient is instructed to check the vascular access for patency and to use appropriate precautions, such as avoiding venipuncture and blood pressure measurements on the arm with the access device. In addition, the patient and family need to know what problems to report to the primary provider. These include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Worsening signs and symptoms of kidney disease (nausea, vomiting, change in usual urine output, metallic taste in the mouth, ammonia odor on breath)</span></li>
<li><span>Signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia (muscle weakness, diarrhea, abdominal cramps)</span></li>
<li><span>Signs and symptoms of access problems (clotted fistula or graft, infection)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms of decreasing renal function, in addition to increasing BUN and serum creatinine levels, may indicate a need to alter the dialysis prescription. The dialysis nurses also provide ongoing education and support at each treatment visit.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1576</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1577" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1577">p. 1577</span></div>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The importance of follow-up examinations and treatment is stressed with the patient and family because of changing physical status, renal function, and dialysis requirements. Referral for home care provides the home health nurse with the opportunity to assess the patient&#x2019;s environment, emotional status, and the coping strategies used by the patient and family to deal with the changes in family roles often associated with chronic illness.</p>
<p class="indent">The home health nurse also assesses the patient for further deterioration of renal function and signs and symptoms of complications resulting from the primary kidney disorder, the resulting kidney disease, and effects of treatment strategies (e.g., dialysis, medications, dietary restrictions). Patients need education and reinforcement of the dietary restrictions required, including fluid, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus restriction. Reminders about the need for health promotion activities and health screening are an important part of nursing care for the patient with kidney disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2163"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetes, hypertension, chronic glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and urinary tract obstruction are among the causes for ESKD in older adults. The fastest growing group of patients with CKD is older adults who also have more comorbidities (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Brooks, 2017</a>). The signs and symptoms of kidney disease in older adults are often nonspecific. The occurrence of symptoms of other disorders (heart failure, dementia) can mask the symptoms of kidney disease and delay or prevent diagnosis and treatment (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hain, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">HD and PD are used effectively in treating older patients with ESKD. Initiation of dialysis among older adults has increased in the past decade as baby boomers have come of age. Implementation of palliative care has also increased among patients who choose not to start dialysis or who decide to stop dialysis. Although there is no specific age limitation for kidney transplantation, concomitant disorders (e.g., coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease) have made it a less common treatment for older adults. However, in the United States, when adults age 60 and older who have significant comorbidities are ruled out (i.e., not considered to be suitable) as transplant candidates, those who do receive a kidney transplant survive longer than patients on dialysis and those who remain on the transplant waiting list (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Bunnapradist, Abdalla, &#x0026; Reddy, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some older patients elect not to undergo dialysis or transplantation. Conservative management and palliative care, also known as supportive care, including nutritional therapy, fluid control, and medications such as phosphate binders, may be considered in patients who are not suitable for or elect not to have dialysis or transplantation (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Molzahn &#x0026; Schick-Makaroff, 2017</a>). Palliative care for the patient with ESKD focuses on relieving suffering, promoting health-related quality of life, and facilitating dignity at the end-of-life (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
