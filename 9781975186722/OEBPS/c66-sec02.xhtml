<h4 class="h4" id="s3130">Infection Control and Prevention</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are the principal agencies involved in setting guidelines about infection prevention. The impact of infectious diseases changes over time as microorganisms mutate, as human behavior patterns shift, or as therapeutic options change. The CDC provides timely recommendations about many of the situations that a nurse may face when caring for or educating a patient with an infectious disease and routinely publishes recommendations, guidelines, and summaries. Through its Internet site and its weekly journal, the <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR),</em> the CDC reports significant cases, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;outbreak:&lt;/b&gt; the occurrence of a disease within a population that exceeds normal expectations">outbreak</button></strong>s (the occurrence of a disease within a population that exceeds normal expectations), environmental hazards, or other public health problems. Examples of important CDC guidelines and summaries include <em>Immunization Schedule</em>s (CDC, 2020b) and <em>Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel During the COVID-19 Pandemic</em> (CDC, 2020c).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses serve important roles in preventing the transfer of organisms given their frequent encounters with patients and families. It is essential for the nurse to model appropriate and effective hand hygiene practices in all aspects of patient care. Nurses can also help reduce hand-to-hand spread of organisms by serving as patient advocates. The nurse should observe the hand hygiene activities of other professionals and alert them to lapses in technique that are observed. Nurses need to educate patients and their families to feel comfortable in reminding health care workers to perform hand hygiene before patient contact.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter summarizes several aspects of infectious diseases. However, the field of infection control and prevention changes rapidly. The COVID-19 <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pandemic:&lt;/b&gt; an epidemic that spreads across multiple countries or continents">pandemic</button></strong> provides a striking example of how a new infectious agent can place new expectations and responsibilities on health care workers, including nurses. A pandemic is an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;epidemic:&lt;/b&gt; a widespread outbreak of a specific infectious disease from a single source within a community or population that exceeds anticipated levels of impact">epidemic</button></strong> (an outbreak of infectious disease within a population that exceeds anticipated levels of impact) that spreads across multiple countries or continents. The COVID-19 crisis created unprecedented challenges with health care systems modifying everyday practices, and making administrative system wide changes. Nurses carried out complex care, simultaneously adapting to frequent changes in protocols, therapies, and other day-to-day routines, while also providing direction and support for stressed patients and family members. See <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a> for discussion of moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3131">Preventing Infection in Health Care Settings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The prevention of infection in the health care setting focuses upon following the appropriate standard and transmission-based precautions as well as reducing the risk of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2150" title="2150"></span><strong>health care&#x2013;associated infection (HAI)</strong>. HAIs, formerly called <em>nosocomial infections,</em> are infections that were not present or incubating at the time of the patient&#x2019;s admission to the health care setting<em>.</em></p>
<p class="indent">There are many types of HAIs. The most widely used system for tracking HAIs is the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) (CDC, 2020d). The system can be used by individual facilities to analyze risk-adjusted outcomes. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses this standardized source to post outcomes on their Web site, Hospital Compare, so that the public can view the data (see Resources section). CMS also uses these data for imposing financial penalties for facilities who have less favorable HAI rates.</p>
<p class="indent">The NHSN has reporting systems for several health care facility types. These include acute care facilities, ambulatory care centers, long-term care facilities, outpatient dialysis centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, inpatient psychiatric facilities, and home dialysis facilities (CDC, 2020d).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Isolation Precautions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Isolation precautions are guidelines created to prevent transmission of microorganisms in health care facilities. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) of the CDC recommends two tiers of isolation precautions. The first tier, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;standard precautions:&lt;/b&gt; strategy of assuming all patients may carry infectious agents and using appropriate barrier precautions for all health care worker&#x2013;patient interactions">standard precautions</button></strong>, is designed for the care of <em>all</em> patients and is the primary strategy for preventing HAIs. The second tier, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;transmission-based precautions:&lt;/b&gt; precautions used in addition to standard precautions when contagious or epidemiologically significant organisms are recognized; the three types of transmission-based precautions are airborne, droplet, and contact precautions">transmission-based precautions</button></strong>, is designed for care of patients with known or suspected infectious diseases spread by airborne, droplet, or contact routes. In addition, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations are followed to prevent exposure to bloodborne pathogens and hazardous substances (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4600">Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], 2012</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Standard Precautions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The basis of standard precautions is that all patients are colonized or infected with microorganisms, whether or not there are signs or symptoms, and that a uniform level of caution should be used in the care of all patients. The health care worker should use additional barriers in the form of personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, masks, eye protection, and cover gowns, depending on the expected degree of exposure to patient excretions or secretions. The elements of standard precautions include appropriate hand hygiene, the use of PPE, proper handling of patient care equipment and linen, environmental control, prevention of injury from sharps devices, and patient room assignments within health care facilities. Hand hygiene, glove use, needlestick prevention, and avoidance of splash or spray of body fluids are discussed in the following sections. See <a href="c32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a>, <a href="c32-sec01.xhtml#ct32-5">Chart&#x00A0;32-5</a> for a description of standard precautions.</p>
<p class="h8">Hand Hygiene</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most frequent cause of bacterial transmission in health care institutions is spread of microorganisms by the hands of health care workers. Health care workers should perform hand hygiene frequently during patient care. <a href="#ct66-1">Chart&#x00A0;66-1</a> describes the indications for different hand hygiene methods (CDC, 2002).</p>

<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (2002). Guideline for hand hygiene in health care settings. <em>MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 51</em>(RR 16), 1&#x2013;56.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with biologic material from patient care, the worker should wash hands with soap and water. In intensive care units and other locations in which virulent or resistant organisms are likely to be present, antimicrobial agents (e.g., chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophor, chloroxylenol) may be used. Effective handwashing requires at least <em>20 seconds of vigorous scrubbing,</em> with special attention to the area around nail beds and between fingers, where there is a high bacterial load. Hands should be thoroughly rinsed after washing (CDC, 2002).</p>
<p class="indent">If hands are not visibly soiled, health care providers are encouraged to use alcohol-based, waterless antiseptic agents for routine hand decontamination. These solutions are superior to soap or antimicrobial handwashing agents in their speed of action and effectiveness against most microorganisms. Because they are formulated with emollients, they are usually better tolerated than other agents, and because they can be used without sinks and towels, health care workers may be more adherent with their use. Nurses working in home health care or other settings where they are relatively mobile should carry pocket-sized containers of alcohol-based solutions. The spore form of the bacterium <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> is resistant to alcohol and other hand disinfectants; therefore, the use of gloves and handwashing (soap and water for physical removal) are required when <em>C. difficile</em> has been identified (CDC, 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Normal skin flora usually include relatively benign coagulase-negative staphylococci or diphtheroids. Health care workers may temporarily carry more potentially pathogenic bacteria such as <em>S. aureus</em> or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. This temporary carriage is considered <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;transient flora:&lt;/b&gt; organisms that have been recently acquired and are likely to be shed in a relatively short period">transient flora</button></strong> which will likely be shed with hand hygiene and natural skin degeneration over time.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2150</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2151" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2151">p. 2151</span></div>
<p class="indent">Hand hygiene decreases bacterial transmission to patients by reducing bacterial load on health care workers&#x2019; hands. The Joint Commission includes hand hygiene as one of the National Patient Safety Goals and focuses on this behavior in surveys of health care facilities (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4605">The Joint Commission, 2021</a>). All health care settings should have mechanisms to measure and improve adherence with hand hygiene by all personnel who care for patients (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Schierhorn, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Artificial fingernails or nail extenders have been epidemiologically linked to several significant infection outbreaks and therefore should not be worn when providing patient care. Natural nails should be kept less than 0.6 cm (0.25 inch) long, and nail polish should be removed when chipped because it can support increased bacterial growth (CDC, 2002).</p>
<p class="h8">Glove Use</p>
<p class="nonindent">Gloves provide an effective barrier for hands from the microflora associated with patient care. Gloves should be worn when a health care worker has contact with any patient secretions or excretions and must be discarded after each patient care contact. Because microbial organisms colonizing health care workers&#x2019; hands can proliferate in the warm, moist environment provided by gloves, hands must be washed or disinfected after gloves are removed. As patient advocates, nurses have an important role in promoting hand hygiene and glove use by other hospital workers, such as laboratory personnel, technicians, physicians, and others who have contact with patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Compared with vinyl gloves, latex or nitrile gloves are preferred because they resist puncture better and provide greater comfort and fit. Improvements in latex gloves have reduced the incidence of latex hypersensitivity, but some workers continue to experience local skin irritation or more severe reactions, including generalized dermatitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, angioedema, and anaphylaxis (see <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>). The nurse who experiences irritation or an allergic reaction associated with exposure to latex should report symptoms to an occupational health specialist or a primary provider and avoid latex-based products.</p>
<p class="h8">Needlestick Prevention</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most important aspect of reducing the risk of bloodborne infection is avoidance of percutaneous injury. Extreme care is essential in all situations in which needles, scalpels, and other sharp objects are handled. Used needles should not be recapped. Instead, they are placed directly into puncture-resistant containers close to where they are used. If a situation dictates that a needle must be recapped, the nurse must use a mechanical device to hold the cap or use a one-handed approach to decrease the likelihood of skin puncture. OSHA requires use of needleless devices and other instruments designed to prevent injury from sharps when appropriate (OSHA, 2012).</p>
<p class="h8">Avoidance of Splash and Spray</p>
<p class="nonindent">When the health care professional is involved in an activity in which body fluids may be sprayed or splashed, appropriate barriers must be used. If a splash to the face may occur, goggles and a facemask are warranted. If the health care worker is involved in a procedure in which clothing may be contaminated with biologic material, a cover gown should be worn (CDC, 2007).</p>
<p class="h7">Transmission-Based Precautions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Reducing the risk of HAIs requires specific preventive activities in addition to implementing standard precautions. Some microbes are so contagious or epidemiologically important that, in addition to standard precautions, a second tier of precautions&#x2014;transmission-based precautions&#x2014;should be used when such organisms have been identified. Transmission-based categories are airborne, droplet, and contact precautions (CDC, 2007). As the term implies, the precautions are based on the routes of transmission. Diseases spread by very small respiratory particles that are suspended as aerosol require airborne precautions, those spread by larger respiratory droplets require droplet precautions, and those spread by touch require contact precautions.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Airborne precautions</em> are required for patients with presumed or proven pulmonary TB, varicella, or other airborne pathogens such as COVID-19. When hospitalized, patients should be in airborne infection isolation rooms, engineered to provide negative air pressure, rapid turnover of air, and air either highly filtered or exhausted directly to the outside. If a facility does not have negative pressure rooms available, portable high-efficiency particular air (HEPA) filters may be used. Health care providers should wear an N95 respirator (i.e., protective mask) (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>, <a href="c68-sec04.xhtml#ff68-1">Fig.&#x00A0;68-1</a>) at all times while in the patient&#x2019;s room. The nurse should be able to validate room negative pressure by reading a pressure manometer placed outside the room or by witnessing that a tissue held at the gap between the door and the floor will be pulled toward the room.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Droplet precautions</em> are used for organisms such as influenza or meningococcus that can be transmitted by close contact with respiratory or pharyngeal secretions. When caring for a patient requiring droplet precautions, the nurse should wear a facemask within 3 to 6 feet of the patient; however, because the risk of transmission is limited to close contact, the door may remain open.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Contact precautions</em> are used for organisms that are spread by skin-to-skin contact, such as antibiotic-resistant organisms or <em>C. difficile.</em> Contact precautions are designed to emphasize cautious technique and the use of barriers. When possible, the patient requiring contact isolation is placed in a private room to facilitate hand hygiene and decreased environmental contamination. Masks are not needed, and doors do not need to be closed (see <a href="#ct66-2">Chart&#x00A0;66-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="AW2-5" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt="img"/> COVID-19 Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Guidelines for preventing transmission of COVID-19 in health care facilities include using a combination of all the transmission-based precautions and adding other prevention elements, such as increased use of PPE, enhanced cleaning, and adjusted visitor policies (CDC, 2020c). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted by close contact to droplets and aerosol and by touching contaminated surfaces, with subsequent self-infection when touching the face. In most social interactions, the virus appears to be spread from droplets from the infected person to another. In the health care setting, airborne transmission can occur when aerosol-generating procedures are conducted. Procedures such as intubation, extubation, suctioning, and administering nebulized medication can mechanically aerosolize droplets so that infective particles can be inhaled. Similar transmission may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2152" title="2152"></span>be possible with other close contact, such as may be required in the care of a patient infected with COVID-19. Due to COVID-19&#x2019;s <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;virulence:&lt;/b&gt; degree of pathogenicity of an organism">virulence</button></strong> (degree of pathogenicity of an organism), contagiousness, and lack of treatment, guidelines advise facilities to use a combination of droplet, airborne, and contact precautions (CDC, 2020c). See discussion later in this chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">To protect against potential airborne transmission, health care workers in close contact with patients infected with COVID-19 were advised to use N95 respirators or powered air-purified respirators (PAPRs) (CDC, 2020c). When there is not an adequate supply of such devices to use for all patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, a system should be designed to prioritize their use for aerosol-generating procedures. Some health care facilities have been able to reprocess N95s to expand their availability (CDC, 2020e). See <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a> for recommendations for preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4552">American Academy of Dermatology [AAD], 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Gowns and gloves are worn to prevent transmission by contact. Health care workers must carefully put on, use, and safely take off PPE. Using the correct sequence for putting on and taking off PPE is especially important with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other highly contagious or virulent pathogens. The recommended sequence for putting on and safely removing PPE is outlined in <a href="#ct66-3">Chart&#x00A0;66-3</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Specific Organisms with HAI Potential</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the WHO and CDC had focused increased attention on HAIs, which have also received increased focus from The Joint Commission, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and Medicare. HAI rates for each hospital are posted on the Hospital Compare Web site (see the Resources section). The Hospital Compare site also reports on some infections where the actual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2153" title="2153"></span>acquisition location is difficult to determine. For example, Hospital Compare shows rates for <em>C. difficile</em>, considering any case first diagnosed after the third day of hospitalization as a hospital onset case.</p>

<p class="h7">Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms</p>
<p class="nonindent">Extensive use of antibiotic agents in agriculture and health care has led to a growing prevalence of organisms with fewer effective antibiotics. Approximately 3 million people develop antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States each year, and approximately 35,000 die from these infections (CDC, 2019a). Bacteria that most commonly develop resistance include <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, carbapenems), <em>Acinetobacter</em> species (resistant to many antibiotics, including carbapenems), and both <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and <em>Escherichia coli</em> (resistant to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics).</p>
<p class="indent">Concerns about antibiotic-resistant organisms and the loss of effective antibiotic therapy for serious infections have grown. The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals include requirements to have a program to analyze and reduce antibiotic resistant-infections (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4605">The Joint Commission, 2021</a>). The CDC provides explanations about the causes of multiple drug resistant organisms, current efforts to control them, estimates of incidence, and mortality rates for significant pathogens (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="h8"><em>Clostridioides</em> difficile</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>C. difficile</em> is a spore-forming bacterium that has significant HAI potential. An especially virulent strain has affected health care facilities throughout North America in the past several years. After marked increases in the first decade after 2000, a 29% decrease in the rate of hospital-onset <em>C. difficile</em> infection from 2015 to 2018 was recorded (CDC, 2019b). While the exact reason for the decrease is not clear, some believe it is due to increased focus on antimicrobial stewardship, a program to assure the right antibiotic for the right patient at the right time (CDC, 2019b). Despite this drop in rates of infection, <em>C. difficile</em> is considered the most common cause of HAI in U.S. hospitals (CDC, 2019b). Infection is usually preceded by antibiotic agents that disrupt normal intestinal flora and allow the antibiotic-resistant <em>C. difficile</em> spores to proliferate within the intestine. The organism causes pathology by releasing toxins into the lumen of the bowel. In pseudomembranous colitis (the most extreme form of <em>C. difficile</em> infection), debris from the injured lumen of the bowel and from white blood cells accumulates in the form of pseudomembranes or studded areas of the colon. The destruction of such a large anatomic area can cause sepsis.</p>
<p class="indent">Because antibiotics are used so extensively in health care settings, many patients are at risk for infection with <em>C. difficile.</em> The potential for health care&#x2013;associated acquisition is increased because the spore is relatively resistant to disinfectants and can be spread on the hands of health care providers after contact with equipment previously contaminated with <em>C. difficile.</em> Control is best achieved by using contact precautions for patients who are infected, with use of gowns and gloves for all patient contact. Because the spores are resistant to alcohol, waterless hand products are not as effective as handwashing with soap and water for use in hand hygiene. Bleach-based cleaning products are optimal because bleach can kill spores, whereas other cleaning agents often do not. Frequently touched equipment, such as overbed tables and side rails, should be cleaned daily and whenever visibly soiled. IV poles and other peripheral items should be cleaned when the patient is discharged (CDC, 2019c).</p>
<p class="h8">Methicillin-Resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus</em> <em>aureus</em> (MRSA)</strong>, a common human pathogen, refers to <em>S. aureus</em> that is resistant to methicillin or its comparable pharmaceutical agents, oxacillin and nafcillin. Soon after penicillin was discovered in the 1940s, <em>S. aureus</em> became all but universally penicillin resistant. Alternative therapies in the form of cephalosporins and synthetic penicillin solutions such as methicillin were introduced. During the late 1970s, MRSA became increasingly more prevalent, as transmission within hospitals and nursing homes was well documented.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="AH6"><strong>Health Care&#x2013;Associated MRSA.</strong></span> Health care providers transmit MRSA to patients easily because <em>S. aureus</em> has an affinity for skin colonization. The patient who is colonized with MRSA has an increased probability of developing an infection with MRSA, especially when invasive procedures (e.g., IV therapy, respiratory therapy, surgery) are performed. Such infections are characterized as healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (HA-MRSA). HA-MRSA may persist as normal flora in the patient for an extended time. The patient who is colonized also serves as a reservoir for MRSA transmission to others. In recent years, the incidence of invasive HA-MRSA has decreased (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4595">Kourtis, Hatfield, Baggs, et al., 2019</a>). Although the exact reasons for the decline are unknown, it is likely that infection control efforts (especially those focused on reduction of bloodstream infections) and declining lengths of hospital stay (therefore decreasing exposure within health care agencies) are important factors.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="AH6"><strong>Community-Associated MRSA.</strong></span> New strains of MRSA have caused infections and outbreaks in children, members of sports teams, and prison inmates, and in other people who had no apparent health care exposure. These community-associated methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) infections are typically caused by strains of <em>S. aureus</em> that are molecularly distinct from HA-MRSA. The CA-MRSA strains typically produce more toxins than HA-MRSA and localized skin and soft tissue infections, and can lead to necrotizing fasciitis or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bacteremia:&lt;/b&gt; laboratory-confirmed presence of bacteria in the bloodstream">bacteremia</button></strong> (laboratory-confirmed presence of bacteria in the bloodstream). Often, skin symptoms are initially mistaken for insect or spider bites (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Kourtis et al., 2019</a>). CA-MRSA infections have resulted in serious skin and soft tissue infections; pneumonia; and, in rare cases, death.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="AH6"><strong>Control of MRSA in Health Care Facilities.</strong></span> Nurses must be prepared to educate patients and their families about the definitions of colonization and infection. The CDC recommends contact precautions for patients with MRSA colonization or infection (CDC, 2007). That guidance has become increasingly controversial as some research has reported that contact precautions may not decrease the acquisition of new infections (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4602">Renaudin, Llorens, Goetz, et al., 2017</a>). In facilities that use contact precautions for MRSA, nurses must explain the reason for isolation to patients and their families.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2154</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2155" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2155">p. 2155</span></div>
<p class="indent">Vancomycin and linezolid are typically the preferred treatment options for serious MRSA infection. However, there is concern that MRSA will eventually become resistant to even these medications because they are used so frequently.</p>
<p class="h8">Multidrug Resistant Enterobacteriaceae</p>
<p class="nonindent">A group of gram-negative organisms called Enterobacteriaceae, organisms associated with gastrointestinal colonization, are becoming resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics. Clinically important Enterobacteriaceae include <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella</em> species, among others. Some produce enzymes known as extended spectrum beta-lactamases that disrupt the efficacy of some common antibiotics including penicillins and cephalosporins (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Extended spectrum beta-lactamases infections increased by approximately 50% between 2012 and 2017 and were identified in the community and all health care settings (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Carbapenem antibiotics can be used for extended spectrum beta-lactamases infections. However, some of these bacteria have also developed resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. These carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) organisms are very difficult to treat. Among patients who are hospitalized and infected with CRE organisms, the mortality rate is approximately 50% (CDC, 2020f).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with extended spectrum beta-lactam resistance or carbapenem resistance should be isolated, using contact precautions. If multiple patients with CRE on one unit within a facility are identified, or if there is other evidence of transmission, additional prevention steps should be implemented. These steps include dedicating personnel to solely care for these groups of patients, conducting cultures of other patients in the unit or service, and enhanced investigation of new cases (CDC, 2020f).</p>
<p class="h8">Candida Auris</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Candida auris</em> is a multi-drug resistant fungus, a yeast species that is difficult to identify in the laboratory, and difficult to remove with hospital disinfectants. It has caused outbreaks in acute care and long-term care settings. Between 2017 and 2018, reported cases increased by over 300% (CDC, 2019c). Although a patient can have an asymptomatic colonization, it can also cause bloodstream and other serious infections, with mortality rates approaching 30% (CDC, 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with <em>C. auris</em> colonization or infection should be placed in contact precautions and should be reported to local health departments. When multiple patients are diagnosed with <em>C. auris</em>, an investigation should include culturing to detect other patients in the unit or area close to the patient with confirmed <em>C. auris</em> who also may be colonized (CDC, 2019c).</p>
<p class="h8">Vancomycin-Resistant <em>Enterococcus</em></p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> (VRE)</strong> refers to <em>Enterococcus</em> bacterium that is resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin; it is the second most frequently isolated source of HAIs in the United States. This gram-positive bacterium can produce significant disease when it infects blood, wounds, or the urinary tract (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Enterococcus</em> has several traits that make it an easily transmittable HAI organism. It is a part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract; it is bile resistant and able to withstand harsh anatomic sites, such as the intestine; and it persists well on the hands of health care providers and on environmental objects.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Enterococcus</em> is a relatively antimicrobial-resistant organism at baseline; thus, therapy is limited to penicillin formulations (e.g., ampicillin), vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin), or linezolid. VRE colonization and infection may serve as a reservoir of vancomycin-resistant coded genes that may be transferred to the more virulent <em>S. aureus.</em> The two most frequently cultured enterococcal species are <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> (approximately 7% resistant) and <em>Enterococcus faecium</em> (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Health Care&#x2013;Associated Bloodstream Infections</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Any vascular catheter can serve as the source for a bloodstream infection. Central lines (vascular catheters where the tip ends in or near the heart) are more likely to be associated with bloodstream infection. Central line&#x2013;associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) add an estimated average cost of $50,000 per hospital stay and increase the risk of mortality by an estimated threefold (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4551">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2017</a>). Increasingly, long-term central catheters are used to provide IV therapy to patients who are hospitalized as well as to patients in long-term care facilities, patients in clinics, and patients receiving home health care. In all instances, the nurse must use appropriate care to reduce the risk of bacteremia and to be alert to signs of its presence.</p>
<p class="indent">The recommended bundle approach for preventing CLABSIs includes hand hygiene; maximal barrier precautions; chlorhexidine skin antisepsis; optimal catheter site selection, with avoidance of the femoral vein for central venous access in adult patients; and daily review of line necessity with prompt removal of unnecessary lines (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="c11-sec03.xhtml#ct11-2">Chart&#x00A0;11-2</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3132">Preventing Infection in the Community</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The CDC as well as state and local public health departments share responsibility for prevention and control of infection in the community. Methods of infection prevention include sanitation techniques (e.g., water purification, disposal of sewage and other potentially infectious materials), regulated health practices (e.g., the handling, storage, packaging, and preparation of food by institutions), and immunization programs.</p>
<p class="indent">Most infections occur in the community, out of health care settings. Nurses working in schools or public health facilities educate patients and the public to reduce the incidence of influenza, foodborne infections, and other infections. Local epidemics and pandemics are the most significant type of community-acquired infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Pandemics are usually caused by novel viruses which begin to circulate among a population that universally has no immunity. The epidemiologic definition of a pandemic, based on the degree of spread, has often been used socially to instead convey disaster. In recent centuries, significant pandemics have included the 1918 influenza pandemic, the pandemic in the 1980s and 1990s caused by the then-novel human immune deficiency virus (HIV), the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and most recently the 2019&#x2013;2021 COVID-19 pandemic (see the discussion of COVID-19 later in this chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">Novel virus based pandemics can be catastrophic compared with other anticipated public health problems because they last longer than other emergency events, often occur in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2156" title="2156"></span>&#x201C;waves,&#x201D; have the potential to deplete the available health care workforce, and reduce the supply of medical equipment because of their widespread nature. The frequency and severity of pandemics cannot be accurately predicted, but models suggest that even a medium-intensity pandemic can quickly overwhelm the existing health care infrastructure (CDC, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">The COVID-19 pandemic has changed many previous infection prevention practices as well as the way health care is delivered. Some clinicians have proposed that just as the crisis caused by the HIV pandemic led to sweeping changes in the delivery of health care that included the use of Standard Precautions, the COVID-19 crisis may lead to the use of Universal Pandemic Precautions (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4609">Weber, Babcock, Hayden, et al., 2020</a>). These new precautions would have individual implications, as all health care workers would universally use masks and eye protection during patient care (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Weber et al., 2020</a>). Health care facilities would increase the screening and isolation for patients with symptoms of possible viral disease (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Weber et al., 2020</a>). Such an approach would likely protect workers from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in anticipated future waves and would protect from other pathogens spread through a contact and droplet route.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses play a crucial role during a pandemic as they provide care while themselves becoming potentially exposed. During these times, nurses demonstrate the importance of following standard precautions and transmission-based precautions. With COVID-19 and other pandemics, critically important PPE supplies as well as lifesaving equipment and drugs can become scarce. As the extreme burden on nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 quickly became evident, formalized recommendations to improve nurse education, to add occupational prevention measures, and to include a nursing perspective in national planning were drafted (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4608">Veenema, Meyer, Bell, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vaccination Programs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of vaccination programs is to use wide-scale efforts to prevent specific infectious diseases from occurring in a population. Public health decisions about vaccination efforts are complex. Risks and benefits for the person and the community must be evaluated in terms of morbidity, mortality, and financial cost and benefit. Successful vaccine programs have reduced the incidence of many infectious diseases in the United States. (See later section COVID-19 Vaccines for further details of that program.)</p>
<p class="indent">Vaccines are suspensions of antigen preparations that are intended to produce a human immune response to protect the host from future encounters with the organism. Because no vaccine is completely safe for all recipients, contraindications on package inserts of a vaccine and CDC &#x201C;Vaccine Information Statements&#x201D; must be heeded. These documents provide details about studied experiences with allergy and other complications and provide crucial information about refrigeration, storage, dosage, and administration.</p>
<p class="indent">The recommended immunization schedules are revised by the CDC as epidemiologic evidence warrants. The two principal schedules are for children and adults (CDC, 2020b). Variations to the recommended immunization schedule should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient&#x2019;s risk factors as well as likely exposures. An annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all people 6 months or older, unless contraindicated. Health care workers should be immune to measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, and varicella.</p>
<p class="indent">The CDC provides information about individual vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases (see the Resources section). Advice about optimal vaccinations for travelers is available at the CDC and WHO Web sites as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, and diphtheria, is affected by immigration from developing countries. Vaccine campaigns in developing countries are often financially and logistically constrained, and immigrants from such areas may be more likely than U.S. residents to be unprotected. Individual and epidemic risks are reduced when vaccination campaigns reach all communities.</p>
<p class="h7">Reporting Problems with Vaccines</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses should ask adult vaccine recipients to provide information about any problems encountered after vaccination. If a patient reports problems after receiving a vaccination, a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form must be completed with the following information: type of vaccine received, timing of vaccination, onset of the adverse event, current illnesses or medication, history of adverse events after vaccination, and demographic information about the recipient. Forms can be submitted online (see the Resources section).</p>
<p class="h7">Contraindications to Vaccines</p>
<p class="nonindent">As a general rule, multiple vaccines may be given at the same visit and separating the dosing by time is not indicated. If they must be given on separate visits, it is then wise to separate by at least 4 weeks so that there is no immune reaction interfering with the response to the second vaccine (CDC, 2020b). Patients who have developed anaphylaxis or other moderate or severe sequelae after a previous dose should not receive further doses. Some live vaccines (e.g., varicella, MMR [against measles, mumps, and rubella], yellow fever) are contraindicated for people who are severely immunosuppressed or pregnant. All decisions about vaccination should be made by the patient&#x2019;s primary provider after careful review of vaccine-specific contraindications.</p>
<p class="h7">Common Vaccines</p>
<p class="h8">Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Since the time of licensing of the MMR vaccines, endemic rubeola (measles) has been eliminated in the United States, and mumps and rubella have decreased substantially. To maintain this effective public health strategy, routine MMR vaccination should be given to children at 12 to 15 months of age, with repeat dosing at 4 to 6 years of age. Adults who have not received the MMR vaccine should receive one to two doses (CDC, 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients should be advised that fever, transient lymphadenopathy, or hypersensitivity reaction might occur following an MMR vaccination. The risk of side effects is greater in vaccine recipients who have not previously received the vaccine than in those who have received repeat doses. Antipyretic agents may be used to decrease the risk of fever.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2156</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2157" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2157">p. 2157</span></div>
<p class="h8"><strong>Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine and Zoster (Shingles) Vaccine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and herpes zoster. In its natural state, VZV often attacks children, causing disseminated disease in the form of chickenpox. The severity of chickenpox may be increased among adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and those who are immune compromised (CDC, 2020b). Transmission occurs by the airborne and contact routes. With rare exception, varicella infects a person only once. The incubation period is about 2 weeks (range, 10 to 21 days). During a prodrome of general malaise (often noticed about 2 days before the rash develops), the newly infected host is capable of transmitting the virus to other susceptible contacts. Typically, the vesicular, pustular rash spreads rapidly from few to many lesions in a matter of hours. New lesions continue to form for 2 to 3 days and appear at different stages throughout this time. By the fourth symptomatic day, the lesions begin to dry, and new lesions usually do not develop. Fever is common during the 4 to 6 days of rash progression. When the lesions have crusted, the patient is no longer contagious.</p>
<p class="indent">The varicella vaccine is effective in preventing chickenpox in approximately 70% to 90% of people who receive two doses of vaccine. The vaccine is also available as part of MMRV, a formulation providing a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. The vaccine should not be given to those who have severely depressed immune function, are pregnant, have moderate or severe concurrent illnesses, or have demonstrated allergy to varicella vaccine (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a painful, localized rash caused by recurrent VZV. Vesicles occur along single associated nerve groups. VZV may be transmitted from the rash of those with shingles to people who are susceptible to varicella; the new varicella infections are manifested as chickenpox, not shingles. It is estimated that more than 30% of people over age 60 will develop shingles. A new vaccine was approved in 2017 and is recommended for people older than age 50 as it reduces the risk of shingles by approximately 90% (CDC, 2020b).</p>
<p class="h8">Influenza Vaccine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Influenza is an acute viral respiratory disease that predictably and periodically causes epidemics and pandemics. Epidemics occur every 2 to 3 years, with a highly variable degree of severity. An estimated 12,000 to 61,000 deaths per year since 2010 have been associated with influenza or its sequelae (i.e., pneumonia, cardiopulmonary collapse). Older adults are more susceptible to influenza, and the incidence of the disease in the United States is increasing as the number of older adults increases (CDC, 2020i).</p>
<p class="indent">Each year, different influenza vaccine formulations are released and are based on predictions of what strains will likely circulate. The CDC recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months get an annual influenza vaccine. There are now many flu vaccine options. Trivalent vaccines are composed of three strains (two type A influenza and one type B influenza) or quadrivalent, composed of four strains (two of type A and two of type B). The formulations can be given as an injection or as a nasal spray. There are different strengths for different age groups and different formulations available for those with egg allergy (CDC, 2020i).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the effectiveness of the vaccine varies from year to year, the vaccine reduces the risk of illness from flu by 50% to 60% overall when the circulating strains are included in the vaccine that year. The vaccine is less effective in preventing illness in older adults but reduces hospitalization and mortality in that age group (CDC, 2020i).</p>
<p class="h8">Human Papillomavirus Vaccine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent of all sexually transmitted viruses and is the principal cause of cervical cancer (see <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a>) (CDC, 2020q). It can also cause reproductive organ and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 is recommended for both males and females. The vaccines are administered in a series according to CDC guidelines. The vaccine is not recommended for those with a history of hypersensitivity to any vaccine component, those with a history of anaphylactic latex allergy, or for women who are pregnant (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4597">Meites, Szilagyi, Chesson, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Planning for a Pandemic</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has published pandemic plans that are updated and revised as new threats are recognized and new containment strategies are developed. The plans address federal, state, and local responsibilities, and the need for coordination with the WHO and other international partnerships and agencies (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4592">Homeland Security Council, 2006</a>). These plans encourage all health care institutions to have their own pandemic plans and to test the components of the plans regularly.</p>
