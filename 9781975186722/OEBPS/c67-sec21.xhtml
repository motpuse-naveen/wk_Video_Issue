<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;multiple trauma:&lt;/b&gt; trauma caused by a single catastrophic event that causes life-threatening injuries to at least two distinct organs or organ systems">Multiple trauma</button></strong> is caused by a single catastrophic event that causes life-threatening injuries to at least two distinct organs or organ systems. Mortality in patients with multiple trauma is related to the severity of the injuries, the number of systems and organs involved, and the severity of each injury alone and in combination. Patients with single-system trauma can also have life-threatening or very severe traumatic injuries. Immediately after injury from major trauma, including multiple trauma or severe single-system trauma, the body is hypermetabolic and severely stressed. In addition, major trauma can cause hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy, sometimes called the <em>triad of death</em> because each of these factors is associated with increased mortality (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4672">Saqe-Rockoff, Schubert, Ciardiello, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3216">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">External evidence of trauma may be sparse or absent. Patients with multiple trauma should be assumed to have a spinal cord injury until it is proven otherwise. The injury regarded as the least significant in appearance may be the most lethal. For example, the pelvic fracture not identified until an x-ray is obtained may cause rapid and massive hemorrhage into the pelvic cavity, but an obvious amputation of the arm may have already stopped bleeding from the body&#x2019;s normal response of vasoconstriction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3217">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of treatment are to determine the extent of injuries and to establish priorities of treatment. Any injury interfering with a vital physiologic function (e.g., airway, breathing, circulation) is an immediate threat to life and has the highest priority for immediate treatment. Essential lifesaving procedures are performed simultaneously by the emergency team. As soon as the patient is resuscitated, clothes are removed or cut off and a rapid physical assessment is performed. Transfer from field management to the ED must be orderly and controlled, with attention and silence given to listen to the verbal report from EMS personnel. Treatment in a trauma center <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2193" title="2193"></span>is appropriate for patients experiencing major trauma. Treatment priorities are presented in <a href="#ct67-4">Chart 67-4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">A trauma alert is typically activated for patients with major trauma who present to trauma centers. Trauma alert activations are based upon specific criteria that are established by the individual institution. The trauma alert mobilizes the designated members of the trauma team, whose composition varies depending upon the size of the hospital and availability of its resources and staff (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Dehli, Uleberg, &#x0026; Wisborg, 2018</a>). Common members of the trauma team include a trauma surgeon, trauma emergency nurse, x-ray technician, and nursing assistant. An advanced practice nurse and a chaplain may also be included as members of the trauma team (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Crawford, 2019</a>). The trauma emergency nurse typically is responsible for assessing and monitoring the patient, ensuring/maintaining airway and IV access, administering prescribed medications, collecting laboratory specimens, and documenting activities and the patient&#x2019;s subsequent responses.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to managing the treatment priorities described in <a href="#ct67-4">Chart 67-4</a>, the trauma emergency nurse must implement interventions that can mitigate the effects of hypothermia. In some trauma centers, the ambient temperature in the trauma bay where the patient with major trauma is treated is kept higher than normal (e.g., 26<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C [78.8<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>F]). Any wet clothing is removed and warm blankets may be applied. IV fluids may be warmed while they are infusing. See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c67-sec22.xhtml#ct67-5">Chart 67-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Large volumes of IV crystalloids might need to be infused to manage the effects of hypovolemia (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>); however, normal saline can exacerbate the metabolic acidosis that ensues. Therefore, the preferred IV crystalloid solution is typically lactated Ringer&#x2019;s. However, large volumes of any crystalloid solution may also dilute the presence of clotting factors, causing coagulopathy. Therefore, the patient with major trauma is judiciously managed with crystalloid IV fluids as needed. Blood component therapy may be required (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>). The trauma team is responsible for continuously monitoring the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic status as well as the temperature of the patient and the ambient environment in order to reduce the risks of the deadly trio of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4672">Saqe-Rockoff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
