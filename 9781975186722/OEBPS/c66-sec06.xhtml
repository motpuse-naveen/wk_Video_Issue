<h4 class="h4" id="s3152">Emerging Infectious Diseases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As defined by the CDC, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;emerging infectious diseases:&lt;/b&gt; human infectious diseases with an increased incidence within the past two decades, or with a potential to increase in the near future">emerging infectious diseases</button></strong> are human diseases of infectious origin that have increased within the past two decades or that are likely to increase in the near future. Examples of emerging infectious diseases presented here include COVID-19, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Ebola virus disease, Legionnaires disease, and pertussis. Bioterrorism agents such as anthrax and plague are also considered emerging infectious diseases because a bioterrorist act would introduce a new mode of transmission for these agents. Other examples, covered earlier in this chapter, include novel influenza viruses, CRE, and <em>C. auris</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Infectious diseases may begin anywhere in the world; therefore, epidemiologists worldwide collaborate to share information about the detection of new diseases, their clinical presentations, laboratory identification methods, and possible treatments. In the United States, the CDC is the central agency for this coordination. The CDC collaborates with numerous agencies, including other U.S. government agencies (such as the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) as well as the WHO and other international agencies, faith-based agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and businesses throughout the world. Elaborate disease surveillance and reporting methods are established with the goal of early detection and control of actual and potential epidemics and pandemics (CDC, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Many factors contribute to newly emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases. These include travel, globalization of food supply and central processing of food, population growth, increased urban crowding, population movements (e.g., those that result from war, famine, or human-made or natural disasters), ecologic changes, human behavior (e.g., risky sexual behavior, IV/injection drug use), antimicrobial resistance, and breakdown in public health measures.</p>
<p class="indent">Emerging infectious diseases are important from an epidemiologic standpoint because their incidence is not stable. When the pattern of disease in a community is not well <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2172" title="2172"></span>understood in the medical-scientific community, patients, families, and others in the community often become alarmed about these diseases. During times of increased concern about bioterrorism, whether triggered by actual events or by hoaxes, nurses have responsibility to rationally separate facts from fears. In discussions with patients and other caregivers, it is important to keep the focus on what is known and to clarify the plan for diagnosis, treatment, and containment.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3153"><img class="AW2-5" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt="img"/> COVID-19</h3>
<p class="nonindent">The COVID-19 pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. As research into the novel pathogen responsible for the 2019&#x2013;2021 global pandemic progresses, new information about the pathogenesis, risks, clinical manifestations, and management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to emerge. Of those individuals in the United States diagnosed with COVID-19, the case fatality rate is estimated to be 5.6% (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4593">Johns Hopkins University &#x0026; Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3154">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">COVID-19 transmission occurs through virus-laden droplets and aerosols exhaled by an infected host while breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Prather, Wang, &#x0026; Schooley, 2020</a>). SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular surface receptors (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>, <a href="c27-sec01.xhtml#ff27-2">Fig.&#x00A0;27-2</a>) (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4607">Vaduganathan, Vardeny, Michel, et al., 2020</a>). In addition, the aerosols of SARS-CoV-2 can accumulate, remain infectious in indoor air for hours, and can be inhaled deep into the lungs (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Prather et al., 2020</a>). The virus multiplies rapidly within an infected host and, unless checked by the immune system, symptoms begin with a week of transmission (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Prather et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3155">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Individuals of any age, gender, and ethnicity can be at risk for infection; however, adults 65 years of age and older, and those who reside in long-term care or skilled nursing facilities are at higher risk of death from COVID-19 (NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, 2020). Some studies suggest that men with COVID-19 have a higher fatality rate compared to women (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4588">Chen, Zhou, Dong, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4590">Deng, Yin, Chen, et al., 2020</a>). While information on risk continues to evolve, <a href="#ct66-9">Chart&#x00A0;66-9</a> lists the demonstrated and possible risk factors for COVID-19 in adults. Having a history of several chronic diseases, particularly if the diseases are not properly managed, appears to be associated with higher risk of severe disease and death (CDC, 2020g; CDC, 2020h). Patients who are immunosuppressed for a variety of reasons (e.g., active neoplasm, organ transplant recipient) are also thought to be at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 (CDC, 2020g; CDC, 2020h; NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3156">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">COVID-19 clinical manifestations occur on a wide spectrum, from mild symptoms that can be managed at home to severe illness with manifestations that can cause multisystem morbid complications requiring care in an ICU setting. While primarily respiratory in nature, mild COVID-19 manifestations may include fever, nonproductive cough, sore throat, fatigue, myalgias (muscle aches), nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia (loss of smell), and ageusia (loss of taste) (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4553">Cascella, Rajnik, Cuomo, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>). See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion of the spectrum of clinical manifestations in the patient with COVID-19.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3157">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with mild symptoms, about 80% of patients, can be managed at home (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Cascella et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>). Those with severe illness are hospitalized (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>). See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion of medical management of the patient with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Nasopharyngeal samples are the recommended method of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 (NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, 2020). Those testing people for possible infection with SARS-CoV-2 either work with their state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or with commercial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2173" title="2173"></span>or clinical laboratories using molecular and antigen tests. The type of specimen collected is based on the test being used and the specific manufacturer instructions (CDC, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by patient self-administration of bilateral nasal swabbing for viral antigen or nucleic acid. Self-swabbing minimizes the risk of person-to-person transmission of respiratory droplets. The act of patient self-swabbing should be observed by a health care provider whenever possible to assure it is performed properly (CDC, 2020a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">COVID-19 Vaccines</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Operation Warp Speed was an unprecedented response to the study of safety and efficacy of new vaccine platforms never before used in humans (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Castells &#x0026; Phillips, 2020</a>). Two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were authorized for emergency use in the United States in December of 2020, less than a year after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence was discovered (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Castells &#x0026; Phillips, 2020</a>). Both vaccines require 2 doses for efficacy, the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech 21 days after the first dose, and the Moderna mRNA 28 days later. Early reports indicated the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had an anaphylaxis rate of 1 in 100,000 compared with a rate of 1 in 1,000,000 for other vaccines (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Castells &#x0026; Phillips, 2020</a>). Ongoing efforts are needed by nurses and all health care workers to maintain a proactive response to support public confidence and reduce vaccine hesitancy. Anaphylaxis is a treatable reaction that requires early recognition and an appropriate and timely response (see <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>). A VAERS form must be completed for any adverse reaction and can be submitted online (see the Resources section). Nurses should be vaccinated for COVID-19 and should advocate for all of their professional and personal contacts receiving the vaccine at the first available opportunity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3158">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of the patient with COVID-19 mirrors that of medical management. The majority of patients with known or suspected mild COVID-19 may be managed on an outpatient basis within their homes, which conserves hospital resources and diminishes the likelihood of exposure to others, including health care workers (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>). Few medications are used to either treat COVID-19 or to mitigate its effects in patients with mild disease who are managed at home; thus, care is largely supportive. The nursing management of patients with mild COVID-19 mirrors that of other viral respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 are most often managed in the hospital setting. Health care workers are at increased risk for acquiring COVID-19 and should wear complete PPE as discussed earlier in this chapter (CDC, 2020c). See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion of nursing management of the patient with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infection. Supportive care for a patient, whether at home or in the hospital setting, requires very careful use of infection control measures and psychological support for the patient and family.</p>
<p class="indent">Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, important measures were recommended by the CDC to help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Nurses should provide education to help patients and their families implement these measures to help slow viral transmission. One measure is to wear a mask with 2 or more layers of breathable fabric that snugly covers the nose and mouth; this type of mask should be worn in public places to help patients and families protect themselves and others (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Prather et al., 2020</a>). One study of mask usage reported that among 139 clients exposed to two symptomatic hair stylists with confirmed COVID-19, while both the stylists and the clients wore face masks, no symptomatic secondary cases were identified (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4591">Hendrix, Walde, Findley, et al., 2020</a>). Another important practice is to &#x2018;socially distance&#x2019; by remaining at least 6 feet apart from others and avoiding crowds. The nurse should also encourage frequent handwashing with at least 20 seconds of scrubbing, rinsing, and drying after washing (CDC, 2002). If handwashing is not possible, then hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol should be used.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3159">Zika Virus</h3>
<p class="nonindent">The Zika virus was first discovered as a pathogen in monkeys in the Zika Forest of Uganda in the 1940s; it was found to cause human disease in the 1950s. The epidemiologic pattern changed as the first large outbreak in humans did not occur until 2007 in Micronesia. The disease was not seen in the Western Hemisphere until July 2015, when a large outbreak began in Brazil. Within the next year, infections were noted in countries throughout the Americas and Pacific Islands (WHO, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">The incubation period for Zika virus disease is estimated to be between 3 and 14 days (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Krow-Lucal, Biggerstaff, &#x0026; Staples, 2017</a>). Among patients who are symptomatic, most have self-limiting illness of 2 to 7 days duration with mild fever, rash, headache, conjunctivitis, or joint and muscle pain. Zika has been associated with microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in infants of some women infected with Zika during pregnancy. The virus can also cause Guillain&#x2013;Barr&#x00E9; syndrome, a condition with nerve and muscle weakness that often quickly progresses to a paralysis (WHO, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Zika is primarily transmitted through bites of infected mosquitos from the <em>Aedes</em> genus. Sustained outbreaks have been more common in tropical areas where these mosquitos thrive. The <em>Aedes</em> mosquito is also the carrier of other mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Unlike these other mosquito-borne diseases, Zika can also be transmitted through sexual transmission. This combination of transmission routes makes prevention efforts especially challenging. People can travel to epidemic areas, and later, as asymptomatic infected carriers, transmit the virus to their sexual partners. Because of the concern about congenital infection, women who are pregnant are advised to avoid travel to endemic areas and to use abstinence or safer sex methods if their sexual partners have traveled to such regions. Similarly, couples with exposure to areas where there is ongoing transmission are counseled in contraceptive options (CDC, 2020s).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3160">West Nile Virus</h3>
<p class="nonindent">The West Nile virus was first recognized in the 1930s in Africa and was first seen in humans in the United States in 1999. Those infected have a range of presentations. Approximately <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2174" title="2174"></span>20% of people who are infected have a mild disease called <em>West Nile fever.</em> These patients usually experience headache, fever, and a persistent fatigue that may continue for several months. In these patients, fewer than 1% of infections develop into more serious disease, which is characterized by severe neuroinvasive illness, meningitis, encephalitis, and paralysis or poliomyelitis. The mortality rate for people with neuroinvasive diseases is approximately 10% (CDC, 2020t).</p>
<p class="indent">The incubation period (i.e., from mosquito bite to onset of symptoms) is between 2 and 14 days. Currently, there is no treatment for West Nile virus infection. Medical and nursing management consists of fluid replacement, airway management, and supportive nursing care when meningitis or symptoms are present.</p>
<p class="indent">Birds are the natural reservoir for the virus, and since 1999, the population of infected birds in the United States has increased steadily. Mosquitoes become infected when feeding on birds and can transmit the virus to animals and humans. Human-to-human transmission of West Nile virus is very rare; however, transplacental mother-to-infant transmission and blood transfusion or organ transplant transmission have rarely occurred (CDC, 2020t).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3161">Ebola Virus Disease</h3>
<p class="nonindent">The first human outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in 1976. For decades, the virus maintained a pattern of sporadic outbreaks in remote African villages, followed by intervening periods without any recognized cases worldwide. In 2014, the virus broke this pattern and rampaged through the West African countries Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, with secondary cases in other countries in Africa, Europe, and the United States with approximately 28,600 cases (CDC, 2020u). Between 2017 and 2020, several significant outbreaks occurred in the Republic of the Congo, with an estimated 3400 cases (CDC, 2020u).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3162">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ebola is spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids (urine, vomit, feces, saliva, sweat, semen, and breast milk) from the person who is ill from the virus and possibly from contact with semen of a man who has recovered from Ebola. It is not spread through air, water, or insect bite. In Africa, it may occasionally be spread by handling infected bats or infected wild animals that are sometimes hunted for food. Ebola virus is only detected in blood after the patient becomes symptomatic and viral levels rise significantly as the disease progresses (CDC, 2020u).</p>
<p class="indent">The incubation period from exposure to first symptoms ranges from 2 to 21 days. If there are no symptoms by 21 days after exposure, there is essentially no risk of developing Ebola. Patients are not contagious to others before symptoms occur. Thorough identification of Ebola contacts and careful symptom monitoring can prevent subsequent waves of transmission (CDC, 2020u).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3163">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The initial clinical manifestations include high fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. Between the third and fifth symptomatic day, the patient often develops severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Patients are at great risk for severe dehydration at this point as many produce over 5 L of liquid stool per day. This stage can persist for a week or more, and many patients develop hemodynamic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Patients may also show increasing neurologic symptoms during that period, such as confusion, agitation, delirium, or encephalitis. Approximately 5% will develop bleeding or hemorrhage, a very poor prognostic indicator. Patients who do not die during the first 2 weeks of the disease are likely to survive (CDC, 2020u).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3164">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">No therapies have been approved for Ebola, but two antiviral treatments are under investigation (CDC, 2020u). Treatment is largely supportive maintenance of the circulatory and respiratory systems. It is likely that the patient who is infected will need ventilator and dialysis support during the acute phase of illness (CDC, 2020u).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ebola Vaccines</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In late 2019, the FDA approved the first Ebola vaccine effective at reducing the incidence of the Zaire strain of Ebola. The vaccine is approved for adults 18 years and older. Patient education is important as potential recipients should be informed that the vaccine has not shown protection for strains other than the Zaire strain, and adverse reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been reported (U.S. FDA, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3165">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management mirrors that of medical management and is largely supportive. Supportive care for a patient with such a devastating disease requires very careful use of infection control measures and psychological support for the patient and family.</p>
<p class="indent">Health care workers are at increased risk for acquiring Ebola because they may have contact with body fluids or equipment contaminated from exposure to body fluids. Because patients with Ebola emit abundant viral particles in body fluids, especially in vomit and diarrhea, the patient should be promptly isolated in a private room, away from other patients. Health care workers should wear complete PPE. Systems must be set up so that an observer guides each worker to meticulously don PPE before direct contact with a patient who is infected to ensure that all equipment is worn correctly. After a worker has direct contact with a patient who is infected, an observer should direct careful doffing (removal) of PPE to ensure that no exposure occurs in the process. (See <a href="c66-sec02.xhtml#ct66-3">Chart&#x00A0;66-3</a> and Resources section for more information on donning and doffing PPE.) Equipment used for the patient with Ebola virus should be used solely for that patient and should be disposed of after use. If equipment must be reused, it should be sterilized or scrupulously cleaned with a bleach-based solution before reuse. Care for the patient with Ebola requires hospitals and transport systems to develop plans to coordinate staffing, supply maintenance, handling of waste, and communication with the public (WHO, 2020). Because care for Ebola patients is so complex, during a time of increased risks, communities are encouraged to assign some facilities as the designated facilities for Ebola care. Other facilities will have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2175" title="2175"></span>the responsibility to carefully screen patients with suspected Ebola and to cautiously transport them to a designated Ebola care facility.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3166">Legionnaires Disease</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Legionnaires disease is a multisystem illness that usually includes pneumonia and is caused by the gram-negative bacterium <em>Legionella pneumophila.</em> Named after an outbreak among people attending a convention of the American Legion in 1976, its potential to cause outbreaks has been demonstrated repeatedly in hospitals and other settings. It continues to be considered an emerging infectious disease because there are new patterns in recent years. There are approximately 5000 new cases each year (CDC, 2020v).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Legionella</em> organisms are found in many man-made and naturally occurring water sources. Although the organisms may initially be introduced to the plumbing system in low numbers, growth is enhanced by water storage, sediment, temperatures ranging from 25&#x00B0;C to 42&#x00B0;C (77&#x00B0;F to 108&#x00B0;F), and certain amoebae frequently present in water that can support intracellular growth of legionellae. Because incidence appears to increase in the summer and autumn months, vacation-related exposure to hotel or cruise ship plumbing and air-conditioning systems, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains may be the causative risk (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4604">Soda, Barskey, Shah, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3167">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Legionella pneumophila</em> is transmitted by the aerosolized route from an environmental source to a person&#x2019;s respiratory tract. In hospitals, patients may be exposed to aerosols created by cooling towers, water exposure from in-room plumbing, and respiratory therapy equipment. Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Because underlying medical conditions can increase host susceptibility and subsequent severity of disease, and because hospital plumbing systems are often very complex, outbreaks occur in hospitals more frequently than at other centers within the community. The mortality rate for Legionnaires disease may be as high as 10%; for those who acquire the disease while in a health care facility, the rate is approximately 25% (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Soda et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3168">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Risk factors for <em>Legionella</em> infection include diseases that lead to severe immunosuppression, such as AIDS, hematologic malignancy, end-stage kidney disease, or the use of immunosuppressive agents. Other factors associated with increased risk include diabetes, smoking, exposure to whirlpool spas, and recent travel (CDC, 2020v; Soda et al., 2017).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3169">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The lungs are the principal organs of infection; however, other organs may also be involved. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days. Early symptoms may include malaise, myalgias, headache, and dry cough. The patient develops increasing pulmonary symptoms, including productive cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Patients are usually febrile, and body temperatures may reach or exceed 39.4&#x00B0;C (103&#x00B0;F). Diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms are common. In severe cases, multiorgan involvement and failure may follow (CDC, 2020v).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3170">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnostic approach generally involves using information obtained from the history, physical examination, x-rays, laboratory findings, and assessment of therapeutic effectiveness. Chest x-ray abnormalities may vary in severity and in location within the lungs. Laboratory tests available for the diagnosis of <em>Legionella</em> include culture or tests that detect either antigen or antibody. The most frequently used test is the urinary antigen. The greatest limitation of the test is that it detects only one subgroup of one of the several species of <em>Legionella.</em> The CDC recommends using multiple tests when Legionnaires disease is suspected because none of the tests is completely accurate (CDC, 2020v).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3171">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The antibiotic agents of choice are azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin. The antibiotic doxycycline may also be used (CDC, 2020v).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3172">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nursing management described for the patient with any pneumonia (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>) should form the basis of care for the patient with <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia. Isolation is not required because <em>Legionella</em> is not transmitted between humans. Legionellosis should be reported to public health authorities. When the patient has acquired the infection in a health care facility, water sampling should be performed to determine if the water supply is contaminated and to verify eradication after water treatment.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s3173">Pertussis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, a common childhood disease in the pre-vaccine era, is an example of a disease that has re-emerged. Incidence rates declined until the 1980s, when rates for all age groups began to increase steadily for the next three decades, peaking in 2012 and plateauing in the following years (CDC, 2020w).</p>
<p class="indent">Pertussis is caused by the bacterium <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>. It is highly contagious, and patients usually present to health care professionals with a paroxysmal (sudden) cough that is accompanied by a characteristic whoop&#x2014;a high-pitched noise heard when inhaling.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3174">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><em>B. pertussis</em> is transmitted by droplets. The bacteria easily attach to pharyngeal epithelial cells, where they release a number of antigens, toxins, and other substances that trigger the immune system. Because most of the disease manifestations are caused by this immune reaction, patients are usually contagious only early in the disease (when the bacteria are still present) and not during the protracted period of cough (when the immune reaction is causing the pathology).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3175">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pertussis causes a range of respiratory symptoms, with cough being the most frequent. It is generally most severe for infants who have not yet been vaccinated. Pneumonia is the most common consequence of infection, but the disease can also lead to seizures, encephalopathy, and, rarely, death. People who have been vaccinated seldom have severe disease (CDC, 2020w).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3176">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most diagnoses of pertussis are made, at least initially, without laboratory confirmation. The clinical case definition, unless there is a preexisting condition to explain the symptoms, is a new cough lasting at least 2 weeks with inspiratory whoop or vomiting after cough. Laboratory confirmation can be made by clinical culture or by polymerase chain reaction assay for <em>B. pertussis.</em> Serologic testing, although less reliable, can also strengthen the diagnostic suspicion. The best source for a culture is a nasopharyngeal specimen obtained by swab or aspirate (CDC, 2020w).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3177">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Early treatment for pertussis is important to prevent complications. The antibiotic agents of choice are azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The antibiotic trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole may also be used (CDC, 2020w). Close contacts of a patient with proven or suspected pertussis should receive prophylaxis with one of these agents to reduce the risk of disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3178">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who are hospitalized with pertussis should be isolated in droplet precautions until they have received 5 days of appropriate therapy. Household members should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis and should be advised to report any symptoms of an upper respiratory infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Immunization is an important element of pertussis prevention. There are two acellular formulations of pertussis vaccine; both are combinations of diphtheria and pertussis. The pediatric formula, called DTaP, is designed for children between 2 months and 6 years. The teen and adult formulation, called Tdap, contains a decreased amount of the diphtheria element. Tdap should be given to children over 11 years, all adults every 10 years, and pregnant women early in pregnancy (CDC, 2020w). All adults who are around infants under 12 months on a regular basis should be vaccinated to reduce the risk of transmitting pertussis.</p>
