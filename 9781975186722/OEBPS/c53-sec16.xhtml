<h4 class="h4" id="s2546">Vasectomy</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vasectomy:&lt;/b&gt; ligation and transection of part of the vas deferens, with or without removal of a segment of the vas, to prevent the passage of the sperm from the testes (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: male sterilization)">Vasectomy</button></strong>, or male sterilization, involves the surgical interruption of both vas deferens&#x2014;the tubes that carry the sperm from the testicles and epididymis to the seminal vesicles&#x2014;to prevent fertilization of an egg after ejaculation. During the outpatient procedure, the surgeon exposes the vas deferens through a small surgical opening or puncture in the scrotum using a sharp, curved hemostat (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-6">Fig.&#x00A0;53-6</a></span>). The vas is then ligated (cut) or cauterized (burned), with the severed ends occluded by ties or clips to seal the lumens and then placed back into the scrotum. A section of the vas deferens may or may not be removed. The spermatozoa, which are manufactured in the testes, cannot travel up the vas deferens after this surgery (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because seminal fluid is manufactured predominantly in the seminal vesicles and prostate gland, which are unaffected by vasectomy, no noticeable decrease in the amount of ejaculate occurs (volume decreases approximately 3%), even though it contains no spermatozoa. Because the sperm cells have no exit, they are resorbed into the body. A vasectomy usually has no effect on sexual potency, erection, ejaculation, or production of male hormones and provides no protection against STIs.</p>
<p class="indent">Couples who were once worried about pregnancy resulting from contraceptive failure often report a decrease in concern and an increase in spontaneous sexual arousal after vasectomy. Concise and factual preoperative explanations may minimize or relieve the patient&#x2019;s concerns related to pain and reduced masculinity. The patient is advised that he will be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1775" title="1775"></span>sterile, but that potency will not be altered after a bilateral vasectomy. On rare occasions, a spontaneous reanastomosis of the vas deferens occurs, making it possible to impregnate a partner.</p>

(Suturing may not be required if a puncture approach has been used.)</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Complications of vasectomy include scrotal ecchymoses and swelling, superficial wound infection, vasitis (inflammation of the vas deferens), epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, hematomas, chronic pain, and spermatic granuloma. A spermatic granuloma is an inflammatory response to the collection of sperm leaking from the severed end of the proximal vas deferens into the scrotal tissue. A painless small lump is formed, which usually does not require surgical intervention.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2547">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing education focuses on self-management of swelling and discomfort post vasectomy. Applying ice bags intermittently to the scrotum for several hours after surgery can reduce swelling and relieve discomfort. The nurse advises the patient to wear snug cotton underwear or a scrotal support for added comfort and support. Explanation of expected discoloration of the scrotal skin and superficial swelling may alleviate anxiety and concerns. These conditions may be relieved by sitz baths.</p>
<p class="indent">Sexual activity may be resumed as desired, usually after 1 week. Fertility remains for a varying time after vasectomy until the spermatozoa stored distally in the seminal vesicles have been evacuated. Sterility is often achieved after 10 to 20 ejaculations following the vasectomy procedure but may take longer. A reliable method of contraception should be used until infertility is confirmed by examination of an ejaculate specimen in the urologist&#x2019;s office at a follow-up appointment, usually 4 to 8 weeks after the vasectomy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2548">Vasovasostomy (Sterilization Reversal)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Men choosing to undergo vasectomy should not consider the surgical procedure as reversible. However, microsurgical techniques can be used sometimes to reverse a vasectomy and restore patency to the vas deferens in a procedure called vasovasostomy. Many men have sperm in their ejaculate after a reversal, and 50% to 70% can impregnate a partner. The success of the procedure depends on the vasectomy method performed and the amount of time since the vasectomy. The procedure can be very costly, is not covered by insurance, is not permanent with occlusion of the vas recurring 2 or more years after vasovasostomy, and results in sperm counts at lower than prevasectomy levels (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Sun &#x0026; Premal, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2549">Semen Cryopreservation (Sperm Banking)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Storing fertile semen in a sperm bank before a vasectomy is an option for men who experience a major life change and may want to father a child at a later time. In addition, if a man has just sustained an injury to the spinal cord or is about to undergo a procedure or treatment (e.g., radiation therapy to the pelvis, chemotherapy, orchiectomy) that may affect his fertility, sperm banking may be considered (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Halpern, Hill, &#x0026; Brannigan, 2020</a>). This procedure usually requires several visits to the facility where the sperm is stored under hypothermic conditions. The semen is obtained by masturbation and collected in a sterile container for storage. Insurance carriers rarely cover the cost of semen collection and banking. The costs of semen cryopreservation vary according to facility, method of sperm retrieval, number of specimens, and length of time in storage, making the process cost-prohibitive for some men.</p>
