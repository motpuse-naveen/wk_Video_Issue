<h4 class="h4" id="s3024">Brain Abscess</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Brain abscesses account for less than 1% of space-occupying brain lesions in the United States (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Brain abscesses are rare in people who are immunocompetent; they are more frequently diagnosed in people who are immunosuppressed as a result of an underlying disease or the use of immunosuppressive medications.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3025">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A brain abscess is a collection of infectious material within the tissue of the brain. Bacteria are the most common causative organisms. The most common predisposing conditions for abscesses among adults who are immunocompetent are otitis media and rhinosinusitis. It is estimated that 40% of brain abscesses are otogenic in origin (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). An abscess can result from intracranial surgery, penetrating head injury, or tongue piercing. Organisms causing brain abscess may reach the brain by hematologic spread from the lungs, gums, tongue, or heart, or from a wound or intra-abdominal infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3026">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical manifestations of a brain abscess result from alterations in intracranial dynamics (edema, brain shift), infection, or the location of the abscess. Headache, usually worse in the morning, is the most prevalent symptom. Mental status changes may occur. Fever is present 53% of the time (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4473">Sonneville, Ruimy, Benzonana, et al., 2017</a>). Vomiting and focal neurologic deficits occur as well. Focal deficits including weakness and decreasing vision reflect the area of brain that is involved. As the abscess expands, symptoms of increased ICP such as decreasing LOC and seizures occur (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3027">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The baseline neurologic examination may reveal a variety of signs and symptoms based on the location of the abscess (see <a href="#ct64-1">Chart&#x00A0;64-1</a>). Neuroimaging with CT scanning with contrast is used most often to identify the size and location of the abscess. Cerebritis is a small infection in the brain that can progress to an abscess if not detected or treated. Aspiration of the abscess, guided by CT or MRI, is often used to culture and identify the infectious organism. MRI is the preferred study, because it provides higher resolution of the lesion and assists with identification of additional lesions if present (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Sonneville et al., 2017</a>). Blood cultures are obtained if the abscess is believed to arise from a distant source.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3028">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment is aimed at controlling increased ICP, draining the abscess, and providing antimicrobial therapy directed at the abscess and the main source of infection. Large IV doses of antibiotic agents are given to penetrate the blood&#x2013;brain barrier and reach the abscess. The choice of the specific antibiotic medication is based on culture and sensitivity testing and directed at the causative organism. Antibiotics should be started as soon as possible; the initial antibiotic started typically is ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole, which will be adjusted based on the culture and sensitivity results (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4454">Brouwer &#x0026; van de Beek, 2017</a>). A stereotactic guided aspiration may be used to drain the abscess and identify the causative organism. Surgical excision is not the preferred method, except in cases where the abscess is large and multi-lobulated (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Sonneville et al., 2017</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2092" title="2092"></span>Corticosteroids may be prescribed to help reduce the inflammatory cerebral edema if the patient shows evidence of an increasing neurologic deficit. Anticonvulsant medications may be prescribed to prevent or treat seizures (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3029">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care focuses on continuing to assess the neurologic status, administering medications, assessing the response to treatment, and providing supportive care.</p>
<p class="indent">Ongoing neurologic assessment alerts the nurse to changes in ICP, which may indicate a need for more aggressive intervention. The nurse also assesses and documents the responses to medications. Blood laboratory test results, specifically blood glucose and serum potassium levels, are closely monitored when corticosteroids are prescribed (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Administration of insulin or electrolyte replacement may be required to return these values to within normal limits.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient safety is another key nursing responsibility. Injury may result from decreased LOC or falls related to motor weakness or seizures.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with a brain abscess is very ill, with neurologic deficits, such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemiplegia:&lt;/b&gt; paralysis of one side of the body, or part of it, due to an injury in the motor area of the brain">hemiplegia</button></strong> (paralysis of one side of the body, or part of it), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemiparesis:&lt;/b&gt; weakness of one side of the body, or part of it, due to an injury in the motor area of the brain">hemiparesis</button></strong> (weakness of one side of the body, or part of it), seizures, visual deficits, and cranial nerve palsies that may persist after treatment. The nurse must assess the family&#x2019;s ability to express distress at the patient&#x2019;s condition, cope with the patient&#x2019;s illness and deficits, and obtain support. Treatment has improved and 70% of patients have no or minimal permanent neurologic deficits, but more research is needed on long-term function (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4454">Brouwer &#x0026; van de Beek, 2017</a>).</p>
