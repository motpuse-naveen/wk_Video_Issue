<h4 class="h4" id="s1965">Hyperthyroidism</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperthyroidism, a common endocrine disorder, is a form of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thyrotoxicosis:&lt;/b&gt; condition produced by excessive endogenous or exogenous thyroid hormone">thyrotoxicosis</button></strong> resulting from an excessive synthesis and secretion of endogenous or exogenous thyroid hormones by the thyroid (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). The most common causes are Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. Other causes include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thyroiditis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the thyroid gland; may lead to chronic hypothyroidism or may resolve spontaneously">thyroiditis</button></strong> (inflammation of the thyroid gland) and excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Graves disease:&lt;/b&gt; a form of hyperthyroidism; characterized by a diffuse goiter and exophthalmos">Graves disease</button></strong> is an autoimmune disorder that results from an excessive output of thyroid hormones caused by abnormal stimulation of the thyroid gland by circulating immunoglobulins. This disease affects women eight times more frequently than men, with onset usually between the second and fourth decades. The disorder may appear after an emotional shock, stress, or an infection, but the exact significance of these relationships is not understood (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1966">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with hyperthyroidism exhibit a characteristic group of signs and symptoms (see <a href="#ff45-6">Fig. 45-6</a>). Clinical manifestations are related to the increase in metabolic rate and increased oxygen consumption. The patient may appear anxious, seem restless and irritable, and exhibit fine tremors of the hands. The patient will be tachycardic and complain of palpitations. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1462" title="1462"></span>Heat intolerance will be noted with increased perspiration. Additional clinical manifestations include an increase in appetite, diarrhea, weight loss, and thin skin. Patients with Graves disease may present with exophthalmos and may exhibit reduced blinking and lid retraction. Treatment may not reverse ocular manifestations (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Medford, 2019</a>). Women experience changes in menstruation including oligomenorrhea (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Lee &#x0026; Khardori, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Cardiac effects may include sinus tachycardia or arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, increased pulse pressure, and palpitations; these changes may be related to increased sensitivity to catecholamines or to changes in neurotransmitter turnover. Myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure may occur if the hyperthyroidism is severe and untreated.</p>
<p class="indent">The course of the disease may be mild, characterized by remissions and exacerbations, and terminate with spontaneous recovery in a few months or years. Conversely, it may progress relentlessly, with the untreated person becoming emaciated, intensely nervous, delirious, and even disoriented; eventually, the heart fails.</p>
<p class="indent">Symptoms of hyperthyroidism may occur with the release of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone as a result of inflammation after irradiation of the thyroid or destruction of thyroid tissue by tumor. Such symptoms may also occur with excessive administration of thyroid hormone for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Long-standing use of thyroid hormone in the absence of close monitoring may be a cause of symptoms of hyperthyroidism. It is also likely to result in premature osteoporosis, particularly in women.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1967">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The thyroid gland is enlarged to some extent. It is soft and may pulsate; a thrill often can be palpated, and a bruit is heard over the thyroid arteries (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). These are signs of greatly increased blood flow through the thyroid gland. In advanced cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the symptoms, a decrease in serum TSH, increased free T<sub>4</sub>, and an increase in radioactive iodine uptake.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1968">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Appropriate treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on the underlying cause and often consists of a combination of therapies, including antithyroid agents, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Treatment of hyperthyroidism is directed toward reducing thyroid hyperactivity to relieve symptoms and preventing complications. The use of radioactive iodine is the most common form of treatment for Graves disease. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (e.g., propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol) are used as adjunctive therapy for symptomatic relief, particularly in transient thyroiditis (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Lee &#x0026; Khardori, 2018</a>). The three treatments (radioactive iodine therapy, antithyroid medications [e.g., thionamides], and surgery) share the same complications: relapse or recurrent hyperthyroidism and permanent hypothyroidism. The rate of relapse increases in patients who have had very severe disease, a long history of dysfunction, ocular and cardiac symptoms, large goiter, or relapse after previous treatment. Patients with Graves disease may sustain remission for up to 12 to 18 months but often experience recurrence within 12 months of treatment (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Lee &#x0026; Khardori, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Two forms of pharmacotherapy are available for treating hyperthyroidism and controlling excessive thyroid activity: (1) the use of irradiation by administration of the radioisotope <sup>131</sup>I for destructive effects on the thyroid gland and (2) antithyroid medications that interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormones and other agents that control manifestations of hyperthyroidism.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radioactive Iodine Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radioactive iodine has been used to treat toxic adenomas, toxic multinodular goiter, and most varieties of thyrotoxicosis and is considered the treatment of choice because a single dose is effective in treating 80% to 90% of cases (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). Radioactive iodine is contraindicated during pregnancy because it crosses the placenta. Women of childbearing age should be given a pregnancy test 48 hours before administration of radioactive iodine. They should also be instructed to not conceive for at least 6 months following treatment. In addition, breast-feeding for up to 6 weeks prior to radioactive iodine treatment is contraindicated (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Lee &#x0026; Khardori, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of radioactive iodine therapy (<sup>131</sup>I) is to eliminate the hyperthyroid state with the administration of sufficient radiation in a single dose (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Lee &#x0026; Khardori, 2018</a>). Almost all of the iodine that enters and is retained in the body becomes concentrated in the thyroid gland. Therefore, the radioactive isotope of iodine is concentrated in the thyroid gland, where it destroys thyroid cells without jeopardizing other radiosensitive tissues. Over a period of several weeks, thyroid cells exposed to the radioactive iodine are destroyed, resulting in reduction of the hyperthyroid state and inevitably hypothyroidism.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of an ablative dose of radioactive iodine initially causes an acute release of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland and may cause increased symptoms. The patient is observed for signs of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thyroid storm:&lt;/b&gt; life-threatening condition of the thyroid due to untreated hyperthyroidism">thyroid storm</button></strong> (see Chart 45-6), a life-threatening condition manifested by cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and neurologic impairment (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>) which may lead to heart failure, circulatory collapse and dangerous elevation of body temperature, all related to the increase in metabolism. Beta-blockers are used to control these symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Thyroid hormone replacement is started 4 to 18 weeks after the antithyroid medications have been stopped based on the results of thyroid function tests. TSH measurements can be misleading in the early months following treatment with radioactive iodine. Therefore, serum free T<sub>4</sub> is the principal test measured at 3 to 6 weeks following administration of radioactive iodine and then every 1 to 2 months until normal thyroid function is established. If TSH and free T<sub>4</sub> are both persistently low, the total T<sub>3</sub> then must be measured to differentiate between persistent hyperthyroidism (T<sub>3</sub> elevated) or transient hypothyroidism (T<sub>3</sub> normal or low). Once a normal thyroid state has been established, TSH should be measured every 6 to 12 months for life (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A major advantage of treatment with radioactive iodine is that it avoids many of the side effects associated with antithyroid medications. However, some patients may elect to be treated with antithyroid medications rather than radioactive iodine for a variety of reasons, including fear of radiation.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Thyroid Storm (Thyrotoxic Crisis, Thyrotoxicosis)</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Thyroid storm (thyrotoxic crisis) is a form of severe hyperthyroidism, usually of abrupt onset. Untreated, it is almost always fatal, but with proper treatment the mortality rate is reduced substantially. The patient with thyroid storm or crisis is critically ill and requires astute observation and aggressive and supportive nursing care during and after the acute stage of illness.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Clinical Manifestations</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Thyroid storm is characterized by:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hyperpyrexia (high fever), &#x003E;38.5&#x00B0;C (&#x003E;101.3&#x00B0;F)</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Extreme tachycardia (&#x003E;130 bpm)</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Exaggerated symptoms of hyperthyroidism with disturbances of a major system&#x2014;for example, gastrointestinal (weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain) or cardiovascular (edema, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations)</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Altered neurologic or mental state, which frequently appears as delirium psychosis, somnolence, or coma</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Life-threatening thyroid storm is usually precipitated by stress, such as injury, infection, thyroid and nonthyroid surgery, tooth extraction, insulin reaction, diabetic ketoacidosis, pregnancy, digitalis intoxication, abrupt withdrawal of antithyroid medications, extreme emotional stress, or vigorous palpation of the thyroid. These factors can precipitate thyroid storm in the partially controlled or completely untreated patient with hyperthyroidism. Current methods of diagnosis and treatment for hyperthyroidism have greatly decreased the incidence of thyroid storm, making it uncommon today.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Management</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Immediate objectives are reduction of body temperature and heart rate and prevention of vascular collapse. Measures to accomplish these objectives include:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A hypothermia mattress or blanket, ice packs, a cool environment, hydrocortisone, and acetaminophen. Salicylates (e.g., aspirin) are not used because they displace thyroid hormone from binding proteins and worsen the hypermetabolism.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Humidified oxygen is given to improve tissue oxygenation and meet the high metabolic demands. Arterial blood gas levels or pulse oximetry may be used to monitor respiratory status.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>IV fluids containing dextrose are given to replace liver glycogen stores that have been decreased in the patient who is hyperthyroid.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Propylthiouracil or methimazole is given to impede formation of thyroid hormone and block conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>, the more active form of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hydrocortisone is prescribed to treat shock or adrenal insufficiency.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Iodine is given to decrease output of T<sub>4</sub> from the thyroid gland. For cardiac problems such as atrial fibrillation, arrhythmias, and heart failure, sympatholytic agents may be given. Propranolol, combined with digitalis, has been effective in reducing severe cardiac symptoms.</p>

<p class="indent">Patients who receive radioactive iodine should be informed that they can contaminate their household and other people through saliva, urine, or radiation emitting from their body. They should avoid sexual contact, sleeping in the same bed with other people, having close contact with children and pregnant women, and sharing utensils and cups. The patient should follow the instructions provided regarding the time restrictions for these cautions because they are dose related (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antithyroid Medications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Antithyroid medications (thionamides) are summarized in <a href="#tt45-1">Table 45-1</a>. The objective of pharmacotherapy is to inhibit one or more stages in thyroid hormone synthesis or hormone release. Antithyroid agents block the utilization of iodine by interfering with the iodination of tyrosine and the coupling of iodotyrosines in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. This prevents the synthesis of thyroid hormone. The most commonly used antithyroid drugs in the United States are methimazole or propylthiouracil. The medications are used until the patient is euthyroid (i.e., neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid). These medications block extrathyroidal conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to initiating therapy with these drugs, baseline blood tests are performed, including complete blood count (white blood cell [WBC] count with differential) and liver profile (transaminases and bilirubin) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). The therapeutic dose is determined on the basis of clinical criteria, including changes in pulse rate, pulse pressure, body weight, size of the goiter, and results of laboratory studies. The patient should be instructed to take the medication in the morning on an empty stomach 30 minutes before eating to avoid decrease in absorption associated with some foods such as walnuts, soybean flour, cottonseed meal, and dietary fiber. Because antithyroid medications do not interfere with release or activity of previously formed thyroid hormones, it may take several weeks until symptom relief occurs. At that time, the maintenance dose is established, and the medication is gradually tapered over several months.</p>
<p class="indent">Toxic complications of antithyroid medications are relatively uncommon; nevertheless, the importance of periodic follow-up is emphasized, because medication sensitization, fever, rash, urticaria, or even agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia (decrease in granulocytes and platelets) may develop (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). With any sign of infection, especially pharyngitis and fever or the occurrence of mouth ulcers, the patient is advised to stop the medication, notify the primary provider immediately, and undergo hematologic studies (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). Propylthiouracil is recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy rather than methimazole due to the teratogenic effects of methimazole. Due to risk of hepatotoxicity, propylthiouracil should be discontinued after the first trimester and the patient should be switched to methimazole for the remainder of the pregnancy and when breast-feeding (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Discontinuation of antithyroid medications before therapy is complete usually results in relapse within 6 months. It is important that the possibility of relapse be discussed so that a treatment strategy will be in place if relapse occurs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Adjunctive Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Additional medications may be necessary. Potassium iodide (SSKI) may be used in combination with antithyroid agents or beta-adrenergic blockers to prepare the patient with hyperthyroidism for surgery. The drugs reduce the effects of hyperthyroidism quickly and help to prevent the onset of thyroid storm. The usual dosage for SSKI is 5 drops every 6 hours. The usual dose of propylthiouracil is 200 mg every 6 hours and the usual dose of propranolol is 60 to 80 mg orally every 6 hours to prevent tachycardia. The patient will need to continue to take the propylthiouracil and any cardiac medication until the free T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels are near normal (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery to remove thyroid tissue is reserved for special circumstances, for example, in pregnant women who are allergic to antithyroid medications, in patients with large goiters, or in patients who are unable to take antithyroid agents. Surgery for treatment of hyperthyroidism is performed soon after the thyroid function has returned to normal (4 to 6 weeks).</p>
<p class="indent">The surgical removal of about five sixths of the thyroid tissue (subtotal thyroidectomy) reliably results in a prolonged remission in most patients with exophthalmic goiter. Its use today is reserved for patients with obstructive symptoms, some pregnant women, and for patients with a need for rapid normalization of thyroid function. Before surgery, an antithyroid medication is given until signs of hyperthyroidism have disappeared. A beta-adrenergic blocking agent (e.g., propranolol) may be used to reduce the heart rate and other signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Medications that may prolong clotting (e.g., aspirin) are stopped several weeks before surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding. Patients receiving iodine medication must be monitored for evidence of iodine toxicity, which requires immediate withdrawal of the medication. Symptoms of toxicity include mucosa membranes stained brown, burning pain in the mouth and esophagus, laryngeal edema, and shock (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1969"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although hyperthyroidism is much less common in older adults than hypothyroidism, patients 65 years and older need careful assessment to avoid missing subtle signs and symptoms. This age group may present with atypical vague and nonspecific signs and symptoms of thyroid disease such as anorexia and weight loss with absence of ocular signs, or isolated atrial fibrillation (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Morton &#x0026; Fontaine, 2018</a>). New or worsening heart failure or angina is more likely to occur in older patients rather than in younger patients. Symptoms such as tachycardia, fatigue, mental confusion, weight loss, change in bowel habits, and depression can be attributed to age and other illnesses that are common in older adults (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). The older patient may complain of difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a chair because of muscle weakness. Evaluation for thyroid disease with a serum TSH measurement is indicated in older patients who have unexplained physical or mental deterioration (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Samuels, 2018</a>). Free T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> should be included in the initial screening when hyperthyroidism is highly suspected. Once thyrotoxicosis is confirmed, additional tests such as radioactive iodine uptake and thyroid scan are prescribed to differentiate between causes such as Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, acute thyroiditis, and other disorders. Toxic nodular goiter is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in older patients. Patients have the option <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1465" title="1465"></span>of treatment using antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Radioactive iodine is generally recommended for treatment of thyrotoxicosis caused by toxic nodular goiter in older patients unless an enlarged thyroid gland is pressing on the airway. Long-term use of certain antithyroid medications such as propylthiouracil is not recommended for treatment of hyperthyroidism in older adults due to potential side effects (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Samuels, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents (e.g., propranolol and atenolol) may be indicated to decrease the cardiovascular and neurologic signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. These agents must be used with extreme caution in older patients to minimize adverse effects on cardiac function that may produce heart failure. The dosage of other medications used to treat other chronic illnesses in older patients may also need to be modified because of the altered rate of metabolism associated with hyperthyroidism.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse initially and periodically assesses the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and the presence of symptoms related to the hypermetabolic state. This hypermetabolic state may affect the cardiovascular system, causing changes in vital signs including heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, heart sounds, and peripheral pulses. Other specific changes may include alteration in vision and appearance of the external eye. Because emotional changes are associated with hyperthyroidism, the patient&#x2019;s emotional state and psychological status are evaluated, as well as such symptoms as irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances, apathy, and lethargy, all of which may occur with hyperthyroidism (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Bauerle &#x0026; Clutter, 2019</a>). The family may also provide information about recent changes in the patient&#x2019;s emotional status.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>NURSING DIAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major priority nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for impaired cardiac function associated with alteration in heart rate and rhythm.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional status associated with exaggerated metabolic rate, excessive appetite, and increased GI activity</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Difficulty coping associated with irritability, hyperexcitability, apprehension, and emotional instability</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Situational low self-esteem associated with changes in appearance, excessive appetite, and weight loss</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for impaired thermoregulation</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hypothyroidism</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of adequate cardiac function, maintenance of adequate nutritional status, improved coping ability, improved self-esteem, maintenance of normal body temperature, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph30"><strong><small>MAINTAINING ADEQUATE CARDIAC OUTPUT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Due to the effects of hyperthyroidism on the cardiac system, it is important to critically assess vital signs, especially heart rate and rhythm and body temperature. Nurses need to be alert to complaints of palpitations which may be reported as &#x201C;my heart is racing.&#x201D; The nurse monitors the patient for signs of heart failure (dyspnea, jugular vein distention, crackles, and peripheral edema; see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In the presence of thyroid storm the patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor in order to adequately monitor for arrhythmias. Monitoring of electrolytes and strict I&#x0026;O assessment is also essential. The nurse is prepared to administer beta-blockers as prescribed. Acetaminophen is the drug of choice to reduce elevated body temperature because medications containing salicylates may result in higher levels of unbound thyroid hormone. A cooling blanket as well as a cool environment may also be needed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Hyperthyroidism affects all body systems, including the GI system. Rapid movement of food through the GI tract may result in nutritional imbalance and weight loss. In addition, the patient will report an increased appetite and should be encouraged to eat small frequent nutritious meals. If necessary, the patient is referred to a nutritionist or dietician to develop a meal plan to address dietary concerns.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Foods and fluids are selected to replace fluid lost through diarrhea and diaphoresis and to control the diarrhea that results from increased peristalsis. To reduce diarrhea, highly seasoned foods, coffee, tea, cola, and alcohol are discouraged while high-calorie, high-protein foods are encouraged. A quiet atmosphere during mealtime may aid digestion. The patient should be encouraged to record weight and dietary intake.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>ENHANCING COPING MEASURES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient with hyperthyroidism needs reassurance that the emotional reactions being experienced are a result of the disorder and that with effective treatment those symptoms will be controlled. Because of the negative effect that these symptoms can have on family and friends, they too need reassurance that the symptoms are expected to disappear with treatment. A calm, unhurried approach is beneficial for the patient. Stressful experiences should be minimized and a quiet, uncluttered environment should be maintained. The patient should be instructed to balance periods of activity with rest.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If a thyroidectomy is planned, the patient needs to know that pharmacologic therapy is necessary to prepare the thyroid gland for surgical treatment. The nurse provides education and reminds the patient to take the medications <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1466" title="1466"></span>as prescribed. Because of hyperexcitability and shortened attention span, the patient may require repetition of this education and written instructions.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>IMPROVING SELF-ESTEEM</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient with hyperthyroidism is likely to experience changes in appearance, appetite, and weight. These factors, along with the patient&#x2019;s inability to cope well with family and the illness, may result in loss of self-esteem. The nurse conveys an understanding of the patient&#x2019;s concern about these problems and promotes the use of effective coping strategies. The patient and family should be reassured that these changes are a result of the thyroid dysfunction and are, in fact, out of the patient&#x2019;s control. The nurse refers the patient to professional counseling as necessary.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient experiences ocular changes secondary to hyperthyroidism, eye care and protection may be necessary. The nurse educates the patient about instillation of eye drops or ointment prescribed to soothe the eyes and protect the exposed corneas. Smoking should be highly discouraged, and smoking cessation strategies are recommended. The patient may be embarrassed by the need to eat large meals. The nurse explains the need for increased food consumption to caregivers and family members in order to address the possibility of their commenting on the patient&#x2019;s increased appetite.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>MAINTAINING NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient with hyperthyroidism frequently finds a normal room temperature too warm because of an exaggerated metabolic rate and increased heat production. If the patient is hospitalized, the environment should be maintained at a cool, comfortable temperature, and the bedding and clothing should be changed as needed. Cool baths and cool or cold fluids may also provide relief.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse closely monitors the patient with hyperthyroidism for signs and symptoms that may be indicative of thyroid storm. Cardiac and respiratory functions are assessed by measuring vital signs and cardiac output, electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, arterial blood gases, and pulse oximetry. Assessment continues after treatment is initiated because of the potential effects of treatment on cardiac function. Oxygen is given to prevent hypoxia, to improve tissue oxygenation, and to meet the high metabolic demands. IV fluids may be necessary to maintain blood glucose levels and to replace lost fluids. Antithyroid medications (methimazole or propylthiouracil) may be prescribed to reduce thyroid hormone levels. In addition, beta-blockers and digitalis may be prescribed to treat cardiac symptoms. If shock develops, treatment strategies must be implemented (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Hypothyroidism is likely to occur with any of the treatments used for hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the nurse periodically monitors the patient. Most patients report a greatly improved sense of well-being after treatment of hyperthyroidism, and some fail to continue to take prescribed thyroid replacement therapy. Therefore, part of patient and family education is instruction about the importance of continuing therapy indefinitely after discharge and a discussion of the consequences of failing to take medication.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>PROMOTING HOME, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND TRANSITIONAL CARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="orange">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The nurse educates the patient with hyperthyroidism about how and when to take prescribed medication and provides education about the essential role of the medication in the broader therapeutic plan. Because of the hyperexcitability and decreased attention span associated with hyperthyroidism, the nurse provides a written plan for the patient to take home and use. The type and amount of information given depend on the patient&#x2019;s stress and anxiety levels. The patient and family members receive verbal and written education about the actions and possible side effects of the medications as well as adverse effects that should be reported if they occur (see <a href="#ct45-7">Chart 45-7</a>).</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">If a total or subtotal thyroidectomy is anticipated, the patient needs to be educated about what to expect. Information is repeated as the time of surgery approaches. The nurse also advises the patient to avoid stressful situations that may precipitate thyroid storm.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4">Continuing and Transitional Care. Referral for home, community-based or transitional care, if indicated, allows the nurse to assess the home and family environment, as well as the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s understanding of the importance of adhering to the therapeutic regimen and the recommended follow-up monitoring. The nurse reinforces to the patient and family the importance of long-term follow-up because of the risk of hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy or treatment with antithyroid medications or radioactive iodine. The patient is assessed for changes indicating return to normal thyroid function and signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Furthermore, the patient and family are reminded about the importance of health promotion activities and recommended health screening.</p>
