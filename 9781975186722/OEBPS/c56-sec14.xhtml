<h4 class="h4" id="s2630">Parasitic Skin Infestations</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Parasitic skin infestations include those of the skin by lice (pediculosis) and the itch mite (scabies).</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m6">Pediculosis: Lice Infestation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Lice infestation affects people of all ages. Three varieties of lice infest humans: <em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em> (head louse), <em>Pediculus humanus corporis</em> (body louse), and <em>Pthiriasis pubis</em> (pubic louse or &#x201C;crab&#x201D;). Lice are called <em>ectoparasites</em> because they live on the outside of the host&#x2019;s body. They depend on the host for their nourishment, feeding on human blood several times a day. They inject their digestive juices and excrement into the skin, which causes severe itching (CDC, 2017).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pediculosis Capitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pediculosis capitis is an infestation of the scalp by the head louse. The female louse lays her eggs (nits) close to the scalp. The nits become firmly attached to the hair shafts with a tenacious substance. The young lice hatch in about 6 to 9 days and reach maturity in 7 days. Head lice may be transmitted directly by physical contact or indirectly by infested combs, brushes, wigs, hats, helmets, and bedding (CDC, 2017).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pediculosis Corporis and Pthiriasis Pubis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pediculosis corporis is an infestation of the body by the body louse. This is a disease of those who live in close quarters. Pthiriasis pubis is extremely common. The infestation is generally localized in the genital region and is transmitted chiefly by sexual contact (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Guenther &#x0026; Maguiness, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2631">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Head lice are found most commonly along the back of the head and behind the ears. To the naked eye, the eggs look <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1839" title="1839"></span>like silvery, glistening oval bodies. The bite of the insect causes intense pruritus, and the resultant scratching often leads to secondary bacterial infection, such as impetigo or furunculosis. The infestation is more common in children and people with long hair (CDC, 2017).</p>

<p class="indent">With body lice, the areas of the skin that come in closest contact with the underclothing (i.e., neck, trunk, and thighs) are chiefly involved. The body louse lives primarily in the seams of underwear and clothing, to which it clings as it pierces the skin with its proboscis. Its bites cause characteristic minute hemorrhagic points. Widespread excoriation may appear as a result of intense pruritus and scratching, especially on the trunk and neck. Among the secondary lesions produced are parallel linear scratches and a slight degree of eczema. In long-standing cases, the skin may become thick, dry, and scaly, with dark pigmented areas (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dlugasch &#x0026; Story, 2021</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Pruritus, particularly at night, is the most common symptom of lice infestation. Reddish-brown dust (i.e., excretions of the insects) may be found in the patient&#x2019;s underclothing. The pubic area should be examined with a magnifying glass for lice crawling down a hair shaft or nits cemented to the hair or at the junction with the skin. Infestation by pubic lice may coexist with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea, herpes, or syphilis. There may also be infestation of the hairs of the chest, axillae, beard, and eyelashes. Gray-blue macules may sometimes be seen on the trunk, thighs, and axillae as a result of either the reaction of the insects&#x2019; saliva with bilirubin (converting it to biliverdin) or an excretion produced by the salivary glands of the louse (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Guenther &#x0026; Maguiness, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2632">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of head and pubic lice involves washing the hair with a shampoo containing pyrethrin compounds with piperonyl butoxide or rinsing with permethrin (CDC, 2019). The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1840" title="1840"></span>patient is instructed to shampoo the scalp and hair according to the product directions. After the hair is rinsed thoroughly, it is combed with a fine-toothed comb dipped in vinegar to remove any remaining nits or nit shells freed from the hair shafts. They are extremely difficult to remove and may have to be picked off one by one (CDC, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with body lice is instructed to bathe with soap and water. Typically, no medications are indicated because the lice live on the patient&#x2019;s clothing. Topical medications used to treat head and pubic lice may be applied to the clothing, however, particularly in the seams of garments (see following discussion about general hygiene measures). If the eyelashes are involved, petrolatum may be thickly applied twice daily for 8 days, followed by mechanical removal of any remaining nits (CDC, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">All articles of clothing, towels, and bedding that may have lice or nits should be washed in hot water&#x2014;at least 54&#x00B0;C (130&#x00B0;F)&#x2014;or dry-cleaned to prevent reinfestation. Upholstered furniture, rugs, and floors should be vacuumed frequently. Combs, brushes, and helmets are disinfected or discarded. All family members and close contacts are treated (CDC, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications, such as severe pruritus, pyoderma, and dermatitis, are treated with antipruritics, systemic antibiotics, and topical corticosteroids. Body lice can transmit epidemic rickettsial disease (e.g., epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever) to humans. The causative organism may be in the gastrointestinal tract of the insect and may be excreted on the skin surface of the infested person (CDC, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2633">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse informs the patient that head lice may infest anyone and are not a sign of uncleanliness. Because the condition spreads rapidly, treatment must be started immediately. Epidemics among those living in close quarters (e.g., dormitories, military barracks, camps) may be managed by having everyone shampoo their hair on the same night. Cohabitants and family members should be warned not to share combs, brushes, and hats; they should be inspected for head lice daily for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment is necessary for all family members and sexual contacts of patients with body or pubic lice. The nurse educates them about personal hygiene and methods to prevent or control infestation. The patient and partner must also be scheduled for a diagnostic workup for coexisting STIs.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m7">Scabies</p>
<p class="nonindent">Scabies is an infestation of the skin by the itch mite <em>Sarcoptes scabiei.</em> The disease is most commonly found in people living in substandard hygienic conditions and in people who are sexually active. People at increased risk include children, older adults, and those who are immune compromised. The mites frequently involve the fingers, and hand contact may produce infection (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4028">Cheng, Mzahim, Koenig, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2634">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It takes approximately 4 weeks from the time of contact for the patient&#x2019;s symptoms to appear. The patient complains of severe itching caused by a delayed type of immunologic reaction to the mite or its fecal pellets. During examination, the patient is asked where the pruritus is most severe. A magnifying glass and a penlight are held at an oblique angle to the skin while a search is made for the small, raised burrows created by the mites. The burrows may be multiple, straight or wavy, brown or black, threadlike lesions, most commonly observed between the fingers and on the wrists. Other sites are the extensor surfaces of the elbows, the knees, the edges of the feet, the points of the elbows, around the nipples, in the axillary folds, under pendulous breasts, and in or near the groin or gluteal fold, penis, or scrotum. Red, pruritic eruptions usually appear between adjacent skin areas. However, the burrow is not always visible (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">One classic sign of scabies is the increased itching that occurs during the evening hours, perhaps because the increased warmth of the skin has a stimulating effect on the parasite. Hypersensitivity to the organism and its products of excretion also may contribute to the pruritus. If the infection has spread, other members of the family and close friends also complain of pruritus about 1 month later (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary lesions are quite common and include vesicles, papules, excoriations, and crusts. Bacterial superinfection may result from persistent excoriation of the burrows and papules (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2635"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adult patients living in long-term care facilities are susceptible to outbreaks of scabies because of close living quarters, poor hygiene due to limited physical ability, and the potential for incidental spread of the organisms by staff members. The vivid inflammatory reaction seen in younger people seldom occurs; rather, the older adult may have peripheral sensory deficits and be less prone to scratch or may be physically unable to scratch. Scratching is an effective mechanism that partially eradicates mite infestation; thus, this results in a more severe subtype. The lesions crust over (causing &#x201C;crusted scabies&#x201D;) and, in time, may become hyperkeratotic (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Health care personnel in extended-care facilities should wear gloves when providing hands-on care to a patient suspected of having scabies until the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment is completed. It is advisable to treat all residents, staff, and families of patients at the same time to prevent reinfection. The scales that are present with crusted scabies must be removed so that the antiscabicidal medication may be effective. Crusts may be removed with warm water soaks followed by application of 5% salicylic acid in petrolatum cream (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2636">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis is confirmed by recovering <em>S</em>. <em>scabiei</em> or the mites&#x2019; byproducts from the skin. A sample of superficial epidermis is scraped from the top of the burrows or papules with a small scalpel blade. The scrapings are placed on a microscope slide and examined through a microscope at low power to demonstrate evidence of the mite (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2637">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is instructed to take a warm, soapy bath or shower to remove the scaling debris from the crusts and then to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1841" title="1841"></span>pat the skin dry thoroughly and allow it to cool. A prescription scabicide, 5% permethrin, is considered the medication of choice. It is applied thinly to the entire skin from the neck down, sparing only the face and scalp (which are not affected in scabies). The medication is left on for 12 to 24 hours, after which the patient is instructed to wash thoroughly. One application may be curative, but it is advisable to repeat the treatment for 1 week (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2638">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient should wear clean clothing and sleep between freshly laundered bed linens. All bedding and clothing should be washed in hot water and dried on the hot dryer cycle. If bed linens or clothing cannot be washed in hot water, dry cleaning is advised.</p>
<p class="indent">After treatment is completed, the patient may apply an ointment, such as a topical corticosteroid, to skin lesions because the scabicide may irritate the skin. The patient&#x2019;s hypersensitivity does not cease on destruction of the mites. Pruritus may continue for several weeks as a manifestation of hypersensitivity, particularly in people who are atopic (allergic). This is not a sign that the treatment has failed. The patient is instructed not to apply more scabicide, because it will cause more irritation and increased itching, and not to take frequent hot showers, because they can dry the skin and produce pruritus. Oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine can help control the pruritus. If a secondary infection is present, treatment with oral antibiotic agents may be indicated (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">All family members and close contacts should be treated simultaneously to eliminate the mites. Some scabicides are approved for use in infants and pregnant women. If scabies is sexually transmitted, the patient may require treatment for coexisting STI. Scabies may also coexist with pediculosis.</p>
