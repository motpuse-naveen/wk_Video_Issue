<p class="nonindent">Nurses have a significant and lasting effect on the way patients live until they die, the manner in which death occurs, and the enduring memories of that death for patients&#x2019; families. The contemporary definition of nursing includes &#x201C;&#x2026;the diagnosis and treatment of human responses, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations&#x201D; (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2015, p. 1). There may be no group more important than seriously ill and dying patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowledge about palliative and end-of-life principles of care and the ability to recognize the unique response of each patient and family to a given illness are essential components <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page368" title="368"></span>required to support the unique values, preferences, and goals of a person&#x2019;s care. Nurses have an opportunity to bring research, education, and practice together to impact the culture of dying, allowing for much-needed improvement to care that is relevant across practice settings, age groups, cultural backgrounds, and illnesses. Nurses in all settings are likely to encounter patients who are seriously ill and families who can benefit from palliative care during advanced illness and at end-of-life. This chapter presents concepts about death and dying in the United States, settings for end-of-life care of the dying, and ways that nurses can address the health issues of patients who are terminally ill.</p>
