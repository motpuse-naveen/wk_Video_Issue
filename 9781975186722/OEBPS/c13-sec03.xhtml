<h4 class="h4" id="s435">Symptom Assessment and Management</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s436">Expected Physiologic Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients approaching the end-of-life experience many of the same symptoms, regardless of their underlying disease processes. Symptoms in terminal illness may be caused by the disease, either directly (e.g., dyspnea owing to chronic obstructive lung disease) or indirectly (e.g., nausea and vomiting related to pressure in the gastric area), by the treatment for the disease, or by a coexisting disorder that is unrelated to the disease. Symptoms should be carefully and systematically assessed and managed. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of symptom management may be used in combination with medical interventions to modify the physiologic causes of symptoms. The principles of pharmacologic symptom management are the use of the smallest dose of the medication to achieve the desired effect, avoidance of polypharmacy, anticipation and management of adverse effects, and creation of a therapeutic regimen that is acceptable to the patient based on the patient&#x2019;s goals for maximizing quality of life.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s goals should guide symptom management. The clinician should help the patient and the family weigh the benefits and risks of continued diagnostic testing and disease-focused medical treatment in the context of their goals for care. The patient and the family may be extremely reluctant to forego monitoring that has become routine throughout the illness (e.g., blood testing, x-rays) but that may contribute little to a primary focus on comfort. Medical interventions may be aimed at treating the underlying causes of the symptoms or reducing the impact of symptoms. For example, a medical intervention such as thoracentesis (an invasive procedure in which fluid is drained from the pleural space) may be performed to temporarily relieve dyspnea in a patient with pleural effusion secondary to lung cancer.</p>

<p class="indent"><em>Anticipating</em> and planning interventions for symptoms is a cornerstone of both palliative and end-of-life care. Patients and family members cope more effectively with new symptoms and exacerbations of existing symptoms when they know what to expect and how to manage them. At the end-of-life, hospice programs typically provide a <em>comfort kit</em> which contains ready-to-administer doses of various medications that are useful to treat symptoms in advanced illness. For example, a kit might contain small doses of oral morphine liquid for pain or shortness of breath, a benzodiazepine for anxiety, and an acetaminophen suppository for fever. Family members can be instructed to administer a prescribed dose from the emergency kit, often avoiding prolonged suffering for the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Although clinicians may believe that symptoms must be completely relieved whenever possible, the patient might choose instead to decrease symptoms to a tolerable level rather than to relieve them completely if the side effects of medications are unacceptable to them. This often allows the patient to have greater independence, mobility, and alertness and to devote attention to issues that they consider of higher priority and greater importance. For instance, a mother may choose to wait to take pain medication until bedtime so that she can be awake and engaged when her children return home from school.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">As death approaches and organ systems begin to fail, observable, expected changes in the body take place (<a href="#tt13-4">Table&#x00A0;13-4</a>). The nurse should prepare the family for the normal, expected changes that accompany the period immediately preceding death. Although the exact time of death cannot be predicted, it is often possible to identify when the patient is very close to death. When death is imminent, patients may become increasingly somnolent and unable to clear sputum or oral secretions, which may lead to further impairment of breathing from pooled secretions. The sound and appearance of the secretions are often more distressing to family members than is the presence of the secretions to the patient. Family distress over the changes in the patient&#x2019;s condition may be eased by supportive nursing care. Continuation of comfort-focused interventions and reassurance that the patient is not in any distress can do much to ease family concerns. Hospice programs frequently provide written information for families so that they know what to expect and what to do as death nears.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the final stages of illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and renal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page378" title="378"></span>disease, pain is a common symptom. Pain results from the disease state as well as the modalities used to treat them. The Worldwide Palliative Care Alliance, World Health Organization (2014) called attention to the continuing, worldwide high prevalence of pain at the end-of-life and the inadequate supply of opioids, particularly in developing nations. A primary role for nurses in end-of-life care is to ensure that pain is assessed, prevented where possible, and managed. <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> presents the importance of pain assessment, assessment principles for pain that include identifying the effect of the pain on the patient&#x2019;s life, and the importance of believing the patient&#x2019;s report of the pain and its effect. Poorly managed pain affects the psychological, emotional, social, and financial well-being of patients. Every clinician should be able to assess and oversee the basic management of pain (IOM, 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">Management of moderate to severe pain in the United States is complicated by public policy and legal challenges due to an opioid crisis (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Foxwell, Uritsky, &#x0026; Meghani, 2019</a>) and federal prescribing guidelines aimed at reducing opioid use (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1112">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016</a>). While patients receiving palliative care are exempt from the opioid guidelines, there are reports of the misapplication of the guidelines for patients with serious illnesses (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Dowell, Haegerich, &#x0026; Chou, 2019</a>). The current context of pain management is also feared to worsen the widely documented disparities in pain treatment in the United States (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1149">Meghani &#x0026; Vapiwala, 2018</a>). Simultaneously, there are concerns about opioid misuse in the palliative care setting (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Hui, Arthur, &#x0026; Bruera, 2019</a>). Thus, palliative care clinicians are also challenged with the imperative to provide effective pain relief while balancing societal risks.</p>
<p class="indent">All patients on opioid therapy and their family caregivers should receive comprehensive education and support to ensure safe use of opioids while addressing fears and concerns about opioid use. Personalized treatment plans should include longitudinal assessment and documentation of pain management goals and needs, management of treatment side effects, use of integrative therapies and interventional techniques when appropriate, monitoring risk of opioid misuse, and longitudinal counseling.</p>
<p class="indent">In their recent position statement, the American Society for Pain Management Nursing (ASPMN) and HPNA maintain that nurses and other health care professionals &#x201C;must advocate for effective, efficient, and safe pain and symptom management to alleviate suffering for every patient receiving end-of-life care regardless of their age, diseases, history of substance misuse, or site of care&#x201D; (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Coyne, Mulvenon, &#x0026; Paice, 2018</a>). The statement underscores the indispensable role of comprehensive and continuous pain and symptom management in all patients and, specifically, in the patient who is nonverbal during the dying phase (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1118">Coyne et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the family caregivers about continuation of comfort measures as the patient approaches the end-of-life, how to administer antispasmodic agents via alternative routes, and how to assess for pain when the patient cannot verbally report pain intensity. Short-acting antispasmodic agents are most effective for uncontrolled pain. At the end-of-life, patients may receive frequent dosing. There is always a strong possibility that a patient approaching the end-of-life will die in close proximity to the time of analgesic administration. If the patient is at home, family members administering antispasmodic agents should be prepared for this possibility. They need reassurance that they did not cause the death of the patient by administering a dose of analgesic medication. In the hospital, nurses need to understand that there is always a last dose of medication in a patient who is dying, but the last dose does not cause death.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dyspnea</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Dyspnea, an uncomfortable awareness of breathing, is one of the most prevalent symptoms at the end-of-life and can be challenging to manage. A highly subjective symptom, dyspnea often is not associated with visible signs of distress, such as tachypnea, diaphoresis, or cyanosis. Although the underlying cause of the dyspnea can be identified and treated in some cases, the burdens of additional diagnostic evaluation and treatment aimed at the physiologic problem may outweigh the benefits. The treatment of dyspnea varies depending on the underlying cause, the patient&#x2019;s general physical condition, and imminence of death. For example, a blood transfusion may provide temporary symptom relief for a patient with anemia earlier in the disease process; however, as the patient approaches the end-of-life, the benefits are typically short-lived or absent.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar to the assessment of pain, reports of dyspnea are typically a subjective report. Also, as is true for physical pain, the meaning of dyspnea to an individual patient may increase their suffering. For example, the patient may interpret increasing dyspnea as a sign that death is approaching. For some patients, sensations of breathlessness may invoke frightening images of drowning or suffocation, and the resulting cycle of fear and anxiety may increase the sensation of breathlessness. Therefore, the nurse should conduct a careful assessment of the psychosocial and spiritual components of the dyspnea. Physical assessment parameters include symptom intensity, distress, and interference with activities; auscultation of lung sounds; assessment of fluid balance, including measurement of dependent edema (circumference of lower extremities) and abdominal girth; temperature; skin color; sputum quantity and character; and cough.</p>
<p class="indent">To determine the intensity of dyspnea and its interference with daily activities, the patient can be asked to report the severity of the dyspnea using a scale of 0 to 10 (similar to the pain scale), where 0 is no dyspnea and 10 is the worst imaginable dyspnea. There is new evidence that the use of the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale may be effective as well (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1107">Birkholz &#x0026; Haney, 2018</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct13-6">Chart&#x00A0;13-6</a>). The nurse should assess the patient&#x2019;s baseline rating before treatment and should elicit subsequent measurements taken during exacerbation of the symptom, periodically during treatment, and whenever the treatment plan changes; these parameters provide ongoing objective evidence for the efficacy of the treatment plan. In addition, physical assessment findings may assist in locating the source of the dyspnea and selecting nursing interventions to relieve the symptom. The components of the assessment change as the patient&#x2019;s condition changes. Like other symptoms at the end-of-life, dyspnea can be managed effectively in the absence of assessment and diagnostic data (e.g., arterial blood gases) that are standard when a patient&#x2019;s illness or symptom is acute and considered reversible.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing management of dyspnea at the end-of-life is directed toward administering medical treatment for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page379" title="379"></span>underlying pathology, monitoring the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment, helping the patient and the family manage anxiety (which exacerbates dyspnea), altering the perception of the symptom, and conserving energy (<a href="#ct13-7">Chart&#x00A0;13-7</a>). Pharmacologic intervention is aimed at modifying lung physiology and improving performance as well as altering the perception of the symptom. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are used to treat underlying obstructive pathology, thereby improving overall lung function. Low doses of opioids effectively relieve dyspnea, although the mechanism of relief is not entirely clear. Although dyspnea in terminal illness is typically not associated with diminished blood oxygen saturation, low-flow oxygen often provides psychological comfort to both patients and families, particularly in the home setting.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Comparison of Dyspnea Assessment Tools</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Birkholz, L., &#x0026; Haney, T. (2018). Using a dyspnea assessment tool to improve care at the end of life. <em>Journal of Hospice and Palliative Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>20</em>(3), 219&#x2013;227.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">There is no standard for the assessment of dyspnea, the subjective sensation of breathlessness. Generally, patients experiencing shortness of breath tell providers. However, when a person is no longer able to report symptoms at the end-of-life, nurses rely on experiential practice to guide dyspnea management. The purpose of this study was to compare end-of-life dyspnea assessment and management before and after educational implementation of Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a pre-experimental study which used a pretest/posttest format to examine the use of the RDOS. Nurses (<em>n</em> = 39) who provide end-of-life care where there is no standardized dyspnea assessment tool were recruited from centers: (1) a hospice agency in the Northeastern region of United States with both home hospice and an inpatient hospice unit, and (2) a medical-surgical unit in a community hospital in the Rural Western United States. RDOS was taught by video where standardized patients simulated mild, moderate, and severe levels of dyspnea in six scenarios. Nurses watched the simulated scenarios and recorded a dyspnea assessment based on experiential knowledge, in a pretest. Then, RDOS education was provided by a palliative nurse educator. Finally, the nurses rewatched the video of simulated scenarios and documented a dyspnea assessment using the RDOS in a posttest.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Researchers found a statistically significant difference in both the nurse&#x2019;s ability to accurately assess level of dyspnea (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001) and the nurse&#x2019;s ability to choose the most appropriate treatment (<em>p</em> = 0.021), after RDOS education. There was no statistically significant difference after education in the nurses&#x2019; determination of overall comfort. The final research question addressed the nurse&#x2019;s evaluation of the RDOS education, where almost all agreed that the RDOS was easy to use with strong recommendation to use in end-of-life dyspnea assessment.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses working in end-of-life care treat dyspnea frequently and tend to rely on previous experiences for assessment and management of dyspnea. The RDOS is a validated dyspnea assessment tool which helps nurses to systematically assess dyspnea. When nurses used the RDOS, there was a significant improvement in both the ability to assess degree of dyspnea and select the appropriate treatment.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">As mentioned previously, dyspnea may be exacerbated by anxiety, and anxiety may trigger episodes of dyspnea, setting off a respiratory crisis in which the patient and the family may panic. For patients receiving care at home, patient and family education should include anticipation and management of crisis situations and a clearly communicated emergency plan. The patient and the family should be educated about medication administration, condition changes that should be reported to the primary provider and the nurse, and strategies for coping with diminished reserves and increasing symptomatology as the disease progresses. The patient on hospice and their family require reassurance that the symptom can be effectively managed at home without the need for activation of the emergency medical services or hospitalization and that a nurse will be available at all times via telephone and to make a visit.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Impaired Secretions at the End-of-Life</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the last stage of dying, patients typically experience impaired secretions. This may be manifested by noisy, gurgling breathing or moaning. In most cases, the sounds of breathing at the end-of-life are related to oropharyngeal relaxation with inability to clear secretions through cough or swallowing due to somnolence. Treatment of impaired secretions in the actively dying is usually achieved with the use of anticholinergic medications to dry secretions (<a href="#tt13-5">Table&#x00A0;13-5</a>). Sounds caused by impaired secretions are generally most distressing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page380" title="380"></span>to family members. Nurses need to educate family members about impaired secretions, provide assurance on the normalcy of the symptom, and distinguish it from dyspnea.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Anorexia and Cachexia at the End-of-Life</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anorexia and cachexia are common in the seriously ill. The profound changes in the patient&#x2019;s appearance and a lack of interest in the socially important rituals of mealtime are particularly disturbing to families. The approach to the problem varies depending on the patient&#x2019;s stage of illness, level of disability associated with the illness, and desires. The anorexia&#x2013;cachexia syndrome (<a href="#tt13-6">Table&#x00A0;13-6</a>) is characterized by disturbances in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism; endocrine dysfunction; and anemia. The syndrome results in severe asthenia (loss of energy).</p>
<p class="indent">Anorexia and cachexia differ from starvation (simple food deprivation) in several important ways. Anorexia is defined as inadequate nutritional intake, while cachexia refers to severe lean muscle loss. In chronic illness, appetite is lost early in the process, the body becomes catabolic in a dysfunctional way, and supplementation by enteral feeding or parenteral nutrition in advanced disease does not replenish lean body mass that has been lost. Similarly, appetite stimulants are ineffective at this stage. Cachexia is associated with anabolic and catabolic changes in metabolism that relate to activity of neurohormones and proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in profound protein loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Near the end-of-life, the body&#x2019;s nutritional needs change, and the desire for food and fluid may diminish. People may no longer be able to use, eliminate, or store nutrients and fluids adequately. Eating and sharing meals are important social activities in families and communities, and food preparation and enjoyment are linked to happy memories, strong emotions, and hope for survival. For patients with serious illness, food preparation and mealtimes often become a constant struggle in which well-meaning family members argue, plead, and cajole to encourage ill people to eat. Patients who are seriously ill often lose their appetites entirely, develop strong aversions to foods that they have enjoyed in the past, or crave a particular food to the exclusion of all other foods.</p>

<p class="indent">As the patient approaches the end-of-life, the family and the health care providers should offer the patient what they prefer and can most easily tolerate. The nurse should educate the family about ways to separate feeding from caring and how to demonstrate love, sharing, and caring by being with the loved one in other ways. Preoccupation with appetite, feeding, and weight loss diverts energy and time that the patient and the family could use in other meaningful activities. Encourage patients to eat what brings them joy. For family members who are struggling with seeing their loved one eat less, the nurse ensures they understand that patients are allowed to refuse foods and fluids. The nurse may also instruct family members how to make ice cubes from frozen fruit juices or smoothies and to offer these to the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Anxiety and Depression</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Almost half of patients in hospice experience significant anxiety and/or depression at the end-of-life as reported by proxy (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1143">Kozlov, Phongtankuel, Prigerson, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Anxiety may be exacerbated by other symptoms such as pain or dyspnea, as well as anticipating symptoms at the end-of-life. A systematic approach to anxiety involves treating the underlying <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page381" title="381"></span>cause, providing psychosocial support, referral to counseling as needed, and administering medications as prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical depression should neither be accepted as an inevitable consequence of dying nor confused with sadness and anticipatory grieving, which are normal reactions to the losses associated with impending death. Emotional and spiritual support and control of disturbing physical symptoms are appropriate interventions for situational depression associated with terminal illness. Patients and their families must be given space and time to experience sadness and to grieve; however, patients should not have to endure untreated depression at the end of their lives. An effective approach to clinical depression includes relief of physical symptoms, attention to emotional and spiritual distress, psychotherapy, and pharmacologic intervention with antidepressants.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Delirium</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients remain alert, arousable, and able to communicate until very close to death. Others sleep for long intervals and awaken only intermittently, with eventual somnolence until death. Delirium refers to concurrent disturbances in the level of consciousness, attention, awareness, and cognitive capability that develop over a relatively short period of time (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Bush, Tierney, &#x0026; Lawlor, 2017</a>). Confusion may be related to underlying, treatable conditions such as medication side effects or interactions, pain or discomfort, hypoxia or dyspnea, or a full bladder or impacted stool. In patients with cancer, confusion may be secondary to brain metastases. Delirium may also be related to metabolic changes, infection, and organ failure. In some patients, a period of agitated delirium precedes death, sometimes causing families to be hopeful that suddenly active patients may be getting better.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing interventions are aimed at identifying the underlying causes of delirium; acknowledging the family&#x2019;s distress over its occurrence; reassuring family members about what is normal; educating family members how to interact with and ensure safety for the patient with delirium; and monitoring the effects of medications used to treat severe agitation, paranoia, and fear. Confusion may mask the patient&#x2019;s unmet spiritual needs and fears about dying. Spiritual intervention, music therapy, gentle massage, and therapeutic touch may provide some relief. Reduction of environmental stimuli, avoidance of harsh lighting or very dim lighting (which may produce disturbing shadows), presence of familiar faces, and gentle reorientation and reassurance are also helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with delirium may become hypoactive and/or hyperactive, restless, irritable, and fearful. Sleep deprivation and hallucinations may occur. When treating delirium, it is important to attempt to treat underlying factors contributing to symptoms first. Much controversy remains on the pharmacologic treatment of delirium at the end-of-life. One study compared the use of haloperidol plus lorazepam to haloperidol alone and found improved relief of symptoms with the medication combination (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1136">Hui, Frisbee-Hume, Wilson, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Unfortunately, delirium is a common symptom at the end-of-life; providing education on this may be the most reassuring intervention for family members.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Additional Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients may experience other common symptoms. Progressive fatigue occurs in most chronic, progressive illnesses, worsening in the last weeks and months of life. At the end-of-life, many patients suffer from constipation as a side effect of medications, such as opioids, as well as the sedentary nature of advanced chronic illness. Nurses should be performing a physical assessment including abdominal examination and last bowel movement. The nurse can administer laxatives (either by mouth or per rectum) as prescribed if patients show signs of constipation.</p>
<p class="indent">Nausea and vomiting may be common at the end-of-life, especially in patients who experienced nausea during disease progression. Patients with malignant bowel obstructions may experience refractory nausea at the end-of-life requiring antiemetics to target multiple hormone receptors or decompression via a gastric tube. Further, skin breakdown occurs as the organs, including skin begin to fail. Diligent nursing care of wounds includes assessment, treatment of pain, dressing changes for comfort, and consultation with wound care specialists.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s437">Time of Death</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For patients who have received adequate management of symptoms and for families who have received adequate preparation and support, the actual time of death is commonly peaceful and occurs without struggle. Nurses may or may not be present at the time of a patient&#x2019;s death. In many states, nurses are authorized to make the pronouncement of death and sign the death certificate when death is expected. The determination of death is made through a physical examination that includes auscultation for the absence of breathing and heart sounds. Home care or hospice programs in which nurses make the time-of-death visit and pronounce death have policies and procedures to guide the nurse&#x2019;s actions during this visit. Immediately on cessation of vital functions, the body begins to change. It becomes dusky or bluish, waxen appearing, and cool; blood darkens and pools in dependent areas of the body (e.g., the back and the sacrum if the body is in a supine position); and urine and stool may be evacuated.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately after death, family members should be allowed and encouraged to spend time with the deceased. Normal responses of family members at the time of death vary widely and range from quiet expressions of grief to overt expressions that include wailing and prostration. The family members&#x2019; desire for privacy during their time with the deceased should be honored. Family members may wish to independently manage or assist with care of the body after death. In the home, after-death care of the body frequently includes culturally specific rituals such as bathing the body. Home care agencies and hospices vary in the policies surrounding removal of tubes. In the absence of specific guidance from the organization, the nurse should shut off infusions of any kind (intravenous or tube feeding) and leave intravenous access devices, feeding tubes, catheters, and wound dressings in place. When an expected death occurs in the home setting, the family generally will have received assistance with funeral arrangements in advance of the death. The funeral home should be called and the funeral director will transport the body directly to the funeral home. In the hospital or long-term care facility, nurses follow the respective facility&#x2019;s procedure for preparation of the body and transportation to the facility&#x2019;s morgue. However, the needs of families to remain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page382" title="382"></span>with the deceased, to wait until other family members arrive before the body is moved, and to perform after-death rituals should be honored.</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients may have elected to donate tissue such as corneas, bone, veins, or heart valves for transplant. Typically, this information would be known to the care team before the patient dies. In some cases, such as late referral or an unexpectedly rapid progression, the patient&#x2019;s wishes with respect to donation might be unknown. If the patient died at home or in a nursing home and the deceased&#x2019;s wishes are known, a team member should contact the organ procurement organization through which the deceased had arranged to donate tissue. That organization will ordinarily transport the body for tissue procurement and to the funeral home.</p>
