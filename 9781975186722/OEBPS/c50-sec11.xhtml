<h4 class="h4" id="s2313">Infertility</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In the United States, infertility affects approximately 1 in 8 couples between ages 15 and 44 (over 7 million women) and is defined as a couple&#x2019;s inability to achieve pregnancy after 1 year of unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Lee, 2019</a>). Primary infertility refers to a couple who has never had a child. Secondary infertility means that at least one conception has occurred, but currently the couple cannot achieve a pregnancy. It is often a complex physical problem and causes are related to endometriosis, uterine factors, anovulation, tubal obstruction, and male factors.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2314">Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Ovarian and Ovulation Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnostic studies performed to determine if ovulation is regular and whether the progestational endometrium is adequate for implantation may include a serum progesterone level and an ovulation index. The ovulation index involves a urine dipstick test to determine whether the surge in LH that precedes follicular rupture has occurred.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tubal and Uterine Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">HSG is used to rule out uterine or tubal abnormalities. A contrast agent injected into the uterus through the cervix produces an outline of the shape of the uterine cavity and the patency of the tubes. This process sometimes removes mucus or tissue that is lodged in the tubes. Laparoscopy permits direct visualization of the tubes and other pelvic structures and can assist in identifying conditions that may interfere with fertility (e.g., endometriosis).</p>
<p class="indent">Fibroids, polyps, and congenital malformations are possible causative factors affecting the uterus. Their presence may be determined by pelvic examination, hysteroscopy, saline sonogram (a variation of a sonogram), and HSG. Endometriosis, even if mild, is associated with reduced fertility (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Schenken, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Male Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An analysis of semen provides information about the number of sperm (density), percentage of moving forms, quality of forward movement (forward progression), and morphology (shape and form). From 2 to 6 mL of watery alkaline semen is normal. A normal count has 60 to 100 million sperm/mL. However, the incidence of impregnation is lessened only when the count decreases to fewer than 15 million sperm/mL (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Anawat &#x0026; Page, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Men may also be affected by varicoceles (varicose veins around the testicle), which decrease semen quality by increasing testicular temperature. Retrograde ejaculation or ejaculation into the bladder is assessed by urinalysis after ejaculation. Blood tests for male partners may include measuring testosterone, FSH, and LH (both of which are involved in maintaining testicular function), and prolactin levels (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Anawat &#x0026; Page, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1666</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1667" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1667">p. 1667</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2315">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment of infertility is complex and often requires advanced technology. The specific type of treatment depends on the cause of the problem, if it can be identified. Many couples with infertility have normal test results for ovulation, sperm production, and fallopian tube patency.</p>
<p class="indent">Ovulatory dysfunction is complex, but many women with ovulation disorders have polycystic ovary syndrome (see <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a>) and may be treated with 5 days of clomiphene to induce ovulation (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Insulin sensitizing agents are sometimes used, and once insulin levels are normalized, ovulation often occurs. Some women have high prolactin levels, which inhibit ovulation, and they are treated with dopaminergic drugs after a pituitary adenoma is ruled out by MRI. If a woman has premature ovarian failure, oocyte donation may be considered.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologically induced ovulation is undertaken when women do not ovulate on their own or ovulate irregularly. These couples are often treated with clomiphene to stimulate ovulation. Gonadotropin treatment may also be used if conception does not occur. Various other medications are used, depending on the main cause of infertility (see <a href="#ct50-11">Chart&#x00A0;50-11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Blood tests and ultrasounds are used to monitor ovulation. Multiple pregnancies (i.e., twins, triplets, or more) may occur with the use of these medications. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) may also occur. This condition is characterized by enlarged multicystic ovaries and is complicated by a shift of fluid from the intravascular space into the abdominal cavity. The fluid shift can result in ascites, pleural effusion, and edema; hypovolemia may also occur. Risk factors include younger age, history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, high serum estradiol levels, a larger number of follicles, and pregnancy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Artificial Insemination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Artificial insemination is the deposit of semen into the female genital tract by artificial means. If the sperm cannot penetrate the cervical canal normally, artificial insemination using a partner&#x2019;s or husband&#x2019;s semen or that of a donor may be considered. When the sperm of the woman&#x2019;s partner is defective or absent (azoospermia) or when there is a risk of transmitting a genetic disease, donor sperm may be used. Safeguards are put in place to address legal, ethical, emotional, and religious issues. Written consent is obtained to protect all parties involved, including the woman, the donor, and the resulting child. The donor&#x2019;s semen is frozen, and the donor is evaluated to ensure that he is free of genetic disorders and STIs, including HIV infection (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ginsburg &#x0026; Srouji, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Conditions must be optimal for conception before semen is transferred to the vagina or uterus. The woman must have no abnormalities of the genital system, the fallopian tubes must be patent, and ova must be available. In the male, sperm need to be normal in shape, amount, motility, and endurance. The time of ovulation should be determined as accurately as possible so that the 2 or 3 days during which fertilization is possible each month can be targeted for the treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasonography and blood studies of varying hormone levels are used to pinpoint the best time for insemination and to monitor for OHSS. Fertilization seldom occurs from a single insemination. Usually, insemination is attempted between days 10 and 17 of the cycle; three different attempts may be made during one cycle. The woman may have received clomiphene or other medications to stimulate ovulation before insemination. The recipient is placed in the lithotomy position on the examination table, a speculum is inserted, and the vagina and cervix are swabbed with a cotton-tipped applicator to remove any excess secretions. The sperm are washed before insertion to remove biochemicals and to select the most active sperm. Semen is drawn into a sterile syringe, and a cannula is attached. The semen is then directed to the external os. In intrauterine insemination, semen is placed into the uterine cavity.</p>

<div class="box14">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Medications That Induce Ovulation</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Clomiphene citrate is an estrogen antagonist that increases gonadotropin release, resulting in follicular rupture or ovulation. Clomiphene is used when the hypothalamus is not stimulating the pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This medication stimulates follicles in the ovary. It is usually taken for 5 days beginning on the 5th day of the menstrual cycle. Ovulation should occur 4 to 8 days after the last dose. Patients receive instructions about timing penile-vaginal intercourse to facilitate fertilization.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Menotropins, a combination of FSH and LH, may be used to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. These agents are used for women with deficiencies in FSH and LH. When followed by administration of human chorionic gonadotropin, menotropins stimulates the ovaries, so monitoring by ultrasound and hormone levels is essential because overstimulation may occur.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Follitropin alfa, follitropin beta, and urofollitropin may be used to treat ovulation disorders or to stimulate a follicle and egg production for intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization or other assisted reproductive technologies.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (leuprolide, nafarelin acetate) suppress FSH, prevent premature egg release, and shrink fibroids.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Bromocriptine may be used in treatment for infertility due to elevated prolactin levels.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Progesterone vaginal suppositories help improve the uterine lining after ovulation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Urofollitropin, which contains FSH with a small amount of LH, is used in some disorders (e.g., polycystic ovarian syndrome) to stimulate follicle growth. Clomiphene is then used to stimulate ovulation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Chorionic gonadotropin, which mimics LH, releases an egg after hyperstimulation and supports the corpus luteum.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Metformin may be used in polycystic ovarian syndrome to induce regular ovulation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Aspirin and heparin may be used to prevent recurrent pregnancy loss in patients with elevated antiphospholipid antibodies.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Assisted Reproductive Technologies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Assisted reproductive technologies include in vitro fertilization (IVF) and its modifications. Currently, between 1% and 3% of all live births each year in the United States are achieved through assisted technology (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Paulson, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1667</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1668" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1668">p. 1668</span></div>
<p class="indent">IVF refers to a set of procedures that, if successful, results in a pregnancy. These procedures involve ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer. The ovaries are stimulated to produce multiple eggs or ova, usually with medications, because success rates are greater with more than one embryo. Many different protocols exist for inducing ovulation with one or more agents (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Paulson, 2019</a>). Patients are carefully selected and evaluated, and cycles are carefully monitored using ultrasound and monitoring hormone levels. At the appropriate time, the ova are recovered by transvaginal ultrasound retrieval. Sperm and eggs are coincubated for up to 36 hours, and the embryos are transferred about 48 hours after retrieval. Implantation should occur in 3 to 5 days.</p>
<p class="indent">Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), a variation of IVF, is the treatment of choice for patients with ovarian failure. GIFT is considered in unexplained infertility and when there is religion-based discomfort with IVF. The most common indications for IVF and GIFT are irreparable tubal damage, endometriosis (see <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a>), unexplained infertility, inadequate sperm, and exposure to diethylstilbestrol. Success rates for GIFT are similar to those for IVF (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Paulson, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Additional Assisted Reproductive Technologies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an ovum is retrieved, and a single sperm is injected through the zona pellucida, through the egg membrane, into the cytoplasm of the oocyte. The fertilized egg is then transferred back to the donor. ICSI is the treatment of choice in severe male factor infertility.</p>
<p class="indent">Women who cannot produce their own eggs (i.e., premature ovarian failure) have the option of using the eggs of a donor after stimulation of the donor&#x2019;s ovaries. The recipient also receives hormones in preparation for these procedures. Couples may also choose this modality if the female partner has a genetic disorder that may be passed on to children.</p>
<p class="indent">Tubal embryo transfer (TET) involves the placement of fertilized eggs or embryos into the fallopian tube. A laparoscopic procedure is needed to place the embryos in the fallopian tubes. Some women choose TET after IVF failure (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Paulson, 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Stress and Anxiety in Couples Who Conceive via In Vitro Fertilization</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Stevenson, E. L., Cebert, M., &#x0026; Silva, S. (2019). Stress and anxiety in couples who conceive via In Vitro fertilization compared with those who conceive spontaneously. <em>Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing</em>, <em>48</em>(6), 635&#x2013;644.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Infertility, which impacts roughly 15% of couples worldwide, is a stressful event for couples. Few studies have examined the continued stress and anxiety experienced after successful in vitro fertilization (IVF). Even less investigated is the partners&#x2019; experience during infertility and IVF. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the levels of stress and anxiety of women and their partners who conceived via IVF compared with each other, as well as compared to couples who conceived spontaneously.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The longitudinal, descriptive pilot study enrolled 48 women and their partners (<em>n</em> = 96). The 22 couples (<em>n</em> = 44) who conceived by IVF and 26 (<em>n</em> = 52) couples who conceived spontaneously were recruited from 2 fertility clinics and a well women clinic throughout the northeast and southeast United States. Participants were asked to complete three instruments during each trimester of pregnancy to measure the perceptual and emotional response components of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The analysis of the instruments across the 3 trimesters showed significant differences between women and their male partners. All women showed greater levels of stress and anxiety during each trimester compared to their male partners. Anxiety was not consistent throughout the pregnancy, showing a gradual decline as the pregnancy progressed. The study also reported no significant difference in the levels of stress and anxiety between couples who conceived by IVF and those who conceived spontaneously.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">It is imperative that nurses and other professionals recognize the impact infertility can have on a couple&#x2019;s level of stress and anxiety. In addition to care of the couple, nurses need to care for the individual, taking into full account the differences in experiences of the woman and her partner during the pregnancy.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2316">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing interventions when working with couples during infertility evaluations include assisting in reducing stress in the relationship, encouraging cooperation, protecting privacy, fostering understanding, and referring the couple to appropriate resources when necessary. Because infertility evaluations and treatments are expensive, time-consuming, invasive, stressful, and not always successful, couples need support in working together to deal with this process (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3665">Stevenson, Cebert, &#x0026; Silva, 2019</a>) (see the Nursing research Profile in <a href="#ct50-12">Chart&#x00A0;50-12</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Smoking cessation is encouraged because smoking, smokeless tobacco, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars, have an adverse effect on the success of assisted reproduction (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Rodriguez, 2020</a>). Diet, exercise, stress reduction techniques, folic acid supplementation, health maintenance, and disease prevention are emphasized in many infertility programs. Couples may also consider adoption, child-free living, and gestational carriers (the use of a surrogate to carry the fetus for the couple with infertility). Nurses can be helpful listeners and information resources in these deliberations.</p>
