<h4 class="h4" id="s1117">Hemolytic Anemias</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In hemolytic anemias, the erythrocytes have a shortened lifespan; thus, their number in the circulation is reduced. Fewer erythrocytes result in decreased available oxygen, causing hypoxia, which in turn stimulates an increase in erythropoietin release from the kidney. Erythropoietin then stimulates the bone marrow to compensate by producing new erythrocytes and releasing some of them into the circulation somewhat prematurely as reticulocytes. If the red cell destruction persists, the hemoglobin is broken down excessively; the majority of the heme is converted to bilirubin, conjugated in the liver, and excreted in the bile (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Packman, 2016</a>). Hemolytic anemias are far less common than other forms of anemia with approximately 5% of all anemias caused by hemolysis (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Schick, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanisms of erythrocyte breakdown vary, but common laboratory features are characteristic of hemolytic anemia. These include elevated reticulocyte count, increased fraction of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, and decreased <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;haptoglobin:&lt;/b&gt; blood protein synthesized by the liver; binds free hemoglobin released from erythrocytes which is then removed by the reticuloendothelial system">haptoglobin</button></strong> (a binding protein for free hemoglobin) as additional hemoglobin is released from the cells. Anemia worsens if hemolysis persists and the bone marrow is unable to replace the destroyed cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemolytic anemia is associated with a variety of conditions. Inherited forms include SCD, thalassemias, G-6-PD deficiency, and hereditary spherocytosis. Acquired forms include immune hemolytic anemia, non&#x2013;immune-mediated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, heart valve&#x2013;related hemolysis and anemias associated with hypersplenism.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1118">Sickle Cell Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by inheritance of the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) gene. It is associated with severe hemolytic anemia. The HbS gene results in production of a defective hemoglobin molecule that causes the erythrocyte to change shape when exposed to low oxygen tension. In some circumstances, even the oxygen level in venous blood can cause this change. The erythrocyte usually has a round, biconcave, pliable shape which in SCD can easily become rigid and sickle shaped (see <a href="#ff29-2">Fig. 29-2</a>). The long, rigid cells can subsequently adhere to the walls of small blood vessels where they accumulate, causing decreased blood flow to the tissues and organs in that region. When blood flow is severely reduced, ischemia or infarction of the tissue can cause severe pain, swelling, and fever referred to as a sickle cell crisis. Because the sickling process takes time, if the patient is exposed to adequate amounts of oxygen, the process can be reversed before the cell membranes become too rigid, allowing the erythrocytes to return to their normal shape. Sickle cell crises are intermittent and can be triggered by cold because of vasoconstriction that slows blood flow.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">The HbS gene is inherited primarily in people of African descent. It may also be seen to a lesser degree in people of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent, and some tribal populations in India (Bunn, 2017b). Sickle cell anemia is the most severe form of SCD and is found in approximately 1 in 365 African Americans (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2161">National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2014</a>). Other less severe forms of SCD include sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC) disease, sickle cell hemoglobin D (SD) disease, and sickle cell beta-thalassemia. Clinical presentation and treatment for these forms of the disease are the same as for sickle cell anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">The term sickle cell trait refers to the carrier state for SCD in which the patient has inherited a sickle gene from one parent and a normal gene from the other parent. Less than 50% of the hemoglobin within the erythrocytes is HbS. Those with sickle cell trait may be unaware that it is present unless severe hypoxia is experienced. Approximately 10% of African Americans have sickle cell trait (Bunn, 2017b). It is important that patients with sickle cell trait understand that if two people with sickle cell trait have children, the children have approximately one in four odds of inheriting two abnormal genes and will manifest SCD (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for additional discussion of genetic diseases).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1119">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of SCD vary and are not solely based on the amount of HbS present. Symptoms and complications are the result of chronic hemolysis and thrombosis. Sickled cells hemolyze rapidly and have a shortened lifespan. Anemia is typically present with hemoglobin values between 5 and 11 g/dL (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). Jaundice is often present. The bone marrow expands early in life to compensate for the resulting anemia, sometimes causing enlargement of the bones in the face and skull. Chronic anemia is often associated with tachycardia, cardiac murmurs, and cardiomegaly. Arrhythmias and heart failure may also occur, especially in adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Any organ can be affected by thrombosis, but those areas with slower circulation are frequently involved, including the lungs, spleen, and central nervous system (CNS). All tissues <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page920" title="920"></span>and organs can be affected by thrombosis in the microcirculation caused by the sickling process leading to hypoxia and tissue damage and necrosis. Patients with SCD are particularly susceptible to infections, especially pneumonia and osteomyelitis. Additional complications of SCD include stroke, kidney injury, impotence, and pulmonary hypertension (see <a href="#tt29-2">Table 29-2</a>).</p>

Prchal, et&#x00A0;al. (Eds.). <em>Williams hematology</em> (9th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill Medical.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Sickle Cell Crisis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Three types of sickle cell crises affect adults. The most common is <em>acute vaso-occlusive crisis</em> (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2144">Kim, Brathwaite, &#x0026; Kim, 2017</a>). This very painful condition is the result of accumulation of erythrocytes and leukocytes in the microcirculation restricting blood flow to the tissue and causing hypoxia, inflammation, and necrosis. Substances released after tissue perfusion is restored include free radicals and free plasma hemoglobin, which cause oxidative damage to the blood vessel. As a result, the endothelial tissues in the vessel become dysfunctional (Bunn, 2017b). <em>Aplastic crisis</em> results from infection with the human parvovirus. The hemoglobin level falls rapidly and the marrow cannot compensate, as evidenced by an absence of reticulocytes (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). <em>Sequestration crisis</em> results when sickled cells are pooled in organs. In young children, the most common site of sequestration is the spleen; however, in many children with SCD over 10 years of age, the spleen has been infarcted and is no longer functional (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). In adults, the most common organs involved are the liver and the lungs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acute Chest Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication in those hospitalized with SCD and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Acute chest syndrome is most frequently manifested by fever; respiratory distress that is manifested with tachypnea, cough and wheezing; and new infiltrates on the chest x-ray (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Jain, Bakshi, &#x0026; Krishnamurti, 2017</a>). It is a common cause of death in young adults with SCD (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Field, 2019</a>). Infection with atypical bacteria including <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and viruses, including influenza, are often the cause. Other causes of acute chest syndrome include pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary fat embolism, bone marrow embolism, and pulmonary infarction. The patient&#x2019;s clinical condition can deteriorate very quickly leading to respiratory failure. Medical management includes blood transfusion, antibiotics, bronchodilators, inhaled nitric oxide, and when respiratory failure occurs, mechanical ventilation. Risk for acute chest syndrome can be reduced through immunization against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia, and with use of incentive spirometry during vaso-occlusive crises, and with blood transfusion perioperatively (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2142">Jain et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Prompt recognition and aggressive treatment can result in good outcomes for this potentially life-threatening condition.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pulmonary Hypertension</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary hypertension is a common sequela of SCD and is a common cause of death (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). The onset <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page921" title="921"></span>of symptoms of pulmonary hypertension is insidious; diagnosis is difficult in the early stages and is usually delayed until irreversible damage occurs. Symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, dizziness, chest pain, or syncope. Pulse oximetry is usually normal and breath sounds are often clear to auscultation until the condition is quite advanced. Pulmonary artery pressures are elevated above baseline but are generally lower than seen with idiopathic or hereditary pulmonary hypertension. Screening of patients with SCD with Doppler echocardiography may be helpful in identifying increased pulmonary artery pressure (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Kling &#x0026; Farber, 2019</a>). High levels of the amino-terminal form of brain natriuretic peptide can be a biomarker for pulmonary hypertension in people with SCD and serve as a predictor of mortality (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Kling &#x0026; Farber, 2019</a>). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest frequently reveals microvascular pulmonary occlusion and decreased lung perfusion while chest x-ray may appear normal.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Stroke</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Stroke is a catastrophic consequence of SCD that affects approximately 10% of patients under 20 years of age (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). Ischemic stroke is most common, especially in young children and older adults, while hemorrhagic stroke is more common in young adults. The mechanisms vary but often result from decreased blood flow due to anemia, hemolysis, and increased hypoxic stress. Silent cerebral infarction occurs in about 40% of patients with SCD who have strokes, resulting in neurocognitive decline (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Vichinsky, 2017</a>). Medical management of stroke includes red blood cell transfusion to reduce the amount of hemoglobin S to less than 30% to reduce the risk of cerebral edema (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">George, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reproductive Disorders</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The adverse effects of SCD on sexual function have become more evident as patients with the disease are living longer. Hypogonadism with associated low testosterone levels, delayed puberty, low libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility occur frequently in men with SCD (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Huang &#x0026; Muneyyirci-Delale, 2017</a>). Episodes of priapism (prolonged penile erection, without sexual stimulation) also contribute to significant pain and decreased libido. Over time, repeated episodes lead to permanent damage and erectile dysfunction, thereby making priapism a medical emergency that needs early recognition and treatment to preserve normal sexual function (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2129">Field, Vemulakonda, DeBaun, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). In addition to physical signs and symptoms, these problems can also lead to embarrassment and depression.</p>
<p class="indent">In young women, menarche may be delayed, but menstrual patterns are generally normal. Fertility problems in women are not well described. Contraception is important when hydroxyurea is used in SCD treatment because of its teratogenic effects. Concerns about infertility may be associated with poor adherence to hydroxyurea therapy. Although most pregnancies complicated by maternal SCD are likely to result in live births, these pregnancies are at increased risk of obstetrical and fetal complications, as well as medical complications of SCD (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Vichinsky, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1120">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with sickle cell trait usually has a normal hemoglobin level, normal hematocrit, and normal blood smear. Conversely, the patient with SCD has a low hematocrit and sickled cells on the blood smear. The white blood cell count and platelet count are often elevated as a result of a chronic inflammatory state (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). Abnormal hemoglobin is identified by hemoglobin electrophoresis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1121">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with SCD are typically diagnosed in childhood, with anemia often occurring in infancy and crises beginning as early as 1 or 2 years of age. Some children die in the first few years of life as a result of infection; however, outcomes have improved considerably in recent years. Average life expectancy is lower than the general population, rarely exceeding the sixth decade (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Field, 2019</a>). Young adults often experience multiple, severe complications from their disease. A subgroup of patients experiences a decrease in symptoms and complications after age 30; however, at present there is no means to predict who will fall into this group. Death is most often caused by cardiac, lung, kidney, or neurologic complications, or from infection (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Field, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of SCD is the focus of continued research. In addition to aggressive management of symptoms, including pain, and complications, there are a few primary treatment modalities.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</h6>
<p class="nonindent">HSCT may cure SCD. However, this treatment modality is available to only a small subset of affected patients, either due to a lack of compatible donors or due to severe organ damage (e.g., renal, liver, lung) that may be already present in the patient (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of HSCT).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For patients with SCD, hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent that is effective in increasing levels of fetal hemoglobin (i.e., hemoglobin F), which in turn decreases the formation of sickled cells. It is the only drug currently approved by the FDA for treatment of SCD. Studies have demonstrated that patients with SCD who received hydroxyurea experienced fewer episodes of painful crisis, had a lower incidence of acute chest syndrome, and needed fewer transfusions (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2156">Matte, Zorzi, &#x0026; De Franceschi, 2019</a>). Additional studies have shown a 40% decrease in mortality in patients receiving hydroxyurea (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). It is unknown whether hydroxyurea can prevent or reverse organ damage. Side effects of the drug include chronic lowering of the leukocyte count, teratogenesis, and potential for later development of a malignancy. Patients&#x2019; response to the drug can vary widely. The incidence and severity of side effects are variable. Adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen may be difficult for some patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with SCD often require daily folic acid supplements to maintain the amount needed for increased erythropoiesis to counteract the effects of hemolysis. Infections are common and should be treated promptly with the appropriate antibiotics. Pneumococcal pneumonia is common in children with SCD while in adults, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection is more common, involving bones and joints (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). Patients should be immunized against pneumococcal infection and receive annual influenza vaccines.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 921</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page922" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="922">p. 922</span></div>
<p class="indent">Acute chest syndrome is managed by prompt treatment with antibiotics. Incentive spirometry has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications. In severe cases, bronchoscopy may be needed to identify the source of acute chest syndrome symptoms. Hydration is important but must be monitored carefully to avoid fluid overload. Corticosteroids may also be helpful. Transfusion can reduce hypoxia. Pulmonary function should be monitored carefully to detect symptoms of pulmonary hypertension as soon as possible so that therapies, including hydroxyurea and HSCT, can be of the greatest benefit.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transfusion Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">RBC transfusions have been shown to be highly effective in several situations: in an acute exacerbation of anemia (e.g., aplastic crisis, severe vaso-occlusive crisis), in the prevention of severe complications from anesthesia and surgery, in improving the response to infection (when it results in exacerbated anemia), in the case of acute chest syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and in thwarting the cerebral edema from a stroke. Transfusions are also effective in diminishing episodes of sickle cell crisis in pregnant women, although such transfusions do not improve fetal survival. Ongoing transfusion therapy may be effective in preventing or managing complications from SCD by keeping the HbS level to less than 30% (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">DeBaun, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Transfusions are not without risks, so it is important to consider the risks of complications versus benefits. Complications include difficulty with venous access, which necessitates placement of a vascular access device, and the concomitant risk for access site infection and thrombosis. Additional risks include other infections, particularly hepatitis; delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions; and iron overload that requires treatment with chelating agents.</p>
<p class="indent">Iron overload is very likely with long-term/ongoing transfusion therapy, causing deposition of iron in vital organs, including the liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, and pituitary gland. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish organ damage associated with the disease process from damage associated with iron overload. Iron chelation therapy, aimed at keeping iron levels at near normal, reduces complications (see <a href="c30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a> for further discussion of chelation therapy) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Coates &#x0026; Wood, 2017</a>). An additional complication of transfusion therapy is increased blood viscosity without reduction in the concentration of hemoglobin S. Exchange transfusion, where some of the patient&#x2019;s blood is removed and replaced by RBC transfusion, may reduce the risk of increasing blood viscosity (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2123">Davis, Allard, Qureshi, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Additionally, repeated transfusions may result in development of multiple antibodies to other blood antigens, making cross matching increasingly difficult, and lead to increased risk for hemolytic transfusion reaction. This phenomenon is referred to as alloimmunization (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2123">Davis et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Some patients who are alloimmunized have an increased risk of avascular necrosis, end-organ damage, and death (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Holmes-Maybank, Martin, &#x0026; Duckett, 2017</a>). Hemolytic transfusion reaction may mimic the signs and symptoms of sickle cell crisis. A distinguishing feature of a hemolytic reaction versus sickle cell crisis is that the patient becomes more anemic after the transfusion than before. Close observation after hemolytic transfusion reaction is needed and further transfusion should be avoided until after the hemolytic process subsides. Patients are supported with corticosteroids, such as prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and erythropoietin alfa.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Supportive Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Supportive care is essential for patients with SCD. Pain management is a significant problem. Acute pain is most often associated with vaso-occlusive crisis and is the frequent reason for hospitalization and emergency department visits in people with SCD. Pain may also be neuropathic in nature stemming from damage or inflammation of nerves as seen with avascular necrosis and leg ulcers (see <a href="#ff29-3">Fig. 29-3</a>). Chronic non-neuropathic pain may result from CNS dysfunction, including CNS sensitivity to peripheral afferent pain signals, or differences in psychosocial aspects of pain perception (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Darbari &#x0026; Brandow, 2017</a>). Pain severity may interfere with ability to work, even when patients do seek assistance with pain management from health care providers.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of medications for acute pain relief is critical and should be appropriate for the etiology of the pain. Aspirin may be useful in patients with mild pain; it decreases inflammation and risk for potential thrombosis (because it inhibits platelet adhesion). NSAIDs are useful for moderate pain or in combination with opioid analgesics. While there is no risk of developing tolerance to NSAIDs there is a &#x201C;ceiling effect&#x201D; by which increased doses do not improve analgesia but increase the risk for adverse effects. NSAID use must be monitored carefully because of the risk for renal dysfunction and GI bleeding. Severe acute pain is most often treated with parenteral opioids (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Okwerekwu &#x0026; Skirvin, 2018</a>). Patient-controlled analgesia is frequently used for this purpose in the acute care setting (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for additional information on pain management). Neuropathic pain can be effectively managed with gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Sharma &#x0026; Brandow, 2019</a>). With chronic pain management, the principal goal is to maximize functioning; pain may not be completely eliminated without sacrificing function. This concept <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page923" title="923"></span>may be difficult for patients to understand and ongoing education and support is often needed. Nonpharmacologic pain management strategies are important in this setting. Such strategies include physical therapy including heat, massage and exercise; occupational therapy; cognitive and behavioral therapies, including distraction and relaxation techniques; and support groups (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Okwerekwu &#x0026; Skirvin, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Hydration is critical during a painful crisis. Oral hydration may be sufficient if the patient is able to maintain adequate intake. IV hydration may be needed if the patient is unable to consume 2 to 3 L of fluid during a crisis episode. Supplemental oxygen may also be needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Another significant problem for people with SCD is fatigue. Fatigue can interfere with ability to perform effectively at work and school and reduce quality of life. Its causes, as with pain, may be multifactorial. Fatigue may occur in response to hypoxia associated with low levels of normal hemoglobin and decreased capacity to carry oxygen with sickled cells. Endothelial cells in the blood vessels become inflamed as a result of hypoxia. Inflammatory cytokines are increased in patients with SCD resulting in reduced muscle strength and decreased exercise capacity, increased resting energy expenditure, and sleep disturbances, all exacerbating fatigue. Sleep disturbances and depression are common and contribute to fatigue (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2108">Ahmadi, Poormansouri, Beiranvand, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Working with patients who have multiple episodes of severe pain and fatigue can be challenging. Health care providers must recognize that patients with SCD are confronted with lifelong experiences with severe pain and fatigue that impair physical and social functioning that may be associated with depression and helplessness. Patients without adequate sources of support may have more issues with coping.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient is asked to identify factors that precipitated previous crises and measures taken to prevent and manage crises. If a sickle cell crisis is suspected, the nurse needs to determine whether the pain currently experienced is the same as or different from the pain typically encountered in crisis. Pain levels should always be assessed (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). A similar assessment should be made of the patient&#x2019;s fatigue, including the impact of fatigue on the current lifestyle, quality of life, and the extent that the fatigue influences pain and interferes with sleep.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because the sickling process can interrupt circulation in any organ or tissues, a thorough assessment of all body systems is needed. Particular attention should be placed on assessing pain, swelling, and fever. Careful examination of all joints for pain and swelling is necessary. The abdomen is assessed for pain and tenderness because of the possibility of splenic infarction.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The cardiovascular and respiratory systems must also be assessed carefully. These assessments include measurement of oxygen saturation, auscultation of breath sounds, and recognition of signs of cardiac failure, including the presence of dependent edema, increased size of the point of maximum impulse, and cardiomegaly (as seen on a chest x-ray). The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of dehydration by a history of reduced fluid intake, and careful examination of mucous membranes, skin turgor, urine output, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A meticulous neurologic examination is essential to identify symptoms of cerebral hypoxia, but it is also important to recognize that evidence of ischemia may be present on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Doppler studies before becoming evident on the physical examination. MRI or Doppler may be used for early diagnosis resulting in improved patient outcomes because therapy can be initiated promptly. Cognitive dysfunction is often present and may reflect reduced blood flow and oxygenation to the brain. Assessment for neurologic abnormalities is important in identifying silent cerebral ischemia or infarction.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Assessment for the presence of infectious processes is crucial as many patients with SCD are susceptible to infection. Special attention should be paid to examination of the chest, long bones, and femoral head because pneumonia and osteomyelitis are particularly common. Leg ulcers are common, frequently recurrent, occur in as many as 75% of adults with SCD, and may become infected and slow to heal (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2127">El Khatib &#x0026; Hayek, 2016</a>) (see <a href="#ff29-3">Fig. 29-3</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The degree of anemia and ability of the bone marrow to replenish erythrocytes are assessed with hemoglobin level, hematocrit, and reticulocyte counts, and comparing these to baseline values. The patient&#x2019;s current and past history of medical care must also be obtained, particularly long-term transfusion therapy, hydroxyurea treatment, and prior treatment of infections.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> P<span class="small">AIN</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Acute pain during a sickle cell crisis can be unpredictable and severe. The patient&#x2019;s subjective description of pain rating on a pain scale is useful in directing its treatment (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). Swollen joints should be supported and elevated until swelling subsides. Relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, yoga, and self-hypnosis may be helpful to some patients in coping with pain (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">DeBaun &#x0026; Vichinsky, 2019</a>). Following acute pain episodes, aggressive measures should be taken to preserve joint function. Physical therapy, whirlpool baths, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are among modalities that may be used. While heat packs may be helpful, cold packs and ice should be avoided as cold may precipitate sickling (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">DeBaun &#x0026; Vichinsky, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">It is not unusual for patients to have difficulty coping with repeated episodes of acute pain and with chronic pain, making adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen difficult. Some patients with SCD develop substance use disorder although the incidence of substance abuse among people with SCD is not unlike that of patients with other chronic conditions (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Natrajan &#x0026; Kutlar, 2016</a>). This can be a result of inadequate treatment of acute pain during episodes of crisis, which then leads to a lack of trust of the health care system and of health care providers. Research findings suggest that prompt treatment of pain during vaso-occlusive crises can improve patient satisfaction with care and also decrease patient length of stay or treatment times (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2144">Kim et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="#ct29-4">Chart 29-4</a> Nursing Research Profile: Acute Pain Management for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> F<span class="small">ATIGUE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Fatigue experienced with SCD may be acute or chronic. Assisting the patient to find a balance between activity and rest is important. Patients need to develop strategies to help cope with the demands on their lives while dealing with their fatigue. Maximizing nutrition, hydration, adequate sleep, and tissue perfusion can all help to minimize fatigue. Research is needed to better understand fatigue in this patient population and identify the most effective ways to relieve it. Although there are validated scales that have been used to quantify the extent of fatigue in patients with SCD, such as the PROMIS Fatigue short form<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>, standards for when to assess fatigue are currently lacking (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2113">Aslani, Georgios, &#x0026; Maria, 2018</a>; <a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2138">Hildenbrand, Quinn, Mara, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING AND</span> M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> I<span class="small">NFECTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing care focuses on monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Prescribed antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. If oral antibiotics are prescribed at home, patients and caregivers must understand the importance of completing the entire course of antibiotics. Patients should be encouraged to seek immunizations per the latest guidelines (see <a href="c03-sec05.xhtml#tt3-3">Chapter 3, Table 3-3</a>), particularly the pneumonia and influenza vaccines.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> C<span class="small">OPING</span> S<span class="small">KILLS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">SCD may cause patients to feel powerless and lacking in self-worth because of the health problems associated with repeated crises and chronic health conditions. These feelings can be exacerbated when pain and fatigue are not well controlled. Optimizing management of pain and fatigue are critical in helping patients to cope with their illness. Listening to and advocating for the needs of patients is important for building <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page925" title="925"></span>a therapeutic relationship based on mutual respect and trust. Nursing care that focuses on patients&#x2019; strengths and not their deficits aids in promoting effective coping. Providing patients with opportunities to make decisions about their care can help foster autonomy and a sense of control. Supportive guidance can help patients understand the importance of adhering to their therapeutic regimen.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Acute Pain Management for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Kim, S., Brathwaite, R., &#x0026; Kim, O. (2017). Evidence-based practice standard care for acute pain management in adults with sickle cell disease in an urgent care center. <em>Quality Management in Healthcare</em><em>,</em> <em>26</em>(2), 108&#x2013;115.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are the most common reason patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) seek emergency or urgent care services. Evidence-based guidelines specify that patients with SCD who seek urgent care for treatment of VOE should receive analgesics quickly. However, these guidelines are not followed by many clinicians, resulting in poorly managed pain in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to find whether implementing a VOE analgesic care algorithm in an urgent care (UC) center would decrease patient time to receipt of analgesics, improve patient satisfaction with care, and decrease length of treatment time.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The setting for this study was an urban tertiary care UC center. Eligible participants were adults at least 18 years of age who sought care at the UC center for VOE from SCD. A Quality Improvement (QI) best practice VOE analgesic intervention was conducted with UC center staff so that all were educated to follow the algorithm. Data were collected over 6 months. Time to administration of first analgesic medication for participants postintervention (<em>n</em> = 63) was compared with historical controls preintervention (<em>n</em> = 61), as were participant reports of satisfaction with care and their length of stay in the UC center.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The mean time to administration of analgesics decreased significantly from pre- to postintervention, from 92 minutes to 62 minutes (<em>p</em> = 0.001). Likewise, participant satisfaction with care improved from pre- to postintervention (<em>p</em> = 0.002) and mean time in the UC center decreased significantly from pre- to postintervention, from 283 minutes to 256 minutes (<em>p</em> = 0.01).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that administering analgesics quicker to patients with SCD complicated with VOE not only mitigates their pain, but may also improve their satisfaction with care, and decrease their time in treatment. This may indirectly help to foster patient trust of the health care system and of providers. Nurses can leverage findings from this study to replicate this best practice algorithm and improve the care of patients with SCD complicated with VOE.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with SCD benefit greatly from understanding the circumstances that may precipitate a sickle cell crisis and the steps they can take to prevent or diminish the symptoms they may experience during a crisis. Keeping warm, reducing risks for infection, and maintaining adequate hydration can be effective in reducing the occurrence and severity of crises.</p>

<p class="processppara">Many of the measures for managing potential complications have already been described. Other measures follow.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="yellon">Leg Ulcers.</span> Leg ulcers require careful management and protection from trauma and contamination. Referral to a wound-ostomy-continence nurse or other wound care specialist may facilitate healing and promote prevention. If leg ulcers fail to heal, skin grafting may be needed (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2127">El Khatib &#x0026; Hayek, 2016</a>). Meticulous aseptic technique during wound care is needed to reduce risk for hospital-acquired wound infections.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="yellon">Priapism and Impotence.</span> Male patients may experience sudden, painful erection known as priapism. Initial management can include warm compresses or warm bath, and mild to moderate exercise, oral hydration, and masturbation with ejaculation (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2129">Field et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If the priapism persists longer than 3 hours the patient should seek medical attention; treatment may consist of IV hydration, administration of analgesics, and possible aspiration of blood from the corpus carvernosa with or without injection of a sympathomimetic drug (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Al-Qudah, 2016</a>; <a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2129">Field et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="yellon">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Because patients with SCD are typically diagnosed during childhood, their parents typically participate in the initial education. As the child ages, educational interventions prepare the child to assume more responsibility for self-care. Most families can learn about vascular access device management and chelation therapy. Nurses in outpatient facilities or home health nurses may need to provide follow-up care for patients with vascular access devices.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4n"><span class="yellon">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> The illness trajectory of SCD is highly variable, often with unpredictable episodes of complications or crises. Care is frequently on an emergency basis, especially for some patients with pain management problems. All health care providers who offer services to patients with SCD and their families must communicate regularly with each other. Alternative methods of care delivery including day hospitals for acute symptom management and patient-centered medical homes, where multidisciplinary care is emphasized, are available in some regions. Nurses play an important role in serving as coordinators and facilitators of care by communicating with health care providers in a variety of settings to optimize the care of patients. Patient education about which parameters are important to monitor and how to monitor them is also a critical role for nurses. Making certain that patients understand when to seek urgent care for acute problems is essential.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1122">Thalassemias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The thalassemias are a group of hereditary anemias characterized by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypochromia:&lt;/b&gt; pallor within the RBCs caused by decreased hemoglobin content">hypochromia</button></strong> (an abnormal decrease in the hemoglobin content of erythrocytes), extreme <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;microcytosis:&lt;/b&gt; smaller-than normal RBCs">microcytosis</button></strong> (smaller than normal size erythrocytes), hemolysis, and variable degrees of anemia. The thalassemias occur worldwide, but the highest prevalence is found in people of Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian ancestry (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Weatherall, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Thalassemias are associated with impaired hemoglobin synthesis so that one or more globulin chains in the hemoglobin molecule are reduced. When this occurs, the imbalance in the configuration of the hemoglobin molecule causes it to precipitate in premature or mature erythrocytes. This increases the rigidity of erythrocytes, leading to premature cell destruction.</p>
<p class="indent">Thalassemias are classified into two major groups according to which hemoglobin chain is affected, alpha or beta. The alpha-thalassemias occur mainly in people of Southeast Asian and eastern Mediterranean descent (i.e., Middle Eastern), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page926" title="926"></span>and the beta-thalassemias are most prevalent in those of African descent. Thalassemias are not limited to any geographic region because of extensive immigration (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Weatherall, 2016</a>). Symptoms of the alpha-thalassemias are typically less severe than those of beta-thalassemias. In alpha-thalassemias, erythrocytes are often quite microcytic but anemia, when present, is usually mild.</p>
<p class="indent">The severity of beta-thalassemia varies depending on the extent to which the hemoglobin chains are affected. Patients with mild forms have microcytosis and mild anemia. When untreated, severe beta-thalassemia (i.e., thalassemia major or Cooley&#x2019;s anemia) can be fatal within the first few years of life. HSCT offers a chance of cure. When this is not possible, treatment consists of PRBC transfusion and iron chelation therapy, as needed (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Fibach &#x0026; Rachmilewitz, 2017</a>). Patient education for adolescents and young adults should include preconception counseling about the risk of thalassemia major in offspring (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for discussion about genetic counseling and evaluation services).</p>
<p class="indent">Thalassemia major is characterized by severe anemia, profound hemolysis, and ineffective erythropoiesis. With early initiation of regular transfusions with PRBCs, growth and development through childhood is supported. Iron overload that can result from multiple transfusions can lead to organ dysfunction. Regular chelation therapy can reduce complications associated with iron overload and prolong life in those with thalassemia major. Long-term survivors of beta thalassemia may experience neurologic complications including cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Fibach &#x0026; Rachmilewitz, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1123">Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) gene is responsible for the abnormality seen in this disorder. The gene produces an enzyme within the erythrocyte that is necessary to stabilize the cell membrane. Some patients produce an enzyme so defective that they have chronic hemolytic anemia; however, the most common type of defect only results in hemolysis when cells are under certain types of stress, associated with fever and certain types of medications. G-6-PD deficiency is one of the most common X-linked genetic blood disorders in the world, affecting more than 400 million people (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for discussion of X-linked disorders). However, women may also develop the disease because one of the X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell of the female embryo; thus, a female who is heterozygous for the deficiency would have one half normal red blood cells and one half with the deficiency. While the deficient cells are at risk for hemolysis, symptoms are generally milder in affected women because normal cells are not subject to hemolysis. In the United States, African Americans and people of Mediterranean descent are most likely to be affected with G-6-PD (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2111">Anderle, Bancone, Domingo, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The type of deficiency found in person with Mediterranean ancestry is typically more severe than that in African Americans; it results in more hemolysis and sometimes life-threatening hemolytic anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxidant drugs have hemolytic effects for people with G-6-PD deficiency, particularly some antibiotics including sulfadiazine, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and chloramphenicol, as well as antimalarial agents including chloroquine, primaquine, and dapsone. Other medications associated with hemolysis include phenazopyridine, rasburicase, methylthioninium, tolonium chloride, tamsulosin, glyburide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the street drug amyl nitrate (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2104">van Solinge &#x0026; van Wijk, 2016</a>). A severe hemolytic episode can also occur in affected people after ingesting fava beans, menthol, tonic water, and some Chinese herbs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1124">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are typically asymptomatic and have normal hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts. However, within several days after exposure to an offending agent, pallor, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria develop. The reticulocyte count increases, and symptoms of hemolysis develop. Special stains of peripheral blood often show Heinz bodies (degraded hemoglobin) within the erythrocytes. Hemolysis may be mild and self-limited; however, in more severe cases, usually in the Mediterranean type of the disease, spontaneous recovery does not occur.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1125">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis is made by a screening test for the deficiency or by quantitative assay of G-6-PD.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1126">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment requires discontinuation of the offending agent. Transfusion is not usually necessary unless severe hemolysis is present, as may be seen in the Mediterranean variety of G-6-PD deficiency.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1127">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients should be educated about the disease and provided with a list of medications and other substances to be avoided. Patients with G-6-PD deficiency should always seek medical advice before taking any new medication or supplement. The G-6-PD Deficiency organization Web site (see Resources) is an excellent source of information. If hemolysis occurs, nursing interventions are the same as for hemolysis with other conditions. Patients should be advised to wear Medic-Alert bracelets that identify that they have G-6-PD deficiency. Genetic counseling may also be indicated (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1128">Immune Hemolytic Anemias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Immune hemolytic anemias can result from exposure of erythrocytes to antibodies. Alloantibodies (antibodies against the host or &#x201C;self&#x201D;) occur as a result of immunization of a person to foreign antigens (e.g., the immunization of an Rh-negative person with Rh-positive blood). Alloantibodies tend to be of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) type and cause immediate destruction of sensitized erythrocytes either within the blood vessels (intravascular) or the liver. Hemolysis and anemia associated with hemolytic transfusion reaction is an example of alloimmune hemolytic anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Autoantibodies may develop for a number of reasons. In some circumstances, the person&#x2019;s immune system is dysfunctional and falsely identifies its own erythrocytes as foreign and produces antibodies against them. This may be seen in people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (see <a href="c30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page927" title="927"></span>Another cause of autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a deficiency of suppressor lymphocytes, which normally prevents antibody production against the patient&#x2019;s own antigens. Erythrocytes are then sequestered in the spleen and destroyed by macrophages outside of blood vessels (extravascular hemolysis) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Phillips &#x0026; Henderson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Autoimmune hemolytic anemias may be classified based on the body temperature involved when the antibodies react with the RBC antigen. Warm-body antibodies are the most common (80%) and bind to erythrocytes most actively in warm-body conditions (37&#x00B0;C [98.6&#x00B0;F]); cold-body antibodies react in cold conditions (0&#x00B0;C [32&#x00B0;F]) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Packman, 2016</a>). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with other disorders in most cases (e.g., medication exposure, lymphoma, CLL, other malignancies, collagen vascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, infection). In idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic states, the cause for antibody production is unknown. This primary form affects people of all ages and genders equally, while secondary forms occur more frequently in females and in people over the age of 45 years (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Packman, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1129">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical signs and symptoms vary and often reflect the severity of anemia. The hemolysis may range from very mild, with the patient&#x2019;s bone marrow able to compensate adequately with few or no symptoms, to severe, with life-threatening anemia. Most patients complain of fatigue and dizziness. Splenomegaly, with associated abdominal discomfort, is a common finding; hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice are also frequently seen.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1130">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Laboratory tests show a low hemoglobin level and hematocrit, usually associated with an elevated reticulocyte count. Erythrocytes appear abnormal; <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spherocytes:&lt;/b&gt; small, spherically shaped RBCs">spherocytes</button></strong> (small, spherically shaped erythrocytes) are often seen on the peripheral blood smear. The serum bilirubin level is elevated, and if the hemolysis is severe, the haptoglobin level is low or absent. The Coombs test (also known as the direct antiglobulin test), which detects antibodies on the surface of the erythrocytes, is typically positive.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1131">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Any possible contributing medication should be immediately discontinued. Treatment most often consists of high doses of corticosteroids until hemolysis decreases; this is especially beneficial when treating warm-antibody&#x2013;induced hemolysis (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Packman, 2016</a>). Corticosteroids have several actions including suppressing antibody production, reducing the affinity of antibodies for the erythrocytes, and reducing destruction of erythrocytes by macrophages in the spleen (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Go, Winters, &#x0026; Kay, 2017</a>). If the hemoglobin levels return to normal, often within a few weeks, the corticosteroid dose can be gradually reduced, and in some cases be tapered and eventually discontinued. However, treatment with corticosteroids does not produce lasting effects. In severe cases, transfusions with PRBCs are needed to maintain adequate levels of hemoglobin until the hemolytic process can be reduced. The antibodies may react to donor cells, making careful typing and cross matching essential. Transfusions are given slowly and cautiously with careful monitoring for transfusion reaction. Folic acid supplementation should be given when hemolysis is severe, because the bone marrow will attempt to compensate by increasing hematopoietic activity (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2139">Hill, Stamps, Massey, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If corticosteroids do not result in remission, splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be necessary to remove a major site of erythrocyte destruction. If neither corticosteroids nor splenectomy are successful, immunosuppressive medications may be given (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2139">Hill et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Immunosuppressive drugs used include cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. Cyclophosphamide has a rapid onset of action but is associated with significant toxicity. Azathioprine has a slower onset of action but less toxicity. Danazol, a synthetic androgen, may be beneficial for some patients, especially when used in combination with corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids must be tapered slowly over several months to avoid a flare of the immune system leading to an exacerbation of hemolysis. Monoclonal antibodies, including rituximab, can be effective in some patients and may offer long-term control of symptoms (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2139">Hill et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Cross-matching blood when antibodies are present can be difficult. If imperfectly cross-matched PRBCs must be transfused, the nurse should begin the infusion very slowly (10 to 15 mL over 20 to 30 minutes) and monitor the patient very carefully for signs and symptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">For patients with cold-antibody hemolytic anemia, no treatment may be needed, other than to advise the patient to keep warm. Relocation to a warmer climate may be advisable in some cases. In other situations, where hemolysis is more severe, more aggressive interventions as previously described may be needed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1132">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients may have difficulty understanding the complex nature of their illness and may need repeated explanations in terms they can understand. Patients who have had splenectomy should receive the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine and annual influenza vaccine and be informed that they are permanently at increased risk for infection. Patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, particularly those with diabetes or hypertension, need careful monitoring. They must understand the need for their medications and avoid abruptly discontinuing them. A written explanation and a tapering schedule should be provided, emphasizing adjustments based on hemoglobin levels. Similar information should be provided when immunosuppressive agents are used. Corticosteroid therapy is associated with risks and patients should be monitored frequently for complications (see <a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#tt45-3">Chapter 45, Table 45-3</a>, Corticosteroid therapy and implications for nursing practice).</p>
