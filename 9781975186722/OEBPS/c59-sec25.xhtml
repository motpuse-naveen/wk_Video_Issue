<h4 class="h4" id="s2907">Implanted Hearing Devices</h4>
<p class="nonindent">There are several types of implanted hearing devices, ranging from implantable to semi-implantable devices (FDA, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone conduction devices, which transmit sound through the skull to the inner ear, are used in patients with a conductive hearing loss if a hearing aid is contraindicated (e.g., those with chronic infection). The device is implanted postauricularly under the skin into the skull, and an external device&#x2014;worn above the ear, not in the canal&#x2014;transmits the sound through the skin. There are two types of implantable hearing aids. The bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is implanted behind the ear in the mastoid area. The middle ear implant (MEI) is implanted in the middle ear cavity. The BAHA is used for conductive or mixed hearing loss, whereas the MEI is used for sensorineural hearing loss (FDA, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">The implantable middle ear hearing device (IMEHD) comes in two styles: piezoelectric and electromagnetic, which are partially or totally implanted. Patients must be 18 years or older, must be diagnosed with mild to severe sensorineural loss, and must have tried other conventional devices with poor results to be considered candidates for this type of device. The implantable device has several advantages&#x2014;for example, it may eliminate feedback, achieve good cosmetic results, and allow the patient to perform most preferred leisure activities (e.g., dancing, swimming). Disadvantages are that this device is expensive, necessitates surgery, requires periodic recharging of batteries, and has unpredictable power output (FDA, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">The FDA has also approved the semi-implantable Vibrant Soundbridge (electromagnetic) and the total implantable Envoy Esteem (piezoelectric) devices. The Vibrant Soundbridge has an external device attached to the postauricular bone that transmits sound to the magnet in the middle ear that is attached to the long process of the incus. The magnet surrounds the long axis of the stapes, which in turn vibrates and sound is heard. The Envoy Esteem works similarly to the natural ear. The piezoelectric transducer is located at the head of the incus, which sends a signal that is amplified, filtered, and then converted back to a vibration signal. This vibration is delivered by the driver (piezoelectric transducer) and attached to the stapes capitulum; then, via the stapes bone, the inner ear receives the signal and is converted into a nerve impulse and translated into sound by the brain. The incus is removed prior to insertion of this device to prevent feedback from the sensor. Clinical trials reported that in best-fit aided conditions, speech reception thresholds improved from 41.2&#x00A0;dB to 29.4 dB and word recognition score at 50 dB hearing level improved from best-fit aided of 46.3% to 68.9% with the Envoy Esteem (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Kraus, Shohet, &#x0026; Catalano, 2011</a>). A 5-year follow-up study of the same group found that word recognition scores were improved by 17%; word recognition score at 50 dB hearing level improved in 49%, and remained the same in 41%; and speech reception threshold improved at every annual follow-up (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4247">Shohet, Kraus, Catalano, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A cochlear implant is an auditory prosthesis used for people with profound sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally who do not benefit from conventional hearing aids. The cochlear implant directly stimulates the auditory nerve and has made it possible for people who have severe hearing loss or who are deaf to hear sound (NIDCD, 2017a). The hearing loss may be congenital or acquired. An implant does not restore normal hearing; rather, it helps the person detect medium to loud environmental sounds and conversation. The implant provides stimulation directly to the auditory nerve, bypassing the nonfunctioning hair cells of the inner ear. The microphone and signal processor, worn outside the body, transmit electrical stimuli to the implanted electrodes. The electrical signals stimulate the auditory nerve fibers and then the brain, where they are interpreted.</p>
<p class="indent">Worldwide, more than 324,200 people have received cochlear implants. In the United States, approximately 58,000 adults and 38,000 children have received cochlear implants (NIDCD, 2017a). Studies report that older adult patients with cochlear implants experience improved understanding of speech and better cognition. Patients with cochlear implants were also noted to have more social interactions with others and improved quality of life. Research has reported that hearing improvement with a cochlear implant delays the occurrence as well as the progression of dementia (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4246">Sarant, Harris, Busby, et al., 2019</a>). Candidates for a cochlear implant, who are usually at least 1 year of age, are selected after careful screening by otologic history, physical examination, audiologic testing, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1961" title="1961"></span>x-rays, and psychological testing. Criteria for choosing adults who may benefit from a cochlear implant include:</p>

The internal coil has a stranded electrode lead. The electrode is inserted through the round window into the scala tympani of the cochlea. The external coil (the transmitter) is held in alignment with the internal coil (the receiver) by a magnet. The microphone receives the sound. The stimulator wire receives the signal after it has been filtered, adjusted, and modified so that the sound is at a comfortable level for the patient. Sound is passed by the external transmitter to the inner coil receiver by magnetic conduction and is then carried by the electrode to the cochlea.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears</li>
<li>Inability to hear and recognize speech well with hearing aids</li>
<li>No medical contraindication to a cochlear implant or general anesthesia</li>
<li>Indications that being able to hear would enhance the patient&#x2019;s life</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The surgery involves implanting a small receiver in the temporal bone through a postauricular incision and placing electrodes into the inner ear (see <a href="#ff59-7">Fig. 59-7</a>). The microphone and transmitter are worn on an external unit. The patient undergoes extensive cochlear rehabilitation with the multidisciplinary team, which includes an audiologist and speech pathologist. Several months may be needed to learn to interpret the sounds heard. Children and adults who lost their hearing before they learned to speak take much longer to acquire speech. There are wide variations of success with cochlear implants, and there is also controversy about their use, especially among the Deaf community. Patients who have had a cochlear implant are cautioned that an MRI scan will inactivate the implant; MRI should be used only when there is no other diagnostic option.</p>
