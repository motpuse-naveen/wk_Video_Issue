<h4 class="h4" id="s2862">Cerumen Impaction</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cerumen normally accumulates in the external canal in various amounts and colors. Although wax does not usually need to be removed, impaction occasionally occurs, causing <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;otalgia:&lt;/b&gt; sensation of fullness or pain in the ear">otalgia</button></strong> (a sensation of fullness or pain in the ear) with or without a hearing loss. Accumulation of cerumen as a cause of hearing loss is especially significant in older adult patients (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Attempts to clear the external auditory canal with matches, hairpins, and other implements are dangerous because trauma to the skin, infection, and damage to the tympanic membrane can occur.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2863">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cerumen can be removed by irrigation, suction, or instrumentation. Unless the patient has a perforated eardrum or an inflamed external ear (i.e., otitis externa), gentle irrigation with warm water usually helps remove impacted cerumen, particularly if it is not tightly packed in the external auditory canal. For successful removal, the water stream must flow behind the obstructing cerumen to move it first laterally and then out of the canal. To prevent injury, the lowest effective pressure should be used. However, if the eardrum behind the impaction is perforated, water can enter the middle ear, producing acute vertigo and infection. If irrigation is unsuccessful, direct visual, mechanical removal can be performed by a trained health care provider on a patient who is cooperative.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Warm water (never cold or hot) and gentle (not forceful) irrigation should be used to remove cerumen. Irrigation that is too forceful can cause perforation of the tympanic membrane, and ice water causes vomiting.</em></p></div>

<p class="indent">Instilling a few drops of warmed glycerin, mineral oil, or half-strength hydrogen peroxide into the ear canal for 30&#x00A0;minutes prior to irrigation can soften cerumen before its removal. Ceruminolytic agents, such as peroxide in glyceryl, are available. The use of any softening solution two or three times a day for several days is generally sufficient. If cerumen cannot be dislodged by these methods, instruments, such as a cerumen curette, aural suction, and a binocular microscope for magnification, can be used. The use of instruments such as a cerumen curette for cerumen removal is reserved for otolaryngologists and nurses with specialized training because of the danger of perforating the tympanic membrane or excoriating the external auditory canal.</p>
