<h4 class="h4" id="s1820">Hepatic Encephalopathy and Coma</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatic encephalopathy, or portosystemic encephalopathy, is a life-threatening complication of liver disease that occurs <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1381" title="1381"></span>with profound liver failure. Patients with this condition may have no overt signs of the illness but have abnormalities on neuropsychological testing (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3321">Yanny, Winters, Boutros, et al., 2019</a>). Hepatic encephalopathy is the neuropsychiatric manifestation of hepatic failure associated with portal hypertension and the shunting of blood from the portal venous system into the systemic circulation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>). This reversible metabolic form of encephalopathy can improve with recovery of liver function. The onset is often insidious and subtle, and initially the disease is termed <em>subclinical</em> or <em>minimal hepatic encephalopathy.</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1821">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Despite the frequency with which hepatic encephalopathy occurs, the precise pathophysiology is not fully understood (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>). Two major alterations underlie its development in acute and chronic liver disease. First, hepatic insufficiency may result in encephalopathy because of the inability of the liver to detoxify toxic by-products of metabolism. Second, portosystemic shunting, in which collateral vessels develop as a result of portal hypertension, allows elements of the portal blood (laden with potentially toxic substances usually extracted by the liver) to enter the systemic circulation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>). Ammonia is considered the major etiologic factor in the development of encephalopathy. Ammonia enters the brain and excites peripheral benzodiazepine-type receptors on astrocyte cells, increasing neurosteroid synthesis, and stimulating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. GABA causes depression of the central nervous system that inhibits neurotransmission and synaptic regulation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>), producing sleep and behavior patterns associated with hepatic encephalopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">Circumstances that increase serum ammonia levels tend to aggravate or precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The largest source of ammonia is the enzymatic and bacterial digestion of dietary and blood proteins in the GI tract. Ammonia from these sources increases as a result of GI bleeding (i.e., bleeding esophageal varices, chronic GI bleeding), a high-protein diet, bacterial infection, or uremia. The ingestion of ammonium salts also increases the blood ammonia level. In the presence of alkalosis or hypokalemia, increased amounts of ammonia are absorbed from the GI tract and from the renal tubular fluid. Conversely, serum ammonia is decreased by elimination of protein from the diet and by the administration of antibiotics, such as neomycin sulfate, which reduce the number of intestinal bacteria capable of converting urea to ammonia (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other factors unrelated to increased serum ammonia levels that can cause hepatic encephalopathy in susceptible patients include excessive diuresis, dehydration, infections, surgery, fever, and some medications (sedatives, tranquilizers, analgesics, and diuretics that cause potassium loss). Additional causes include elevated levels of serum manganese (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>), as well as changes in the types of circulating amino acids, mercaptans, and levels of dopamine and other neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). Mercaptans are toxic metabolites of sulfur-containing compounds that are excreted by the liver under normal conditions. Mercaptans and these other so-called &#x201C;false&#x201D; neurotransmitters may be generated from an intestinal source or from metabolism of protein by the liver and, with defective hepatic clearance, may precipitate encephalopathy.</p>

The patient is asked to hold the arm out with the handheld upward (dorsiflexed). Within a few seconds, the hand falls forward involuntarily and then quickly returns to the dorsiflexed position.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1822">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The earliest symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include mental status changes and motor disturbances. The patient appears confused and unkempt and has alterations in mood and sleep patterns. The patient tends to sleep during the day and has restlessness and insomnia at night. As hepatic encephalopathy progresses, the patient may become difficult to awaken and completely disoriented with respect to time and place. With further progression, the patient lapses into frank coma and may have seizures.</p>
<p class="indent">Asterixis, an involuntary flapping of the hands, may be seen in stage II encephalopathy (see <a href="#ff43-12">Fig. 43-12</a>). Simple tasks, such as handwriting, become difficult. A handwriting or drawing sample (e.g., star figure), taken daily, may provide graphic evidence of progression or reversal of hepatic encephalopathy. Inability to reproduce a simple figure in two or three dimensions (see <a href="#ff43-13">Fig. 43-13</a>) is referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;constructional apraxia:&lt;/b&gt; inability to draw figures in two or three dimensions">constructional apraxia</button></strong>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1382" title="1382"></span>In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy, the deep tendon reflexes are hyperactive; with worsening of the encephalopathy, these reflexes disappear and the extremities may become flaccid.</p>
<p class="indent">Occasionally, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fetor hepaticus:&lt;/b&gt; sweet, slightly fecal odor to the breath, presumed to be of intestinal origin">fetor hepaticus</button></strong>, a sweet, slightly fecal odor to the breath that is presumed to be of intestinal origin, may be noticed. The odor has also been described as similar to that of freshly mowed grass, acetone, or old wine. Fetor hepaticus is prevalent with extensive collateral portal circulation in chronic liver disease.</p>

Oxford, UK: John Wiley &#x0026; Sons.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1823">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several diagnostic algorithms and a variety of psychometric tests are used in determining the presence and severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The electroencephalogram shows generalized slowing, an increase in the amplitude of brain waves, and characteristic triphasic waves. The survival rate after a first episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis is approximately 40% at 1 year. Eligible patients should be referred for liver transplantation after this initial episode (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1824">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management focuses on identifying and eliminating the precipitating cause, if possible, initiating ammonia-lowering therapy, minimizing potential medical complications of cirrhosis and depressed consciousness, and reversing the underlying liver disease, if possible. Correction of the possible reasons for the deterioration such as bleeding, electrolyte abnormalities, sedation, or azotemia is essential. Lactulose is given to reduce serum ammonia levels. It acts by trapping and expelling the ammonia in the feces (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>). Two or three soft stools per day are desirable; this indicates that lactulose is performing as intended.</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The patient receiving lactulose is monitored closely for the development of watery diarrhea stools, because they indicate a medication overdose. Serum ammonia levels are closely monitored as well.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Possible side effects of lactulose include intestinal bloating and cramps, which usually disappear within a week. To mask the sweet taste, which some patients dislike, it can be diluted with fruit juice. The patient is closely monitored for hypokalemia and dehydration. Other laxatives are not prescribed during lactulose administration because their effects disturb dosage regulation. Lactulose may be given by nasogastric tube or enema for patients who are comatose or for those in whom oral administration is contraindicated or not possible (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other management strategies include IV administration of glucose to minimize protein breakdown, administration of vitamins to correct deficiencies, and correction of electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium). Antibiotics may also be added to the treatment regimen. Neomycin, metronidazole, and rifaximin have been used to reduce levels of ammonia-forming bacteria in the colon. However, no benefit has been shown for long-term treatment with these antibiotics (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>). Additional management strategies for hepatic encephalopathy include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Neurologic status is assessed frequently.</span></li>
<li><span>Mental status is monitored by keeping a daily record of handwriting and arithmetic performance.</span></li>
<li><span>I&#x0026;O and body weight are recorded each day.</span></li>
<li><span>Vital signs are measured and recorded every 4 hours.</span></li>
<li><span>Potential sites of infection (peritoneum, lungs) are assessed frequently, and abnormal findings are reported promptly.</span></li>
<li><span>Serum ammonia level is monitored daily.</span></li>
<li><span>Dietary protein intake should not be restricted in hepatic encephalopathy as recommended in the past. Protein intake should be maintained at 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/day (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3288">European Association for the Study of the Liver [EASL], 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Styskel, Natarajan, &#x0026; Kanwal, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3322">Yao, Fung, Chu, et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ct43-4">Chart 43-4</a>). The danger of protein malnutrition far outweighs the risk of worsening hepatic encephalopathy caused by increased protein intake (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Styskel et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yao et al., 2018</a>).</span></li>
<li><span>Enteral feeding is provided for patients whose encephalopathic state persists.</span></li>
<li><span>Reduction in the absorption of ammonia from the GI tract is accomplished by the use of gastric suction, enemas, or oral antibiotics.</span></li>
<li><span>Electrolyte status is monitored and corrected if abnormal.</span></li>
<li><span>Sedatives, tranquilizers, and analgesic medications are discontinued.</span></li>
<li><span>Benzodiazepine antagonists such as flumazenil may be administered IV to improve encephalopathy, whether or not the patient has previously taken benzodiazepines. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1383" title="1383"></span>This action may have short-term efficacy because patients with hepatic encephalopathy have an increased concentration of benzodiazepine receptors (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1825"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><a href="#tt43-3">Table 43-3</a> presents the stages of hepatic encephalopathy, common signs and symptoms, and potential nursing diagnoses for each stage. The nurse is responsible for maintaining a safe environment to prevent injury, bleeding, and infection. The nurse administers the prescribed treatments and monitors the patient for the numerous potential complications. The potential for respiratory compromise is great given the patient&#x2019;s depressed neurologic status. The nurse encourages deep breathing and position changes to prevent the development of atelectasis, pneumonia, and other respiratory complications. Despite aggressive pulmonary care, patients may develop respiratory compromise. They may require intubation and mechanical ventilation to protect the airway, and they are frequently admitted to the ICU.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse communicates with the patient&#x2019;s family to inform them about the patient&#x2019;s status and supports them by explaining the procedures and treatments that are part of the patient&#x2019;s care. If the patient recovers from hepatic encephalopathy and coma, rehabilitation is likely to be prolonged. Therefore, the patient and family will require assistance to understand the causes of this severe complication and to recognize that it may recur.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon21.png" alt=""/> <strong>Educating Patients About Self-Care</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient has recovered from hepatic encephalopathy and is to be discharged home, the nurse educates the family about subtle signs of recurrent encephalopathy. The goals for caloric intake and protein intake should be 35 to 40 kcal/kg body weight per day and 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg body weight per day (see <a href="#ct43-4">Chart 43-4</a>) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Styskel et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yao et al., 2018</a>). Protein intake should not be limited too severely, because doing so worsens nutritional status and increases mortality (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Styskel et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yanny et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yao et al., 2018</a>). Continued use of lactulose after discharge is not uncommon, and the patient and family should closely monitor its efficacy and side effects. They should also be cautioned that constipation can precipitate encephalopathy and may be prevented through the prescribed use of lactulose.</p>
<p class="h7"><strong>Continuing and Transitional Care</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Referral for transitional, home, or community-based care is warranted for the patient who returns home after recovery from hepatic encephalopathy. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and mental status and collaborates closely with the primary provider. The home visit provides an opportunity for the nurse to assess the home environment and the ability of the patient and family to monitor signs and symptoms and follow the treatment regimen. The nurse must evaluate the patient&#x2019;s fluid volume status and be alert for changes indicative of hypovolemia due to decreased intake and for decreased urine output associated with hepatorenal syndrome (see later discussion). Monitoring of laboratory values continues to be important, and the nurse must obtain prescriptions to correct abnormalities, especially electrolyte imbalances, which also can worsen encephalopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">The safety of the home environment is assessed closely to identify areas of risk for falls and other injuries. Home or transitional care visits are especially important if the patient lives alone because encephalopathy may affect the patient&#x2019;s ability to remember or follow the treatment regimen. The nurse reinforces previous education and reminds the patient and family about the importance of dietary restrictions, close monitoring, and follow-up. In addition, the nurse must observe the patient for subtle behavior changes of worsening hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with all types and stages of hepatic encephalopathy should have periodic neurologic evaluations to determine their cognitive function so that they do not engage in potentially harmful activities. Even subtle <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1384" title="1384"></span>neuropsychiatric abnormalities may preclude patients from driving, operating machinery, or participating in other activities that require psychomotor coordination.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients and families may need additional support during those times that the patient exhibits mood disturbances and sleep disorders. Patients should be as active as possible during the day and develop a normal sleep&#x2013;wake pattern. Sedating medications should be avoided because they may precipitate encephalopathy. Patients and families may require assistance in developing plans to cope with changes in mood and mental status changes. This plan should identify support persons to attend to the patient in the home if needed. Social workers and case managers may make appropriate referrals for assistance with physical and psychosocial support and care. Referrals to psychologists, psychiatric liaison nurses, case managers, social workers, or therapists may assist family members with coping. Spiritual advisors may also provide another outlet for communication and guidance. If alcohol played a role in the development of the liver disease and encephalopathy, referral to Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-Anon may provide needed support and education.</p>
