<p class="nonindent">Dermatologic disorders are encountered frequently by nurses across many practice settings. Nursing management of patients with dermatologic disorders can range from simple interventions such as administering topical and systemic medications for prevention to treating complex pressure injuries. The nurse can also be instrumental in educating patients how to care for their skin and provide self-care for wounds. The objectives of nursing interventions are to prevent additional skin and tissue damage, prevent secondary infection, reverse the inflammatory process, and relieve the symptoms.</p>
