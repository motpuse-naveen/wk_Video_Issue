<h4 class="h4" id="s2663">Dermatitis Herpetiformis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Dermatitis herpetiformis is an intensely pruritic, chronic disease that manifests with small, tense blisters that are distributed over the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees, as well as the buttocks and back. It most commonly occurs between 20 and 40 years of age but can appear at any age. It is more common in people of northern European heritage and is slightly more common in men. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have a defect in gluten metabolism; many have a concomitant diagnosis of celiac disease (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miller &#x0026; Zaman, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2664">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients typically present with erythematous papules with small, clustered (i.e., herpetiform) vesicles that tend to have a symmetrical distribution on affected extensor surfaces of the skin. Erosions and crusts may also be present, which may result from excoriation and scratching as a reaction to the intense pruritus (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miller &#x0026; Zaman, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Immunofluorescent studies of skin biopsy specimens from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis reveal granular patterns of IgA deposits in the papillary dermis (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miller &#x0026; Zaman, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2665">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients respond to dapsone and to a gluten-free diet. All patients should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because dapsone can induce severe hemolysis in those with this deficiency. Patients benefit from dietary counseling because the dietary restrictions are lifelong, and a gluten-free diet is often difficult to follow (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> for further discussion of gluten-free diets) (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miller &#x0026; Zaman, 2020</a>). Patients need emotional support as they deal with the process of learning new habits and accepting major changes in their lives.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients with blistering disorders may experience significant disability. There is constant itching and possible pain in the denuded areas of skin. There may be drainage from the denuded areas, which may be malodorous. Effective assessment and nursing management become a challenge.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Disease activity is monitored clinically by examining the skin for the appearance of new blisters. Particular attention is given to assessing for signs and symptoms of infection. Hyperpigmentation may be seen in areas of resolving blisters.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<span class="small">URSING</span> D<span class="small">IAGNOSES</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain of skin and oral cavity associated with blistering and erosions</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired skin integrity associated with ruptured bullae and denuded areas of the skin</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disturbed body image associated with the appearance of the skin</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for infection associated with loss of protective barrier of skin and mucous membranes</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hypovolemia associated with loss of tissue fluids</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include relief of discomfort from lesions, skin healing, improved body image, absence of infection, and achievement of fluid and electrolyte balance.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">ELIEVING</span> O<span class="small">RAL</span> D<span class="small">ISCOMFORT</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Depending on the skin disorder, the patient&#x2019;s entire oral cavity may be affected with erosions and denuded surfaces. Necrotic tissue may develop over these areas, adding to the patient&#x2019;s discomfort and interfering with eating. Weight loss and hypoproteinemia may result. Meticulous oral hygiene is important to keep the oral mucosa clean and allow the epithelium to regenerate. Frequent rinsing of the mouth with chlorhexidine solution is prescribed to rid the mouth of debris and to soothe ulcerated areas. Commercial mouthwashes are avoided. The lips are kept moist with petrolatum. Cool mist therapy helps humidify environmental air.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient with painful and extensive lesions should be premedicated with analgesic agents before skin care is initiated. Patients with large areas of blistering have a characteristic odor that decreases when secondary infection is controlled. After the patient&#x2019;s skin is bathed, it is dried carefully. Tape should never be used because it may produce more blisters. Hypothermia is common, and measures to keep the patient warm and comfortable are priority nursing activities. The nursing management of patients with bullous skin conditions can be similar to that for patients with extensive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1848" title="1848"></span>burns (see <a href="c57.xhtml">Chapter 57</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Attention to the psychological needs of the patient requires listening to the patient, being available, providing expert nursing care, and educating the patient and the family. The patient is encouraged to express anxieties, discomfort, and feelings of hopelessness. Arranging for a family member or a close friend to spend more time with the patient, either live or via distance technology, can be supportive. When patients receive information about the disease and its treatment, uncertainty and anxiety often decrease, and the patient&#x2019;s capacity to act on their own behalf is enhanced. Psychological counseling may assist the patient in dealing with fears, anxiety, and promote positive self-esteem.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">REVENTING</span> I<span class="small">NFECTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is susceptible to infection because the barrier function of the skin is compromised. Bullae are also susceptible to infection, and sepsis may follow (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). The skin is cleaned to remove debris and dead skin and to prevent infection.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Secondary infection may be accompanied by an unpleasant odor from skin or oral lesions. <em>Candida albicans</em> of the mouth (i.e., thrush) commonly affects patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. The oral cavity is inspected daily, and any changes are reported. Oral lesions are slow to heal.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Because infection is the leading cause of death in patients with blistering diseases, meticulous assessment for signs and symptoms of local and systemic infection is required. Seemingly trivial complaints or minimal changes are investigated because corticosteroids can mask or alter typical signs and symptoms of infection.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s vital signs are monitored, and temperature fluctuations are documented. The patient is observed for chills, and all secretions and excretions are monitored for changes suggesting infection. Results of culture and sensitivity tests are monitored. Antimicrobial agents are given as prescribed, and response to treatment is assessed. Health care personnel must perform effective hand hygiene and wear gloves.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In patients who are hospitalized, environmental contamination is reduced as much as possible. Isolation measures, standard precautions, and the use of appropriate PPE are warranted. See <a href="c32.xhtml">Chapter 32</a>, <a href="c32-sec01.xhtml#ct32-5">Chart 32-5</a> for a description of standard precautions.</p>

<p class="processppara">Extensive denudation of the skin leads to fluid and electrolyte imbalance because of significant loss of fluids and sodium chloride from the skin. This sodium chloride loss is responsible for many of the systemic symptoms associated with the disease and is treated by IV administration of saline solution.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A large amount of protein and blood is also lost from the denuded skin areas. Blood component therapy may be prescribed to maintain the blood volume, hemoglobin level, and plasma protein concentration. Serum albumin, protein, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values are monitored.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is encouraged to maintain adequate oral fluid intake. Cool, nonirritating fluids are encouraged to maintain hydration. Small, frequent meals or snacks of high-protein, high-calorie foods (e.g., oral nutritional supplements, eggnog, milk shakes) help maintain nutritional status. Parenteral nutrition is considered if the patient cannot eat an adequate diet.</p>
