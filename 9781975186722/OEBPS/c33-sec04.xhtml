<h4 class="h4" id="s1305">Anaphylaxis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Anaphylaxis is a clinical response to an immediate (type I hypersensitivity) immunologic reaction between a specific antigen and an antibody. The reaction results from a rapid release of IgE-mediated chemicals, which can induce a severe, life-threatening reaction (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1306">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anaphylaxis is a type I IgE allergic reaction to an antigen, a foreign substance that has entered the body. It is caused by the cross-links of an allergen with allergen-specific IgE antibodies found on the surface membrane of mast cells and basophils, leading to cellular degranulation. The subsequent release of histamine and other bioactive mediators causes activation of platelets, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Histamine, prostaglandins, and inflammatory leukotrienes are potent vasoactive mediators that are implicated in the vascular permeability changes, flushing, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urticaria:&lt;/b&gt; a round, reddened skin elevation or hives">urticaria</button></strong> (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and bronchoconstriction that characterize anaphylaxis. Smooth muscle spasm, bronchospasm, mucosal edema and inflammation, and increased capillary permeability result. Symptoms of anaphylaxis are sudden in onset and progress in severity over minutes to hours (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kemp, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Closely resembling anaphylaxis is an anaphylactoid reaction, which is caused by the release of mast cell and basophil mediators triggered by non&#x2013;immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated events. This nonallergenic anaphylaxis reaction may occur with medications, food, exercise, or cytotoxic antibody transfusions. The reaction may be local or systemic. Local reactions usually involve urticaria and angioedema at the site of the antigen exposure. Although possibly severe, nonallergenic anaphylaxis reactions are rarely fatal. Systemic reactions occur within about 30 minutes after exposure and involve cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and integumentary organ systems. For the most part, the treatment of nonallergenic anaphylaxis reaction is identical to that of anaphylaxis (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Campbell &#x0026; Kelso, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Common causes of anaphylaxis are listed in <a href="#ct33-2">Chart 33-2</a>. Antibiotics and radiocontrast agents cause the most serious anaphylactic reactions. Penicillin is the most common medication to cause anaphylaxis. Approximately 10% of the population report having an allergy to penicillin. However, less than 5% have clinically significant IgE or T cell&#x2013;mediated penicillin allergy (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2440">Shenoy, Macy, Rowe, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1307">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anaphylactic reactions produce a clinical syndrome that affects multiple organ systems. Reactions may be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. The time from the exposure to the antigen to the onset of symptoms is a good indicator of the severity of the reaction&#x2014;the faster the onset, the more severe the reaction. The severity of previous reactions does not determine the severity of subsequent reactions, which could be the same or more or less severe. The severity depends on the degree of allergy and the dose of allergen exposure (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Mild systemic reactions consist of peripheral tingling and a sensation of warmth, possibly accompanied by a sensation of fullness in the mouth and throat. Nasal congestion, periorbital swelling, pruritus, sneezing, and tearing of the eyes can also be expected. The onset of symptoms begins within the first 2 hours after the exposure.</p>
<p class="indent">Moderate systemic reactions may include flushing, warmth, anxiety, and itching in addition to any of the milder symptoms. More serious reactions include bronchospasm and edema of the airways or larynx with dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. The onset of symptoms is the same as for a mild reaction (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Kemp, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Severe systemic reactions have an abrupt onset with the same signs and symptoms described previously. These symptoms progress rapidly to bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, severe dyspnea, cyanosis, and hypotension. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, and seizures can also occur. Cardiac arrest and coma may follow. Severe reactions are also referred to as anaphylactic shock (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1308">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Strict avoidance of potential allergens is an important preventive measure for the patient at risk for anaphylaxis. Those at risk for anaphylaxis from insect stings should avoid areas populated by insects and should use appropriate clothing, insect repellent, and caution to avoid further stings.</p>
<p class="indent">If avoidance of exposure to allergens is impossible, an autoinjector system for epinephrine will be prescribed. The patient should be instructed to carry and administer epinephrine to prevent an anaphylactic reaction in the event of exposure to the allergen. People who are sensitive to insect bites and stings, those who have experienced food or medication reactions, and those who have experienced idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylactic reactions should always carry an emergency kit that contains epinephrine. Autoinjection devices are commercially available for first aid and deliver premeasured doses of epinephrine (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The autoinjector system requires no preparation, and the self-administration technique is not complicated. The patient must be given an opportunity to demonstrate the correct technique for use; a training device can be used for educating about the correct technique. Verbal and written information about the emergency kit, as well as strategies to avoid exposure to threatening allergens, must also be provided (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Campbell &#x0026; Kelso, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Screening for allergies before a medication is prescribed or first administered is an important preventive measure. A careful history of any sensitivity to suspected antigens must be obtained before administering any medication, particularly in parenteral form, because this route is associated with the most severe anaphylaxis. Nurses caring for patients in any setting (hospital, home, outpatient diagnostic testing sites, long-term care facilities) must assess patients&#x2019; risks for anaphylactic reactions. Patients are asked about previous exposure to contrast agents used for diagnostic tests and any allergic reactions, as well as reactions to any medications, foods, insect stings, and latex. People who are predisposed to anaphylaxis should wear medical identification such as a bracelet or necklace, which identifies allergies to medications, food, and other substances.</p>
<p class="indent">People who are allergic to insect venom may require venom immunotherapy, which is used as a control measure and not a cure. The most common serious allergic reactions to insect stings are from the Hymenoptera family, which includes bees, ants, wasps, and yellow jackets (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Warrell, 2019</a>). Venom immunotherapy is an effective treatment for people with systemic reactions to an insect sting. It reduces the systemic reaction, reduces the risk of future large local reactions, and improves quality of life (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Larsen, Broge, &#x0026; Jacobi, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with diabetes who are allergic to insulin and those who are allergic to penicillin may require desensitization. Desensitization is based on controlled anaphylaxis, with a gradual release of mediators. Patients who undergo desensitization are cautioned to avoid lapses in therapy, because this may lead to the reappearance of the allergic reaction when the use of the medication is resumed (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells &#x0026; Solensky, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1309">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management depends on the severity of the reaction. Initially, respiratory and cardiovascular functions are evaluated. If the patient is in cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is instituted (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Campbell &#x0026; Kelso, 2018</a>). Supplemental oxygen is provided during CPR or if the patient is cyanotic, dyspneic, or wheezing. Epinephrine, in a 1:1000 dilution, is given subcutaneously in the upper extremity or thigh and may be followed by a continuous intravenous infusion. Most adverse events associated with administration of epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) occur when the dose is excessive or is given intravenously. Patients at risk for adverse effects include older patients and those with hypertension, arteriopathies, or known ischemic heart disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Antihistamines and corticosteroids should not be given in place of epinephrine. However, they may also be given as adjunct therapy (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Campbell &#x0026; Kelso, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Intravenous fluids (e.g., normal saline solution), volume expanders, and vasopressor agents are given to maintain blood pressure and normal hemodynamic status. In patients with episodes of bronchospasm or a history of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aminophylline and corticosteroids may also be given to improve airway patency and function. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for management of anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have experienced anaphylactic reactions and received epinephrine should be transported to the local emergency department (ED) for observation and monitoring because of the risk for a &#x201C;rebound&#x201D; or delayed reaction 4 to 8 hours after the initial allergic reaction. However, the observation time should be individualized based on the severity of the anaphylaxis. Longer periods of observation should be considered for patients who ingested the allergen, required more than one dose of epinephrine, had hypotension or pharyngeal edema, or have a history of asthma (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Lieberman, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1310">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If a patient is experiencing an allergic response, the nurse assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Airway, breathing pattern, and vital signs are assessed. The patient is observed for signs of increasing edema and respiratory distress. Prompt notification of the rapid response team, the provider, or both is required. Rapid initiation of emergency measures (e.g., intubation, administration of emergency medications, insertion of intravenous lines, fluid administration, and oxygen administration) is important to reduce the severity of the reaction and to restore cardiovascular function. The nurse documents the interventions used and the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and response to treatment (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Campbell &#x0026; Kelso, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who has recovered from anaphylaxis needs to be educated about what occurred, how to avoid future exposure to antigens, and how to administer emergency medications to treat anaphylaxis. The nurse assesses the health literacy level of the patient and determines the best method of providing discharge instructions (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2454">Wilkin, 2020</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct33-3">Chart 33-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction should receive a prescription for an autoinjectable epinephrine device. The nurse educates the patient and family in their use and has the patient and family return demonstrate correct administration (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Moore, Kemp, &#x0026; Kemp, 2015</a>) (see <a href="#ct33-4">Chart 33-4</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Using Video Discharge Instructions</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Wilkin, Z. L. (2020). Effects of video discharge instructions on patient understanding. <em>Advanced Emergency Nursing Journal</em>, <em>42</em>(1), 71&#x2013;78.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients have difficulty understanding and retaining education at the time of discharge, particularly if instructions are given only in the form of printed materials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of using video discharge instructions on patient understanding of the education provided upon discharge from an emergency department (ED).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial that used a convenience sample of patients admitted to the ED. Participants were randomized to receive either standard discharge procedures, or standard discharge procedures plus video discharge instructions. Ten minutes after receiving one of the education methods, participants were tested with a 5-question multiple choice test.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants included 60 adults with a mean age of 37 years, and with a medical diagnosis of either upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, or gastroenteritis. Thirty participants received the video discharge instructions, while the other 30 received the standard discharge procedure. There was a significant difference in knowledge level, with those receiving the video instructions having a higher level of knowledge (4.53 vs. 4, <em>p</em> = 0.009) on the multiple choice test.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study provides evidence that video discharge instructions have the potential to increase the knowledge level of patients receiving discharge education. Nurses who work in busy settings, such as EDs, should consider developing supplemental materials to augment standard written discharge instructions to help increase patients&#x2019; understanding and retention of important information.</p>
