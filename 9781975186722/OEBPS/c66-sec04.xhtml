<h4 class="h4" id="s3137">Diarrheal Diseases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Worldwide, diarrheal diseases are a significant cause of mortality, especially for children (CDC, 2020j). In the United States, the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases changes continually. Water disinfection, pasteurization, and appropriate food packaging have decreased the incidence of diseases such as typhoid and cholera. However, importation of foreign foods, environmental and ecologic changes, and changes in diagnostic test modalities have led to recognition of new trends and outbreaks.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3138">Transmission</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The portal of entry of diarrheal pathogens is oral ingestion. Although food is far from sterile, the high acidity of the stomach and the antibody-producing cells of the small bowel generally decrease the potential of pathogens. Infection can occur when the infectious dose is high enough or if the acidic digestive environment is neutralized. Decreased gastric acidity with disruption of normal bowel flora (as occurs after surgery), the use of antimicrobial agents, and other causes of immune suppression decrease intestinal defenses.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3139">Causes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are many viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes of diarrheal diseases. The most significant viral cause of diarrhea is the <em>Calicivirus</em> (often called <em>Norovirus</em>, a virus associated with outbreaks in long-term care facilities and cruise ships) (CDC, 2020k). Common causes of bacterial infection include <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2161" title="2161"></span><em>Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella,</em> and <em>E. coli</em>. A common parasitic infection of importance is <em>Giardia.</em> Diarrheal disease may also be caused by <em>Vibrio cholera</em>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Calicivirus (Norovirus)</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Calicivirus,</em> which is often referred to as the <em>Norovirus,</em> is the most common cause of foodborne illness and gastroenteritis in the United States. Onset of illness is usually acute, with vomiting and watery diarrhea that generally last for approximately 2 days. Most outbreaks occur between November and April. Dehydration is the most common complication. <em>Calicivirus</em> has been associated with large diarrheal outbreaks in schools, day care centers, cruise ships, long-term care facilities, and hospitals (CDC, 2020k).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Calicivirus</em> is transmitted easily from person to person by direct contact and by ingesting contaminated food. Waterborne outbreaks have been associated with sewage-contaminated wells and contaminated swimming pools. Although people with <em>Calicivirus</em> infection typically recover within 2 to 3 days, they may continue to transmit the virus to others for approximately 2 more weeks (CDC, 2020k).</p>
<p class="indent">Caliciviruses can withstand environmental extremes of heat or cold and are resistant to chemical disinfection, which are significant reasons for their epidemic potential. Control of <em>Calicivirus</em> in health care facilities requires a coordinated program to make decisions about isolation, environmental disinfection diagnosis method, and coordination with public health officials. Contact precautions should be used when caring for patients with incontinence and during outbreaks of the virus. Workers should wear masks if they are cleaning heavily soiled areas or caring for a patient who is actively vomiting. The CDC recommends disinfecting surfaces with a freshly prepared bleach solution, with 5 to 25 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water, or other product that is approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for <em>Norovirus</em> disinfection (CDC, 2020k).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Campylobacter Infections</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Campylobacter</em> species are frequent causes of diarrheal disease in the United States (CDC, 2020l). The bacterium, which is abundant in animal foods, is especially common in poultry but can also be found in beef and pork. Direct person-to-person transmission appears to be less common than it is for other enteric pathogens, such as <em>Shigella.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Cooking and storing food at appropriate temperatures protect against <em>Campylobacter</em> infection. Kitchen utensils used in meat preparation must be kept away from other food to prevent transmission from <em>Campylobacter</em> and other foodborne organisms (CDC, 2020l).</p>
<p class="indent">After a person is infected, the bacterium directly attacks the lumen of the intestine and may cause disease through enterotoxin release. Symptoms can range from mild abdominal cramping and minimal diarrhea to severe disease with profuse watery bloody diarrhea and debilitating abdominal cramping. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended only for patients who are seriously ill (CDC, 2020l).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><em>Salmonella</em> Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Salmonella</em> is a gram-negative bacillus with many species, including the very pathogenic <em>Salmonella typhi</em> (cause of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2166" title="2166"></span>typhoid fever). Of the nontyphi species, most organisms are prevalent in animal food sources, especially eggs and chicken. However, the bacteria also can contaminate other meats, nuts, produce, and processed foods (CDC, 2020m).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Salmonella</em> infections produce variable symptoms, including an asymptomatic carrier state, gastroenteritis, and systemic infection. Diarrhea with gastroenteritis is common. Disseminated disease and bacteremia, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, occur less often.</p>
<p class="indent">The person with <em>Salmonella</em>-caused diarrhea will seldom transmit infections to others. Hand hygiene is imperative after any contact with a person with <em>Salmonella</em> diarrhea. Although patients with systemic salmonellosis require antimicrobial therapy, those with gastroenteritis only are not usually treated, because antibiotic use may increase the period of time that the patient carries the bacteria while not improving the clinical outcome.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><em>Shigella</em> Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Shigella</em> species are gram-negative organisms that invade the lumen of the intestine and can cause severe watery (sometimes bloody) diarrhea and disseminated disease. <em>Shigella</em> species are spread through the fecal&#x2013;oral route, with easy transmission from one person to another. <em>Shigella</em> exhibits a high level of virulence, as infection with very few bacteria can cause disease. Because transmission occurs easily with improper hygiene, it is not surprising that <em>Shigella</em> organisms disproportionately affect pediatric populations. Disease in the very young may infrequently be complicated by pulmonary or neurologic symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Antimicrobial therapy should be instituted early. Frequently, initial therapy choices must be altered when final microbiologic testing reveals the organism&#x2019;s sensitivity (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4624">Williams &#x0026; Berkley, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Escherichia coli</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>E. coli</em> is the most common aerobic organism colonizing the large bowel. When <em>E. coli</em> bacteria are cultured from fecal specimens, the results usually reflect normal flora. However, certain strains of <em>E. coli</em> with increased virulence have been responsible for significant outbreaks of diarrheal disease in recent years. These more pathologic strains are subgrouped as Shiga toxin&#x2013;producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC) because of their production of enterotoxins. STEC strains often cause choleralike disease, with rapid, severe dehydration and an increased risk of death.</p>
<p class="indent">Several outbreaks of STEC have been linked to the ingestion of undercooked beef and to vegetables that have been contaminated by animal wastewater (<a href="c66-sec07.xhtml#bib4603">Shane, Mody, Crump, et al., 2017</a>). This bacterium lives in the intestines of cattle and can be introduced into meat at the time of slaughter. Prevention of disease from STEC strains is aimed at educating the public to wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, to separate foods during preparation, and to use a food thermometer to assure meat has been cooked thoroughly (CDC, 2020n).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Giardia lamblia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Transmission of the protozoan <em>Giardia lamblia</em> occurs when food or drink is contaminated with viable cysts of the organism. People often become infected while traveling to endemic areas or by drinking contaminated water from mountain streams within the United States. The organism can be transmitted by close contact, such as occurs in day care settings. Transmission by sexual contact has also been documented.</p>
<p class="indent">Frequently, the infection goes unnoticed. Infection is often recognized more easily in children than in adults. In extreme cases, the patient may experience abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea, usually described as containing mucus and fat but not blood. Microscopic examination of stool specimens reveals the trophozoite or cyst stages of the parasitic life cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">The CDC recommends metronidazole to treat <em>Giardia</em> (CDC, 2020o). Patients with <em>Giardia</em> infections should be instructed that the organism can be easily transmitted in family or group settings. Personal hygiene measures should be reinforced, and those who travel or camp where water is not treated and filtered should be advised to avoid local water supplies unless water is purified before drinking or using it in cooking.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vibrio Cholerae</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cholera is rare in the United States but remains a significant infectious cause of death worldwide. The causative organism is transmitted by contaminated food or water. Cases in the United States have been from contaminated shellfish found in the Gulf of Mexico or from contaminated shellfish brought into the United States by visitors. Cholera causes disease with a very rapid onset of copious diarrhea in which up to 1 L of fluid per hour can be lost. Dehydration, with subsequent cardiopulmonary collapse, may cause rapid progression from onset of signs and symptoms to death. Rehydration efforts should be vigorous and sustained. If oral rehydration cannot be accomplished, the patient may need IV fluid replacement (CDC, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Cholera should be suspected in patients who have watery diarrhea after eating shellfish harvested from the Gulf of Mexico. Confirmation of the causative organism can be made by stool culture. It is imperative that all cases are reported to local and state public health authorities.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The most important element of assessment in the patient with diarrhea is to determine hydration status. The goal of rehydration is to correct the dehydration. Assessment includes evaluation for thirst, dryness of oral mucous membranes, sunken eyes, a weakened pulse, and loss of skin turgor. Careful observation for these signs is especially important in cases of rapidly dehydrating diseases (most notably cholera) and in younger children.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Intake and output measurements are crucial in determining fluid balance. Liquid stool should be measured and recorded, along with the frequency of stools. It is important to note the consistency and appearance of stool as key indicators of the type and severity of the diarrheal disease. The presence of mucus or blood should also be documented.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When conducting a health history, the nurse asks the patient what they have eaten recently and about recent travel, treatment with antibiotics, and potential exposure to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2167" title="2167"></span>others with diarrheal disease. Frequently, patients attribute symptoms to the most recent meal eaten. However, because the incubation period for most diarrheal conditions is longer than the time interval between meals, the nurse must obtain detailed information about the meal preceding the illness as well as all food intake in the previous 3 to 4 days. When eliciting this kind of history, it is helpful to ask the patient to list every food tasted. The nurse also asks if the patient is employed in a food preparation service, because the local public health departments should be notified about any person with infectious diarrhea who works in the food industry.</p>

<p class="processppara">The patient is assessed to determine the degree of dehydration and the amount and route of rehydration needed. Oral rehydration therapy is a strategy used to reduce the severe complications of diarrheal disease regardless of causative agent. It is inexpensive and effective for most patients, but it is often underused due to some cultural beliefs worldwide discouraging oral intake during episodes of diarrhea. The WHO and the United Nations Children&#x2019;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) recommend zinc replacement and oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution for the treatment of children and adults with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance associated with cholera and other forms of diarrheal disease. Commercial ORS preparations are available and should be mixed with clean, safe water. When the ORS preparations are not available, salted vegetable soup or chicken soup can be used for fluid replacement. The ORS formula contains (in grams per liter) (CDC, 2018):</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>sodium chloride: 2.6</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>glucose (anhydrous): 13.5</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>potassium chloride: 1.5</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>trisodium citrate (dihydrate): 2.9</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The most important consideration is to provide more fluid than normal. Sports drinks do not replace fluid losses correctly and should not be used, unless they are the only fluid that is available or tolerated (CDC, 2018).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="pr_head">Mild Dehydration.</span> The patient exhibits dry oral mucous membranes of the mouth and increased thirst. The rehydration goal at this level of dehydration is to deliver about 50 mL of ORS per 1 kg of weight over a 4-hour interval (CDC, 2018).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="pr_head">Moderate Dehydration.</span> Common findings are sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, increased thirst, and dry oral mucous membranes. The rehydration goal at this level of dehydration is to deliver about 100 mL/kg of ORS over 4 hours.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="pr_head">Severe Dehydration.</span> The patient with severe dehydration shows signs of shock (i.e., rapid thready pulse, cyanosis, cold extremities, rapid breathing, lethargy, or coma; see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>) and should receive IV replacement until hemodynamic and mental status return to normal. When improvement is evident, the patient can be treated with ORS.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<span class="smallcaps">DMINISTERING</span> R<span class="smallcaps">EHYDRATION</span> T<span class="smallcaps">HERAPY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because diarrheal episodes are often accompanied by vomiting, rehydration and refeeding can be difficult. Oral rehydration therapy should be delivered frequently in small amounts. When patients are persistently vomiting, they often require frequent administration of fluids by spoonfuls. IV therapy is necessary for the patient who is severely dehydrated or in shock.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">It is important for children and adults with acute diarrheal symptoms to maintain caloric intake. As soon as dehydration has been corrected, an age-appropriate, unrestricted diet is allowed. Recommended foods include starches, cereals, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. Foods that are high in simple sugars, such as undiluted apple juice or gelatin, should be avoided (CDC, 2018).</p>

<p class="processppara">Public health nurses, school nurses, and others who are involved in patient education should emphasize principles of safe food preparation, with special attention to meat, poultry, and fish preparation and cooking as follows (CDC, 2020p):</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Fish and whole cuts of meat must reach a temperature of 145&#x00B0;F (63&#x00B0;C).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ground meat must reach 160&#x00B0;F (71&#x00B0;C).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Leftovers and poultry (both ground or whole cut) must reach 165&#x00B0;F (74&#x00B0;C).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before and after food preparation, all food should be maintained at temperatures below 40&#x00B0;F (5&#x00B0;C) or above 140&#x00B0;F (60&#x00B0;C).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In planning events that involve food preparation for groups of people, it is important to ensure adequate provision for proper storage and reheating to temperature thresholds. It is also important to use different surfaces, knives, and other equipment for raw meat, poultry, and fish and to keep these items separate from other foods.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Diarrheal diseases discussed in this section must be reported to local or state health departments. The goal of reporting is to provide information for determining incidence trends and promptly identifying any restaurants or other food preparation establishments that may have served contaminated food.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In both homes and health care delivery settings, good hygiene and principles of standard precautions should be emphasized.</p>
