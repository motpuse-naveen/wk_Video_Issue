<h4 class="h4" id="s2408">Cancer of the Fallopian Tubes</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Malignancies of the fallopian tube are the least common type of genital cancer (ACS, 2019a). Although this type of cancer can occur at any age, it is most common in women who are postmenopausal. Symptoms are often minimal, causing diagnosis to be made at an advanced stage (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Symptoms include abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding, and vaginal discharge. An enlarged fallopian tube may be found on sonogram if dilated and fluid filled, or it may appear or be palpated as a mass. Surgery followed by radiation therapy is the usual treatment.</p>
