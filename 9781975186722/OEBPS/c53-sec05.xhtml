<h4 class="h4" id="s2509">Disorders of Ejaculation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Premature ejaculation is defined as the occurrence of ejaculation sooner than desired, either before or shortly after penetration, causing distress to either one or both partners. It is one of the most common complaints of men or couples, affecting 20% to 30% of men (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Smith et al., 2019</a>). The spectrum of responses ranges from occasional ejaculation with penile-vaginal intercourse or self-stimulation to complete inability to ejaculate under any circumstances. Various forms have been identified including lifelong premature ejaculation caused by neurobiologic or genetic conditions, acquired (medical or psychological), natural variable (normal variation), and premature like ejaculatory dysfunction (psychological). In young men aged 18 to 25 years, factors associated with premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction include smoking, use of illegal drugs or medications without prescriptions, poor physical and mental health, lack of physical activity, and lack of sexual experience (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3849">Barbonetti, D&#x2019;Andrea, Cavallo, et al., 2019</a>). Other ejaculatory problems may include inhibited (delayed or retarded) ejaculation, which is the involuntary inhibition of the ejaculatory reflex (see <a href="#ct53-2">Chart&#x00A0;53-2</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;retrograde ejaculation:&lt;/b&gt; during ejaculation, semen travels to the urinary bladder instead of exiting through the penis">Retrograde ejaculation</button></strong> occurs when semen travels toward the bladder instead of exiting through the penis, resulting in infertility. This form of premature ejaculation may occur after prior prostate or urethral surgery, with diabetes, or with the use of medications such as antihypertensive agents.</p>

<p class="indent">Evaluation of premature ejaculation involves a thorough sexual history focusing on the duration of symptoms, time to ejaculation, degree of voluntary control over ejaculation, frequency of occurrence, and course of the problem since the first sexual encounter (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Smith et al., 2019</a>). Treatment, which depends on the nature, severity, and perceived distress that it causes, includes behavioral and psychological approaches, as well as pharmacologic therapy that attempts to alter the sensory input or retard the ejaculatory response. Behavioral therapy (e.g., counseling, sex therapy, psychoeducation, and couples therapy) often involves both the man and his sexual partner. The couple is encouraged to identify their sexual needs and to communicate those needs to each other. Pharmacologic management involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dapoxetine, alpha<sub>1</sub> adrenoceptor antagonists, the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and topical anesthetic agents. In some cases, a combination of pharmacologic and behavioral therapy may be effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Inhibited ejaculation is most often caused by psychological factors, neurologic disorders (e.g., SCI, multiple sclerosis, neuropathy secondary to diabetes), surgery (prostatectomy), and medications. Chemical, vibratory, and electrical methods of stimulation have been used with some success. Treatment usually addresses the physical and psychological factors involved in inhibited ejaculation (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Bartlik, Espinosa, &#x0026; Mindes, 2019</a>). Although outpatient therapy may involve numerous sessions (12 to 18), it often results in a success rate of 70% to 80%. The outcome depends on a previous satisfying sexual experience history, a short duration of the ejaculatory problem, communication about feelings of sexual desire and attraction to one&#x2019;s sexual partner, motivation for treatment, and absence of serious psychological problems.</p>
<p class="indent">For men with retrograde ejaculation, the urine may be collected shortly after ejaculation, revealing a large amount of sperm in the urine. This urine may also be collected to obtain adequate viable sperm for use in artificial insemination. In men with SCI, techniques that may be used to obtain sperm for artificial insemination include self-stimulation, vibratory stimulation, or electroejaculation. Electroejaculation involves the use of a specially designed probe that is inserted into the rectum next to the prostate. The probe delivers a current that stimulates the nerves and produces contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. However, spontaneous or stimulated ejaculation may cause autonomic dysreflexia (overstimulation of the autonomic nervous system) in patients with SCI at T6 or higher, creating a life-threatening situation (see <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>). If this disorder is not treated promptly, it may lead to seizures, stroke, and even death.</p>
