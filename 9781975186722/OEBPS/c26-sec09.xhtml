<h4 class="h4" id="s983">Aneurysms</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An aneurysm is a localized sac or dilation formed at a weak point in the wall of the artery (see <a href="#ff26-11">Fig. 26-11</a>). It may be classified by its shape or form. The most common forms of aneurysms are saccular and fusiform. A saccular aneurysm projects from only one side of the vessel. If an entire arterial segment becomes dilated, a fusiform aneurysm develops. Very small aneurysms due to localized infection are called <em>mycotic aneurysms.</em></p>

<h6 class="h6" id="s3312">Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 70% of all cases of thoracic aortic aneurysm are caused by atherosclerosis. They occur most frequently in men between the ages of 50 and 70 years, and are estimated to affect 10 of every 100,000 older adults. The thoracic area is the most common site for a dissecting aneurysm. Thoracic aortic emergencies are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, but with the emergence of endovascular aortic repair there is an improvement in the mortality rate; in particular, the mortality rate for patients treated at high-volume aortic centers can be as low as 4.8% (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1935">Harris, Olson, Panthofer, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s984">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms vary and depend on how rapidly the aneurysm dilates and how the pulsating mass affects surrounding intrathoracic structures. Some patients are asymptomatic. In most cases, pain is the most prominent symptom. The pain is usually constant and boring but may occur only when the person is supine. Other conspicuous symptoms are dyspnea, the result of pressure of the aneurysm sac against the trachea, a main bronchus, or the lung itself; cough, frequently paroxysmal and with a brassy quality; hoarseness, stridor, or vocal weakness or aphonia (complete loss of the voice), resulting from pressure against the laryngeal nerve; and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) due to impingement on the esophagus by the aneurysm.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s985">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When large veins in the chest are compressed by the aneurysm, the superficial veins of the chest, neck, or arms become dilated, and edematous areas on the chest wall and cyanosis are often evident. Pressure against the cervical sympathetic chain can result in unequal pupils. Diagnosis of a thoracic aortic aneurysm is principally made by chest x-ray, computed tomography angiography (CTA), MRA, or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). CTAs are typically performed because they are widely available, can be completed rapidly, and can remove cardiac motion artifacts, enhancing their accuracy (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s986">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment is based on whether the patient is symptomatic and whether the aneurysm is expanding in size, caused by an iatrogenic injury, contains a dissection, or involves branch vessels. General measures such as controlling blood pressure and correcting risk factors are helpful. For decades, beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol, metoprolol, carvedilol) have been the mainstay of medical treatment for aortic aneurysms; however, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (e.g., losartan, valsartan, irbesartan) may also retard aortic dilation (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1960">Rurali, Perrucci, Pilato, et al., 2018</a>). It is also important to control blood pressure in patients with dissecting aneurysms. Preoperatively, the systolic pressure is maintained at approximately 90 to 120 mm Hg in order to maintain a mean arterial pressure at 65 to 75 mm Hg with a beta-blocker such as esmolol or metoprolol. Occasionally, antihypertensive agents such as hydralazine are used for this purpose. Sodium nitroprusside is the most established drug used for this purpose; it is given by continuous IV drip to emergently lower the blood pressure, as it has a rapid onset and short action of duration and is easily titrated (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). The goal of surgery is to repair the aneurysm and restore vascular continuity with a vascular graft. Intensive monitoring is required after this type of surgery, and the patient is cared for in the critical care unit.</p>
<p class="indent">Repair of thoracic aneurysms using endovascular grafts placed percutaneously in an interventional suite (e.g., interventional radiology, cardiac catheterization laboratory) or combined interventional suite and operating room (hybrid suite) may decrease postoperative recovery time and decrease complications compared with traditional surgical techniques. Thoracic endografts are made of PTFE material reinforced with nitinol or titanium stents. These endovascular grafts are inserted into the thoracic aorta via various vascular access routes, usually the brachial or femoral artery. Because a large surgical incision is not necessary to gain vascular access, the overall patient recovery time tends to be shorter than with open surgical repair. Despite the absence of aortic cross-clamping, there is still a 2% to 15% chance of spinal cord ischemia as a potential complication (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Miranda, Sousa, &#x0026; Mansilha, 2018</a>). To decrease the chances of spinal cord ischemia and paraplegia, lumbar spinal drains are usually placed in patients undergoing an endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage is performed to decrease the arterial to cerebral spinal fluid gradient, thereby improving spinal perfusion. What appears to be most important in preventing neurologic deficit is to maintain the cerebrospinal fluid pressure less than or equal to 10 mm Hg (14 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and to keep the mean arterial pressure greater than 90 mm Hg for the first 36 to 48 hours postoperatively (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1962">Scali, Kim, Kubilis, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6" id="s3313"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page840" title="840"></span>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most common cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm is atherosclerosis. This condition affects men two to six times more often than women, is two to three times more common in White versus Black men, and is most prevalent in patients older than 65 years of age (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). Most of these aneurysms occur below the renal arteries (infrarenal aneurysms). Untreated, the eventual outcome may be rupture and death.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s987">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All aneurysms involve a damaged media layer of the vessel. This may be caused by congenital weakness, trauma, or disease. After an aneurysm develops, it tends to enlarge. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, nicotine use, and hypertension; more than half of patients with aneurysms have hypertension.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s988">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Only about 40% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have symptoms. Some patients complain that they can feel their heart beating in their abdomen when lying down, or they may say that they feel an abdominal mass or abdominal throbbing. If the abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with thrombus, a major vessel may be occluded or smaller distal occlusions may result from emboli. Small cholesterol, platelet, or fibrin emboli may lodge in the interosseous or digital arteries, causing cyanosis and mottling of the toes (also referred to as trashing or trash toes).</p>
<p class="indent">Signs of impending rupture include severe back or abdominal pain, which may be persistent or intermittent. Abdominal pain is often localized in the middle or lower abdomen to the left of the midline. Low back pain may be present because of pressure of the aneurysm on the lumbar nerves. Indications that the abdominal aortic aneurysm may be leaking or rupturing include constant, intense back pain; falling blood pressure; and decreasing hematocrit. Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is rapidly fatal. A retroperitoneal rupture (contained rupture) of an aneurysm may result in hematomas in the scrotum, perineum, flank, or penis. Signs of heart failure or a loud bruit may suggest a rupture into the vena cava. If the aneurysm adheres to the adjacent vena cava, the vena cava may become damaged when rupture or leak of the aneurysm occurs. Rupture into the vena cava results in higher-pressure arterial blood entering the lower-pressure venous system and causing turbulence, which is heard as a bruit. The high blood pressure and increased blood volume returning to the right side of the heart from the vena cava may cause heart failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s989">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most important diagnostic indication of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a pulsatile mass in the middle and upper abdomen. Most clinically significant aortic aneurysms are palpable during routine physical examination; however, the sensitivity depends on the size of the aneurysm, abdominal girth of the patient (i.e., more difficult to find in the patient with obesity), and the skill of the examiner (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). A systolic bruit may be heard over the mass. Duplex ultrasonography or CTA is used to determine the size, length, and location of the aneurysm. When the aneurysm is small, ultrasonography is conducted at 6-month intervals until the aneurysm reaches a size so that surgery to prevent rupture is of more benefit than the possible complications of a surgical procedure. Some aneurysms remain stable over many years of monitoring.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s990"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most abdominal aortic aneurysms occur in patients between 60 and 90 years of age. Rupture is likely with coexisting hypertension and with aneurysms more than 6 cm wide. In most cases at this point, the chances of rupture are greater than the chances of death during surgical repair. If the older patient is considered at risk for complications related to surgery or anesthesia, the aneurysm is not repaired until it is at least 5.5 cm (2 inches) wide (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1921">Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s991">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management consists of pharmacologic, endovascular, and surgical interventions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the aneurysm is stable in size based on serial duplex ultrasound scans, the blood pressure is closely monitored over time, because there is an association between increased blood pressure and aneurysm rupture (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). Antihypertensive agents, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers, are frequently prescribed to maintain the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure within acceptable limits (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endovascular and Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An expanding or enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysm is likely to rupture. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm measured at least 5.5 cm (2 inches) wide or was enlarging, the standard treatment had been open surgical repair of the aneurysm by resecting the vessel and sewing a bypass graft in place. However, endovascular aortic repair has become a mainstay of therapy for treating an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and involves the transluminal placement and attachment of a sutureless aortic graft across the aneurysm (see <a href="#ff26-12">Fig. 26-12</a>). This procedure can be performed under local or regional anesthesia. Endovascular grafting of abdominal aortic aneurysms may be performed if the patient&#x2019;s abdominal aorta and iliac arteries are not extremely tortuous, small, calcified, or filled with thrombi. Results from multiple, prospective studies suggest comparable mortality rates among patients with aneurysms treated by endovascular grafting and those treated with surgical repair, with similar 5-year survival rates (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Chaikof et al., 2018</a>). Potential complications include bleeding, hematoma, or wound infection at the arterial insertion site; distal ischemia or embolization; dissection or perforation of the aorta; graft thrombosis or infection; break of the attachment system; graft migration; proximal or distal graft leaks; delayed rupture; and bowel ischemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s992">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Before endovascular repair or surgery, nursing assessment is guided by anticipating rupture and recognizing that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page841" title="841"></span>patient may have cardiovascular, cerebral, pulmonary, and renal impairment from atherosclerosis. The functional capacity of all organ systems should be assessed. Medical therapies designed to stabilize physiologic function should be promptly implemented. Hemorrhage that leads to shock is a serious adverse consequence that must be treated decisively (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff26-12">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff26-12.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff26-12.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;26-12 &#x2022;</span> Endograft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The patient who has had an endovascular repair must lie supine for 6 hours; the head of the bed may be elevated up to 45 degrees after 2 hours. The patient needs to use a bedpan or urinal while on bed rest. Vital signs and Doppler assessment of peripheral pulses are performed initially every 15 minutes and then at progressively longer intervals if the patient&#x2019;s status remains stable. The access site (usually the femoral artery) is assessed when vital signs and pulses are monitored. The nurse assesses for bleeding and hematoma formation. Skin changes of the lower extremity, lumbar area, or buttocks that might indicate signs of embolization, such as extremely tender, irregularly shaped, cyanotic areas, as well as any changes in vital signs, pulse quality, bleeding, pulsation, swelling, pain, or hematoma, are immediately reported to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s temperature should be monitored every 4 hours, and any signs of postimplantation syndrome should be reported. Postimplantation syndrome typically begins within 24 hours of stent graft placement and consists of a spontaneously occurring fever, leukocytosis, and occasionally, transient thrombocytopenia. This condition has been attributed to complex immunologic changes that occur because of manipulations with sheaths and catheters with the aortic lumen, although the exact etiology is unknown. The symptoms are thought to be related to the activation of cytokines (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1945">Martinelli, Di Girolamo, Belli, et al., 2019</a>). They can be managed with a mild analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen) or an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g., ibuprofen) and usually subside within a week.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the increased risk of hemorrhage, the primary provider is also notified of persistent coughing, sneezing, vomiting, or systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mm Hg. Most patients can resume their preprocedure diet and are encouraged to drink fluids. An IV infusion may be continued until the patient can drink normally. Fluids are important to maintain blood flow through the arterial repair site and to assist the kidneys with excreting IV contrast agents and other medications used during the procedure. Six hours after the procedure, the patient may be able to roll from side to side and may be able to ambulate with assistance to the bathroom. Once the patient can take adequate fluids orally, the IV infusion may be discontinued.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative care requires frequent monitoring of pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic status. Possible complications of surgery include arterial occlusion, hemorrhage, infection, ischemic bowel, kidney injury, and erectile dysfunction.</p>
<h6 class="h6" id="s3314">Other Aneurysms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aneurysms may also arise in the peripheral vessels, most often as a result of atherosclerosis. These may involve such vessels as the subclavian artery, renal artery, femoral artery, or (most frequently) popliteal artery. Between 50% and 60% of popliteal aneurysms are bilateral; the true incidence is unknown but has been reported to be between 0.1% and 3% of the adult population and is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The aneurysm produces a pulsating mass and disturbs peripheral circulation distal to it. Pain and swelling develop because of pressure on adjacent nerves and veins. Diagnosis is made by duplex ultrasonography or CTA to determine the size, length, and extent of the aneurysm. Arteriography may be performed to evaluate the level of proximal and distal involvement. The major complication associated with popliteal artery aneurysms is not rupture but distal embolization (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>). Surgical repair is performed with replacement grafts. As an alternative, endovascular repair using a stent graft or wall graft, which is a Dacron or PTFE graft with external structures made from a variety of materials (e.g., nitinol, titanium, stainless steel) may be selected for additional support.</p>
