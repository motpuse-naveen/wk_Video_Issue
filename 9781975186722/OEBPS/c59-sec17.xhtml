<p class="nonindent"><strong>M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease</strong> is an abnormality in inner ear fluid balance caused by a malabsorption in the endolymphatic sac or a blockage in the endolymphatic duct (NIDCD, 2017b). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endolymphatic hydrops:&lt;/b&gt; dilation of the endolymphatic space of the inner ear; the pathologic correlate of M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease">Endolymphatic hydrops</button></strong> (dilation of the endolymphatic space) frequently occurs, causing either increased pressure in the system or rupture of the inner ear membrane, producing symptoms of M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4253">van Steekelenburg, van Weijnen, de Pont, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease affects 10 to 12 of 1000 people in the United States. It is estimated that there are 615,000 cases in the United States, with approximately 45,500 new cases diagnosed annually (NIDCD, 2017b). More common in adults, onset is generally seen when adults reach their 40s, with symptoms usually beginning between the ages of 20 and 60&#x00A0;years. M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease appears to be equally common in men and women, and is usually bilateral (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2893">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease is characterized by a triad of symptoms: episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Luryi, Morse, &#x0026; Michaelides, 2019</a>). It may also include a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear and incapacitating vertigo, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting (NIDCD, 2017b). These symptoms range in severity from a minor nuisance to extreme disability, especially if the attacks of vertigo are severe. At the onset of the disease, usually only one or two of the symptoms are manifested.</p>
<p class="indent">The disease may be characterized into two subsets: cochlear and vestibular. Cochlear M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease is recognized as a fluctuating, progressive sensorineural hearing loss associated with tinnitus and aural pressure in the absence of vestibular symptoms or findings. Vestibular M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease is characterized as the occurrence of episodic vertigo associated with aural pressure but no cochlear symptoms. Patients may experience either cochlear or vestibular disease symptoms at first; however, eventually all of these symptoms develop.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2894">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vertigo is usually the most troublesome complaint related to M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease. A careful history is taken to determine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1954" title="1954"></span>the frequency, duration, severity, and character of the vertigo attacks. Vertigo may last minutes to hours, possibly accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Diaphoresis and a persistent feeling of imbalance or disequilibrium may awaken patients at night. Some patients report that these feelings last for days. However, they usually feel well between attacks. Hearing loss may fluctuate, with tinnitus and aural pressure waxing and waning with changes in hearing. These feelings may occur during or before attacks, or they may be constant.</p>
<p class="indent">Physical examination findings are usually normal, with the exception of those of cranial nerve VIII. Sounds from a tuning fork (Weber test) may lateralize to the ear opposite the hearing loss, the one affected with M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease. An audiogram typically reveals a sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. This can be in the form of a pattern that looks like a hill or mountain. A sensorineural loss in the low frequencies occurs as the disease progresses. The electronystagmogram may be normal or may show reduced vestibular response.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2895">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients with M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease can be successfully treated with diet and medication. Many patients can control their symptoms by adhering to a low-sodium (1000 to 1500 mg/day or less) diet. <a href="#ct59-8">Chart 59-8</a> describes dietary guidelines that may be useful in M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease. The amount of sodium is one of many factors that regulate the balance of fluid within the body. Sodium and fluid retention disrupts the delicate balance between endolymph and perilymph in the inner ear. Psychological evaluation and cognitive therapy may be indicated if a patient is anxious, uncertain, fearful, or depressed (NIDCD, 2017b).</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Dietary Guidelines for Patients with M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s Disease</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>limit foods high in salt or sugar. Be aware of foods with hidden salts and sugars.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>eat meals and snacks at regular intervals to stay hydrated. Missing meals or snacks may alter the fluid level in the inner ear.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>eat fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit the amount of canned, frozen, or processed foods with high sodium content.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>drink plenty of fluids daily. Water, milk, and low-sugar fruit juices are recommended. Limit intake of coffee, tea, and soft drinks. Avoid caffeine because of its diuretic effect.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>limit alcohol intake. Alcohol may change the volume and concentration of the inner ear fluid and may worsen symptoms.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG), which may increase symptoms.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>pay attention to the intake of foods containing potassium (e.g., bananas, tomatoes, oranges) if taking a diuretic that causes potassium loss.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>avoid aspirin and aspirin-containing medications. Aspirin may increase tinnitus and dizziness.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic therapy for M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease consists of antihistamines, such as meclizine, which shortens the attack (NIDCD, 2017b). Tranquilizers such as diazepam may be used in acute instances to help control vertigo. Antiemetic agents such as promethazine suppositories help control the nausea and vomiting and the vertigo because of their antihistamine effect. Diuretic therapy (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, spironolactone) may relieve symptoms by lowering the pressure in the endolymphatic system (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Norris, 2019</a>). Intratympanic injection of gentamicin is used to cause ablation of the vestibular hair cells; however, the risk of significant hearing loss is high (NIDCD, 2017b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although most patients respond well to conservative therapy, some continue to have disabling attacks of vertigo. If these attacks reduce their quality of life, patients may elect to undergo surgery for relief. Surgical procedures include endolymphatic sac procedures and vestibular nerve section (NIDCD, 2017b). However, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness may continue, because the surgical treatment of M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease is aimed at eliminating the attacks of vertigo.</p>
<p class="h7">Endolymphatic Sac Decompression</p>
<p class="nonindent">Endolymphatic sac decompression, or shunting, theoretically equalizes the pressure in the endolymphatic space. A shunt or drain is inserted in the endolymphatic sac through a postauricular incision. This procedure is favored by many otolaryngologists as a first-line surgical approach to treat the vertigo of M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease because it is relatively simple and safe and can be performed on an outpatient basis.</p>
<p class="h7">Vestibular Nerve Sectioning</p>
<p class="nonindent">Vestibular nerve sectioning provides the greatest success rate (approximately 98%) in eliminating the attacks of vertigo. It can be performed by a translabyrinthine approach (i.e., through the hearing mechanism) or in a manner that can conserve hearing (i.e., suboccipital or middle cranial fossa), depending on the degree of hearing loss. Most patients with incapacitating M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease have little or no effective hearing. Cutting the nerve prevents the brain from receiving input from the semicircular canals. This procedure may require a brief hospital stay. A plan of nursing care for the patient with vertigo is presented in <a href="c59-sec18.xhtml#ct59-9">Chart 59-9</a>.</p>
