<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aspiration:&lt;/b&gt; inhalation of either oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower airways">Aspiration</button></strong> is inhalation of foreign material (e.g., oropharyngeal or stomach contents) into the lungs. It is a serious complication that can cause pneumonia and result in the following clinical picture: tachycardia, dyspnea, central cyanosis, hypertension, hypotension, and potentially death. It can occur when the protective airway reflexes are decreased or absent due to a variety of factors (see <a href="#ct19-8">Chart&#x00A0;19-8</a>). Studies suggest that aspiration pneumonia accounts for 5% to 15% of CAP (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Gamache, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s640">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The primary factors responsible for death and complications after aspiration are the volume and character of the aspirated contents. Aspiration pneumonia develops after inhalation of colonized oral or pharyngeal material. The pathologic process involves an acute inflammatory response to bacteria and bacterial products. Most commonly, the causative organisms in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia may include <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>H. influenzae</em>, and <em>Enterobacter</em> species (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Gamache, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A full stomach contains solid particles of food. If these are aspirated, the problem then becomes one of mechanical blockage of the airways and secondary infection. During periods of fasting, the stomach contains acidic gastric juice, which, if aspirated, can be very destructive to the alveoli and capillaries. Fecal contamination (more likely seen in intestinal obstruction) increases the likelihood of death, because the endotoxins produced by intestinal organisms may be absorbed systemically, or the thick proteinaceous material found in the intestinal contents may obstruct the airway, leading to atelectasis and secondary bacterial invasion.</p>
<p class="indent">Esophageal conditions may also be associated with aspiration pneumonia. These include dysphagia, esophageal strictures, neoplasm or diverticula, tracheoesophageal fistula, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s641">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The risk of aspiration is indirectly related to the level of consciousness of the patient. Aspiration of small amounts of material from the buccal (oral) cavity is not uncommon, particularly during sleep; however, disease as a result of aspiration does not occur in healthy people because the material is cleared by the mucociliary tree and the macrophages. Witnessed aspiration of large volumes occurs occasionally; however, small-volume clinically silent aspiration is more common. Prevention is the primary goal when caring for patients at risk for aspiration (American Association of Critical Care Nurses [AACN], 2017b).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When a nonfunctioning nasogastric tube allows the gastric contents to accumulate in the stomach, a condition known as silent aspiration may result. Silent aspiration often occurs unobserved and may be more common than suspected. If untreated, massive inhalation of gastric contents develops in a period of several hours.</em></p></div>

<h6 class="h6">Compensating for Absent Reflexes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aspiration may occur if the patient cannot adequately coordinate protective glottic, laryngeal, and cough reflexes. This hazard is increased if the patient has a distended abdomen, is supine, has the upper extremities immobilized in any manner, receives local anesthetic agents to the oropharyngeal or laryngeal area for diagnostic procedures, has been sedated, or has had long-term intubation. Clinical interventions are key to preventing aspiration (see <a href="#ct19-9">Chart&#x00A0;19-9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with known swallowing dysfunction or those recently extubated following prolonged ET intubation, a swallowing screen is necessary. Patients deemed at risk are then assessed by a speech therapist. Besides positioning the patient semirecumbent or upright prior to eating, other helpful techniques may include suggesting a soft diet and encouraging the patient to take small bites. The patient should be instructed to keep the chin tucked and the head turned with repeated swallowing. Straws should not be used.</p>

<p class="indent">When vomiting, people can normally protect their airway by sitting up or turning on the side and coordinating breathing, coughing, gag, and glottic reflexes. If these reflexes are active, an oral airway should not be inserted. If an airway is in place, it should be pulled out the moment the patient gags so as not to stimulate the pharyngeal gag reflex and promote vomiting and aspiration. Suctioning of oral secretions with a catheter should be performed with minimal pharyngeal stimulation.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with an ET tube and feeding tube, the ET cuff pressure should be maintained at greater than 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (but less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to minimize injury) to prevent leakage of secretions from around the cuff into the lower respiratory tract. In addition, hypopharyngeal suctioning is recommended before the cuff is deflated (AACN, 2017a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Feeding Tube Placement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tube feedings must be given only when it is certain that the feeding tube is positioned correctly in the stomach. Many patients receive enteral feeding directly into the duodenum through a small-bore flexible feeding tube or surgically implanted tube. (See <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for discussion of enteral tube feedings.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Identifying Delayed Stomach Emptying</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A full stomach can cause aspiration because of increased intragastric or extragastric pressure. The following may delay emptying of the stomach: intestinal obstruction; increased gastric secretions in gastroesophageal reflex disease; increased gastric secretions during anxiety, stress, or pain; and abdominal distention due to paralytic ileus, ascites, peritonitis, the use of opioids or sedatives, severe illness, or vaginal delivery. (See <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for discussion of management of patients receiving gastric tube feedings.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Effects of Prolonged Intubation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prolonged ET intubation or tracheostomy (see later discussions) can depress the laryngeal and glottic reflexes because of disuse. Patients with prolonged tracheostomies are encouraged to phonate and exercise their laryngeal muscles. For patients who have had long-term intubation or tracheostomies, it may be helpful to have a speech therapist experienced in swallowing disorders work with the patient to address swallowing problems, as noted previously.</p>
