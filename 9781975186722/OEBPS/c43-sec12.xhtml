<h4 class="h4" id="s1832">Hepatitis A Virus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The HAV accounts for 20% to 25% of cases of clinical hepatitis in the United States (CDC, 2017). Hepatitis A, formerly called <em>infectious hepatitis,</em> is caused by an RNA virus of the enterovirus family. In the United States, the disease is seen mainly in the adult population. HAV is transmitted primarily through the fecal&#x2013;oral route, by the ingestion of food or liquids infected with the virus. It is more prevalent in countries with overcrowding and poor sanitation. The virus has been found in the stool of infected patients before the onset of symptoms and during the first few days of illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, a child or a young adult acquires the infection at school through poor hygiene, hand-to-mouth contact, or other close contact. The virus is carried home, where haphazard sanitary habits spread it through the family. An infected food handler can spread the disease, and people can contract it by consuming water or shellfish from sewage-contaminated waters. Outbreaks have occurred in day care centers and institutions as a result of poor hygiene among people with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1386" title="1386"></span>developmental disability. Hepatitis A can be transmitted during sexual activity; this is more likely with oral&#x2013;anal contact or anal intercourse and with multiple sex partners (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Shin &#x0026; Jeong, 2018</a>). Hepatitis A is not transmitted by blood transfusions.</p>
<p class="indent">The incubation period is estimated to be between 2 and 6 weeks, with a mean of approximately 4 weeks (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Shin &#x0026; Jeong, 2018</a>). The illness may be prolonged, lasting 4 to 8 weeks. It usually lasts longer and is more severe in those older than 40 years. Most patients recover from hepatitis A; it rarely progresses to acute liver necrosis or acute hepatic failure resulting in cirrhosis of the liver or death. The mortality rate of hepatitis A is approximately 0.5% for those younger than 40 years and 1% to 2% for older adults. In patients with underlying chronic liver disease, morbidity and mortality are increased in the presence of an acute hepatitis A infection. No carrier state exists, and no chronic hepatitis is associated with the HAV. The virus is present only briefly in the serum; by the time jaundice occurs, the patient is likely to be noninfectious. Although hepatitis A confers immunity against itself, the person may contract other forms of hepatitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1833">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients are anicteric (without jaundice) and symptomless. When symptoms appear, they resemble those of a mild, flu-like upper respiratory tract infection, with low-grade fever. Anorexia, an early symptom, is often severe. It is thought to result from release of a toxin by the damaged liver or from failure of the damaged liver cells to detoxify an abnormal product. Later, jaundice and dark urine may become apparent. Indigestion is present in varying degrees, marked by vague epigastric distress, nausea, heartburn, and flatulence. The patient may also develop a strong aversion to the taste of cigarettes or the presence of cigarette smoke and other strong odors (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Shin &#x0026; Jeong, 2018</a>). These symptoms tend to clear as soon as the jaundice reaches its peak, perhaps 10 days after its initial appearance. Symptoms may be mild in children; in adults, they may be more severe and the course of the disease prolonged.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1834">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The liver and spleen are often moderately enlarged for a few days after onset; other than jaundice, there are few other physical signs. An HAV antigen may be found in the stool 7 to 10 days before illness and for 2 to 3 weeks after symptoms appear. HAV antibodies are detectable in the serum, although usually not until symptoms appear. Analysis of subclasses of immunoglobulins can help determine whether the antibody represents acute or past infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1835">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A number of strategies exist to prevent transmission of HAV. Patients and their families are encouraged to follow general precautions that can prevent transmission of the virus. Scrupulous hand hygiene, safe water supplies, and proper control of sewage disposal are just a few of these prevention strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">Effective (95% to 100% after two to three doses) and safe HAV vaccines are available (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Link-Gelles, Hofmeister, &#x0026; Nelson, 2018</a>). It is recommended that the two-dose vaccine be given to adults 18 years of age or older, with the second dose given 6 to 12 months after the first. Protection against HAV develops within several weeks after the first dose of the vaccine. Children and adolescents 1 to 18 years of age receive three doses; the second dose is given 1 month after the first, and the third dose is given 6 to 12 months later. HAV routine immunization of young children has proved to be effective in reducing disease incidence and maintaining very low incidence levels among vaccine recipients and across all age groups in many settings (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>). As a result of its effectiveness in decreasing HAV, the hepatitis A vaccination recommendations have been expanded to include all children at 1 year of age. Hepatitis A vaccine is also recommended for people traveling to locations where sanitation and hygiene are unsatisfactory. Vaccination is also recommended for those from high-risk groups, such as men who have sex with men, people who use IV or injection drugs, staff of day care centers, health care personnel and those who work with the virus in research or animal care settings (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>). The vaccine has also been used to interrupt community-wide outbreaks. A combined HAV and HBV vaccine is available for vaccination of people 18 years of age and older with indications for both HAV and HBV vaccination. Vaccination consists of three doses, given on the same schedule as that used for single-antigen HBV vaccine.</p>
<p class="indent">For people who have not been previously vaccinated, HAV can be prevented by intramuscular administration of globulin during the incubation period, if given within 2 weeks of exposure. This bolsters the person&#x2019;s antibody production and provides 6 to 8 weeks of passive immunity. Immune globulin may suppress overt symptoms of the disease; the resulting subclinical case of HAV would produce immunity to subsequent episodes of the virus.</p>
<p class="indent">Immune globulin is also recommended for household members and sexual contacts of people with HAV. Susceptible people in the same household as the patient are usually also infected by the time the diagnosis is made and should receive immune globulin. Institutional contacts of patients with HAV should also receive post-exposure prophylaxis with immune globulin. Prophylaxis is not necessary for casual contacts of an infected person, such as classmates, coworkers, or hospital employees (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Link-Gelles et al., 2018</a>). Although rare, systemic reactions to immune globulin do occur. Caution is required when anyone who has previously had angioedema, hives, or other allergic reactions is treated with any human immune globulin. Epinephrine should be available in case of systemic, anaphylactic reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Pre-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for those traveling to developing countries or settings with poor or uncertain sanitation conditions who do not have sufficient time to acquire protection by administration of hepatitis A vaccine (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>). Prevention strategies for HAV are outlined in <a href="#ct43-5">Chart 43-5</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1836">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bed rest during the acute stage and a nutritious diet are important aspects of treatment. During the period of anorexia, the patient should receive frequent small feedings, supplemented if necessary by IV fluids with glucose. Because the patient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1387" title="1387"></span>often has an aversion to food, gentle persistence, and creativity may be required to stimulate appetite. Optimal food and fluid levels are necessary to counteract weight loss and to speed recovery. Even before the icteric phase, however, many patients recover their appetites (see <a href="#ct43-6">Chart 43-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s sense of well-being and laboratory test results are generally appropriate guides to bed rest and restriction of physical activity. Gradual but progressive ambulation hastens recovery.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1837">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management usually occurs in the home unless symptoms are severe. Therefore, the nurse assists the patient and family in coping with the temporary disability and fatigue that are common with HAV and educates them to seek additional health care if the symptoms persist or worsen. The patient and family also need specific guidelines about diet, rest, follow-up blood work, and the importance of avoiding alcohol, as well as sanitation and hygiene measures (particularly hand hygiene) to prevent spread of the disease to other family members.</p>
<p class="indent">Specific education for patients and families about reducing the risk of contracting HAV includes good personal hygiene, stressing careful hand hygiene (after bowel movements and before eating) and environmental sanitation (safe food and water supply, effective sewage disposal).</p>
