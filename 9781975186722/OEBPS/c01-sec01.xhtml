<p class="nonindent">Since the time of Florence Nightingale, who wrote in 1858 that the goal of nursing was &#x201C;to put the patient in the best condition foar nature to act upon him,&#x201D; nursing scholars and leaders have described nursing as both an art and a science. However, the definition of nursing has evolved over time. In the American Nurses Association (ANA) Scope and Standards of Practice (ANA, 2015b, p. 1), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing:&lt;/b&gt; according to the American Nurses Association (2015b), &#x201C;the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, facilitation of healing, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations&#x201D; (p. 1)">nursing</button></strong> is defined as &#x201C;the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, facilitation of healing, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations.&#x201D; Nurses have a responsibility to carry out their role as described in Nursing&#x2019;s Social Policy Statement (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib2">ANA, 2010</a>; <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Fowler, 2015</a>), to comply with the nurse practice act of the state in which they practice, and to comply with the Code of Ethics for Nurses as spelled out by the ANA (2015a) and the International Council of Nurses (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib13">ICN, 2012</a>). Advocacy, promotion of a safe environment, research, education, and participation in patient and health systems management as well as shaping health policy are also key nursing roles (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib13">ICN, 2012</a>).</p>
