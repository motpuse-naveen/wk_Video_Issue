<p class="nonindent">The outlook for patients with cancer has greatly improved because of scientific and technologic advances. However, as a result of the underlying disease or various treatment modalities, patients with cancer may experience a variety of secondary problems such as reduced WBC counts, infection, bleeding, skin and nutritional problems, pain, fatigue, and psychological stress. <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a> provides a nursing care plan for the patient with cancer.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s413">Maintaining Tissue Integrity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Some of the most frequently encountered disturbances of tissue integrity include stomatitis, skin and tissue reactions to radiation therapy, cutaneous toxicities associated with targeted therapy, alopecia, and metastatic skin lesions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Stomatitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Mucositis, a common side effect of radiation and some types of chemotherapy, refers to an inflammatory process involving the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stomatitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the oral tissues, often associated with some chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy to the head and neck region">Stomatitis</button></strong>, a form of mucositis, is an inflammatory process of the mouth, including the mucosa and tissues surrounding the teeth. Stomatitis is characterized by changes in sensation, erythema (mild redness), and edema or, if severe, by painful ulcerations, bleeding, and secondary infection. Stomatitis commonly develops within 3 to 14 days after patients receive certain chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin), immunotherapies (e.g., IL-2 and nivolumab); and targeted therapies (e.g., temsirolimus and everolimus). Stomatitis affects up to 100% of patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with HSCT, 90% of patients with malignancies of the head and neck receiving radiotherapy, and up to 40% of patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib973">Eilers, Asakura, Blecher, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Stomatitis may be worse in patients with head and neck cancers who receive combined modality therapy of both radiation and chemotherapy. When severe, stomatitis can lead to interruptions, delays, and modifications in the course of treatment, all of which may contribute to less desirable patient outcomes. Severe oral pain can significantly affect swallowing, nutritional intake, speech, quality of life, coping abilities, and willingness to adhere to treatment regimens. In addition, stomatitis may lead to more frequent health care visits, hospitalizations, and increased health care costs (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib955">Berger, Schopohl, Bollig, et al., 2018</a>). Stomatitis and mucositis are attributed to a cascade of molecular processes and submucosal endothelial cell destruction that begin almost immediately after the initiation of radiation and certain types of chemotherapy, prior to the development of signs and symptoms. Mucositis develops because of a sequence of related and interacting biologic events, culminating in injury and apoptosis of basal epithelial cells, leading to the loss of epithelial renewal, atrophy, and ulceration. Gram-positive and gram-negative organisms can invade the ulcerated tissue and result in infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing assessment begins with an understanding of the patient&#x2019;s usual practices for oral hygiene and identification of individuals at risk for stomatitis. Oral cavity assessment is performed daily or at each patient visit (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Risk factors and comorbidities associated with stomatitis include poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, existing dental disease, prior irradiation to the head and neck region, impaired salivary gland function, the use of other medications that dry mucous membranes, myelosuppression, tobacco use, previous cancer treatment with a stomatotoxic agent or radiation therapy, diminished renal function, impaired nutritional status, and both older (&#x003E;65 years) and younger (&#x003C;20 years) ages (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). The patient is also assessed for dehydration, infection, pain, and nutritional impairment resulting from mucositis.</p>
<p class="indent">Optimal evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches for stomatitis remain limited but continue to be studied across disciplines (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib957">Bowen, Gibson, Coller, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Eilers et al., 2017</a>). Most clinicians agree that maintenance of good oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing, rinsing, and dental care, is necessary to minimize the risk of oral complications associated with cancer therapies.</p>
<p class="indent">Palifermin, an IV-administered synthetic form of human keratinocyte growth factor, is beneficial in the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients with hematologic malignancies who are preparing for HSCT and in those undergoing chemotherapy for head and neck cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bowen et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Eilers et al., 2017</a>). Palifermin promotes epithelial cell repair and accelerated replacement of cells in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. Careful timing of administration and monitoring are essential for effectiveness and to detect adverse effects. Other approaches recommended for practice include cryotherapy (topical application of oral ice during infusions), consistent oral hygiene, low-level laser therapy, and sodium bicarbonate mouth rinses (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bowen et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Eilers et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).

<h6 class="h6">Radiation-Associated Impairment of Skin Integrity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although advances in radiation therapy have resulted in decreased incidence and severity of skin impairments, patients may still develop radiodermatitis, formerly called radiation dermatitis, associated with pain, irritation, pruritus, burning, skin sloughing without drainage (dry desquamation) or with drainage (wet desquamation), and diminished quality of life (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib978">Gosselin, Beamer, Ciccolini, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Nursing care for patients with radiodermatitis includes maintenance of skin integrity, cleansing, promotion of comfort, pain reduction, prevention of additional trauma, prevention and management of infection, and promotion of a moist wound-healing environment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). In order to prevent impaired skin integrity, patients are advised to use moisturizer on the skin, avoid sun exposure to the area of treatment, and avoid tape or bandages and other sources of irritation or trauma. Although a variety of methods and products are used in clinical practice for patients with radiation-induced skin impairment, there is limited evidence to support their value (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Gosselin et al., 2017</a>). Patients with skin and tissue reactions to radiation therapy require careful skin care to prevent further skin irritation, drying, and damage, as discussed in the nursing care plan (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>, Risk for impaired skin integrity: erythematous and wet desquamation reactions to radiation therapy).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Alopecia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The temporary or permanent thinning or complete loss of hair is a potential adverse effect of whole brain radiation therapy, various chemotherapies and targeted agents. Alopecia usually begins 1 to 3 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy and radiation therapy; regrowth most often begins within 8 weeks after the last treatment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Some patients who undergo radiation to the head may sustain permanent hair loss. The onset of gradually progressing alopecia and body hair loss associated with targeted therapies generally occurs 1 to 3 months after the start of treatment and may be patchy appearing as temporal or frontal hair loss (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib953">Barton-Burke, Ciccolini, Mekas, et al., 2017</a>). This type of hair loss is usually reversible after the end of therapy and in some cases beginning sooner. Several targeted agents are associated with changes in hair growth rate, curliness, texture, and pigmentation. Although health care providers may view hair loss as a minor issue, for many patients it is a major assault on body image, challenging to self-esteem, and resulting in psychosocial distress and depression. Despite the significant psychosocial impact of alopecia, few studies have addressed methods to prevent or minimize the impact of alopecia. The use of cryotherapy to the head (scalp cooling) has been shown to be effective in reducing alopecia during chemotherapy administration (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Ross &#x0026; Fischer-Cartlidge, 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Rugo, Melin, &#x0026; Voigt, 2017</a>). However, due to reports of scalp metastasis and a lack of safety data, cryotherapy is not recommended for use in patients with hematologic malignancies (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Rugo et al., 2017</a>). Nurses provide information about hair loss and support the patient and family in coping with changes in body image. Patients are assisted to identify proactive choices that may empower them to improve responses to cancer and perceived lack of control as discussed in the nursing care plan (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>, Impaired tissue integrity: alopecia).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Malignant Skin Lesions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Skin lesions may occur with local extension or metastasis of the tumor into the epithelium and its surrounding lymph and blood vessels. Either locally invasive or metastatic cancer to the skin may result in erythema, discolored nodules, or progression to wounds involving edema, exudates, and tissue necrosis. The most extensive lesions involve ulceration (referred to as fungating lesions) with an overgrowth of malodorous microorganisms. These lesions are a source of considerable pain, discomfort, and embarrassment. Although skin lesions occur in various malignancies, they are most commonly associated with breast cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Ulcerating skin lesions usually indicate advanced or disseminated disease that is unlikely to be eradicated but may be controlled or palliated through systemic treatment (chemotherapy and targeted therapy) or radiation therapy. Local care of these lesions is a nursing priority. Nurses carefully assess malignant skin lesions for the size, appearance, condition of surrounding tissue, odor, bleeding, drainage, and associated pain or other symptoms, including evidence of infection. The potential for serious complications such as hemorrhage, vessel compression/obstruction, or airway obstruction, especially in head and neck cancer, should be noted so that the caregiver can be instructed in palliative measures to maintain patient comfort.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>) also includes wound cleansing, reduction of superficial bacteria, control of bleeding, odor reduction, protection from further skin trauma, and pain management. The patient and family require emotional support, assistance, and guidance in providing wound care and addressing comfort measures at home.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s414">Promoting Nutrition</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients with cancer experience some weight loss during their illness. Thus nurses need to promote good nutrition throughout treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Impairment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anorexia, malabsorption, and cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS) are some common nutritional problems. Impaired nutritional status may contribute to both physical and psychosocial consequences (see <a href="#ct12-7">Chart&#x00A0;12-7</a>). Nutritional concerns include decreased protein and caloric intake, metabolic or mechanical effects of the cancer, systemic disease, side effects of the treatment, or the patient&#x2019;s emotional status.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Anorexia</p>
<p class="nonindent">Among the many causes of anorexia in patients with cancer are alterations in taste, manifested by increased salty, sour, and metallic taste sensations, and altered responses to sweet and bitter flavors. Taste changes contribute to decreased appetite and nutritional intake and subsequently protein&#x2013;calorie malnutrition. Taste alterations may result from mineral (e.g., zinc) deficiencies, increases in circulating amino acids and cellular metabolites, or the administration of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing radiation therapy to the head and neck may experience &#x201C;mouth blindness,&#x201D; which is a severe impairment of taste.</p>
<p class="indent">Anorexia may occur because patients develop early satiety after eating only a small amount of food. This sense of fullness occurs secondary to a decrease in digestive enzymes, abnormalities in the metabolism of glucose and triglycerides, and prolonged stimulation of gastric volume receptors, which convey the feeling of being full. Psychological distress (e.g., fear, pain, depression, isolation) throughout illness may also have a negative impact on appetite. Patients may develop an aversion to food because of nausea and vomiting associated with treatment.</p>
<p class="h7">Malabsorption</p>
<p class="nonindent">Some patients with cancer are unable to absorb nutrients from the gastrointestinal system as a result of tumor activity, cancer treatments, or both. Malignancy can affect gastrointestinal activity in several ways (e.g., impaired enzyme production, interference with both protein and fat digestion) that can lead to increased gastrointestinal irritation, peptic ulcer disease, and fistula formation.</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapy and radiation associated with mucositis cause damage to mucosal cells of the bowel, resulting in impaired nutrient absorption. Abdominal irradiation has been associated with sclerosis of intestinal blood vessels and fibrotic changes in the gastrointestinal tissue, both impacting nutrient absorption. Surgical intervention may change peristaltic patterns, alter gastrointestinal secretions, and reduce the absorptive surfaces of gastrointestinal mucosa, all of which contribute to malabsorption.</p>
<p class="h7">Cancer-Related Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">CACS is a complex biologic process that results from a combination of increased energy expenditure and decreased intake (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Mattox, 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). This syndrome can occur in both the curative and palliative stages of treatment and care. Combined immunologic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic processes give rise to anorexia, unintentional weight loss, and increased metabolic demand with impaired metabolism of glucose and lipids. As this syndrome continues, altered metabolic processes and tumor responses lead to cytokine release, causing generalized systemic inflammation. The patient experiences continued weight loss and malnutrition characterized by loss of adipose tissue, visceral protein, and skeletal muscle mass. Patients with CACS complain of loss of appetite, early satiety, and fatigue. It is estimated that 50% of patients with cancer experience anorexia and cachexia; this percentage increases to as high as 86% in patients with advanced cancer at the end of life (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Protein losses are associated with the development of anemia, peripheral edema, and progressive debilitation. The signs and symptoms of cancer cachexia and progressive debilitation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page351" title="351"></span>result in decreased quality of life, psychological distress, and anxiety for both patient and family as they respond to actual and perceived impending losses, fear, lack of control, and helplessness.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care is integral to an interdisciplinary approach that addresses the multiple factors contributing to impaired nutritional status in patients with cancer (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">General Nutrition Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status is conducted at diagnosis and monitored throughout the course of treatment and follow-up. Early identification of patients at risk for problems with intake, absorption, and cachexia, particularly during the early stages of disease, can facilitate timely implementation of specifically targeted interventions that attempt to improve quality of life, treatment outcomes, and survival (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib993">Krishnasamy, Yoong, Chan, et al., 2017</a>). Current weight, weight loss, diet and medication history, patterns of anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and situations and foods that aggravate or relieve symptoms are assessed and addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">The type of cancer, stage, and treatment approaches are considered so that proactive measures to support nutrition can be identified. For example, patients with head and neck cancers who are treated with radiation therapy, or some combination of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or targeted agents, are at high risk for inadequate oral intake and nutritional deficits. In many centers, these patients have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed for enteral nutrition prior to initiation of treatment and the onset of mucositis, weight loss, and other consequences of impaired oral intake. A speech therapy consult may be helpful for patients with oropharyngeal or laryngeal tumors or surgical interventions that are anticipated to effect swallowing, secretion management, speech, or respiratory function.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever possible, every effort is made to maintain adequate nutrition through the oral route. Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide are used to increase gastric emptying in patients with early satiety and delayed gastric emptying. Other pharmacologic interventions such as megestrol acetate or corticosteroids (on a short-term basis) may be used to improve appetite. Oral nutritional supplements are encouraged to meet nutritional needs and to maintain or improve weight gain and physical functioning. Approaches incorporate nutritional counseling, exercise, pharmacologic interventions to combat anorexia, and symptom management when feasible (NCCN, 2019g). If adequate nutrition cannot be maintained by oral intake, nutritional support via the enteral route may be necessary as discussed previously. When needed, the patient and family are taught to administer enteral nutrition in the home. Home health nurses assist with patient education and monitor the patient&#x2019;s symptoms and response to enteral nutrition.</p>
<p class="indent">When malabsorption is a problem, enzyme and vitamin replacement may be instituted. Additional strategies include changing the feeding schedule, using simple diets, and relieving diarrhea. If malabsorption is severe, or the cancer involves the upper gastrointestinal tract, parenteral nutrition may be necessary. However, patients receiving parenteral nutrition are at increased risk for complications, including catheter-related and systemic infection. The use of parenteral nutrition in patients with advanced or end-stage cancer is seldom used and controversial (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jatoi &#x0026; Kelly, 2019</a>). Parenteral nutrition can be given in several ways: by a long-term venous access device such as a right atrial catheter (see <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#ff12-3">Fig.&#x00A0;12-3</a>), implanted venous port (see <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#ff12-4">Fig.&#x00A0;12-4</a>), or PICC (see <a href="#ff12-6">Fig.&#x00A0;12-6</a>). The nurse educates the patient and family to care for the venous access device and to administer parenteral nutrition. Home health nurses provide education and assist with or supervise parenteral nutrition administration in the home.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s415">Relieving Pain</h5>
<p class="nonindent">More than half of patients with cancer experience pain throughout the cancer trajectory. Moderate to severe pain is reported by approximately 28% of patients with cancer during treatment and as many as 52% of those with advanced disease (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1047">van den Beuken-van Everdingen, Hochstenbach, Joosten, et al., 2016</a>). Although cancer pain may be acute, it is more frequently characterized as chronic. (See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for more information on pain.) As in other situations involving pain, the experience of cancer pain is influenced by physical, psychosocial, cultural, and spiritual factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Cancer can cause pain in various ways (see <a href="#tt12-9">Table&#x00A0;12-9</a>). Initially, pain is most often related to the underlying cancer process. Pain is also associated with various cancer treatments. Acute pain is linked with trauma from surgery. Occasionally, chronic pain syndromes, such as postsurgical neuropathies (pain related to nerve tissue injury), occur. Some chemotherapeutic agents cause tissue necrosis, peripheral neuropathies, and stomatitis&#x2014;all potential sources of pain&#x2014;whereas radiation therapy can cause pain secondary to skin, nervous tissue, or organ inflammation. Patients with cancer may have other sources of pain, such as arthritis or migraine headaches, that are unrelated to the underlying cancer or its treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the patient for the source and site of pain as well as those factors that influence the patient&#x2019;s perception and experience of pain, such as fear and apprehension, fatigue, anger, and social isolation. Pain assessment scales are useful for assessing the patient&#x2019;s pain before and after pain-relieving interventions are instituted to assess the effectiveness of interventions. Other symptoms that contribute to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page352" title="352"></span>pain experience, such as nausea and fatigue, are assessed and addressed as well.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Today, most people expect pain to disappear or resolve quickly. Although it is often controllable, advanced cancer pain is commonly irreversible and not quickly resolved. For many patients, pain is often seen as a signal that cancer is advancing, and that death is approaching. As patients anticipate pain and anxiety increases, pain perception heightens, producing fear and further pain. Thus, chronic cancer pain can lead to a cycle progressing from pain to anxiety to fear and back to pain, especially when the pain is not adequately managed. Inadequate pain management is most often the result of misconceptions and insufficient knowledge about pain assessment and management on the part of patients, families, and health care providers (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Scarborough &#x0026; Smith, 2018</a>). <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> provides information regarding factors contributing to the pain experience, pain perception, and tolerance as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic nursing interventions addressing pain. The nursing care plan (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>) also provides strategies for nursing assessment and management of chronic pain. Analgesics are administered based on the patient&#x2019;s reported level of pain. A cancer pain algorithm, developed as a set of analgesic guiding principles, is given in <a href="#ff12-7">Figure&#x00A0;12-7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, even those that may be invasive, are considered in managing cancer-related pain regardless of the patient&#x2019;s status along the cancer trajectory. The nurse assists the patient and family to take an active role in managing pain. The nurse provides education and support to correct fears and misconceptions about opioid use. Inadequate pain management leads to a diminished quality of life characterized by distress, suffering, anxiety, fear, immobility, isolation, and depression.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s416">Decreasing Fatigue</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fatigue is one of the most frequent and distressing symptoms experienced by patients receiving cancer therapy. Patients report that fatigue persists and interferes with activities of daily living for months to years after the completion of treatment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1053">Wang, Yang, Miao, et al., 2018</a>). Fatigue rarely exists in isolation; patients typically experience other symptoms concurrently, such as pain, dyspnea, anemia, sleep disturbances, or depression. The relationship between sleep disturbances, fatigue, and depression (as well as other clinical factors) in older adults with cancer is an active area of research.</p>
<p class="indent">In assessing fatigue, the nurse distinguishes between <em>acute fatigue,</em> which occurs after an energy-demanding experience, and <em>cancer-related fatigue,</em> which is defined as &#x201C;a distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning&#x201D; (NCCN, 2019h). Acute fatigue serves a protective function, whereas cancer-related fatigue does not. The exact mechanisms of fatigue are not well understood and are multifactorial in nature.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the commonly occurring experience of fatigue in patients with cancer, a reliable assessment tool has not been identified. The experience of fatigue is highly subjective, with patient descriptors varying greatly (NCCN, 2019h). The nurse assesses physiologic and psychological factors that can contribute to fatigue (see <a href="#ct12-8">Chart&#x00A0;12-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Exercise is an effective approach to the management of cancer-related fatigue (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1005">Mitchell, Albrecht, Omar Alkaiyat, et al., 2017</a>). Psychoeducational approaches, cognitive-behavioral therapy to address sleep, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and mindfulness meditation may be effective measures to facilitate fatigue management (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1005">Mitchell et al., 2017</a>). Nurses assist patients with strategies to minimize fatigue or help the patient cope with fatigue as described in the nursing care plan (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>, Fatigue). Occasionally, pharmacologic interventions are utilized, including antidepressants for patients with depression, anxiolytics for those with anxiety, hypnotics for patients with sleep disturbances, and psychostimulants for some patients with advanced cancer or fatigue that does not respond to other interventions (NCCN, 2019h; Mitchell et al., 2017).

<p class="Box2pRef">Overcash, J., Tan, A., &#x0026; Noonan, A. (2018). Factors associated with poor sleep in older women diagnosed with breast cancer. <em>Oncology Nursing Forum, 45</em>(3), 359&#x2013;371.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. The risk for developing breast cancer increases with age, as does the incidence of poor quality of sleep. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship among poor sleep and gait, grip (hand) strength, cognitive status, and symptoms (depression, pain, fatigue).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Women with breast cancer (any stage) aged 69 years or older were recruited to participate in this descriptive, cross-sectional study for an outpatient cancer clinic in the midwestern region of the United States. Instruments used to collect data in this study included: the Timed Up and Go Test (gait), Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer (grip strength), the Mini-Cog (cognitive status), the Geriatric Depression Scale (depression), Numeric Pain Scale (pain), the Brief Fatigue Inventory (fatigue), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (sleep).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Sixty women with breast cancer, with a mean age of 77.6 (range 69.0 to 93.0) years, participated in this study. Strong to moderate relationships were found between pain and fatigue (r = 0.58, <em>p</em> = 0.001); pain and depression (r = 0.40, <em>p</em> = 0.002); and depression and fatigue (r = 0.66, <em>p</em> = 0.001). Patients with greater severity of fatigue (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.32 &#x2013; 2.16]), depression (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.07 &#x2013; 1.99]), and pain (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.04 &#x2013; 1.92]) were found to be at significantly higher risk of having poor sleep. Fatigue was found to have the strongest association with poor sleep. Poor sleep was not significantly related to gait, grip strength, or cognitive status in this study (all <em>p</em>-values &#x003E;&#x00A0; 0.05).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses need to be aware of the symptoms that can affect sleep in older women with breast cancer, both during and following treatment. In this study, fatigue was found to strongly relate to poor sleep, which suggests that nurses must assess for and develop strategies to address both symptom concerns. Nurses should encourage older women with breast cancer to engage in physical activity (exercise) as part of their daily routine, to decrease fatigue and enhance sleep. Given that fatigue, depression, pain, and poor sleep may contribute to an increased risk for falls in older adults, nurses must pay particular attention to safety when caring for women with breast cancer and their families.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s417">Improving Body Image and Self-Esteem</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse identifies potential threats to the patient&#x2019;s body image and assesses the patient&#x2019;s ability to cope with the many bodily changes that may be experienced throughout the course of disease and treatment. Entry into the health care system may be accompanied by depersonalization. Threats to self-concept occur as the patient faces the realization of illness, disfigurement, possible disability, and death. To accommodate treatments or because of the disease, many patients with cancer are forced to alter their lifestyles. Priorities and values change when body image is threatened. Disfiguring surgery, hair loss, cachexia, skin changes, altered communication patterns, and sexual dysfunction can threaten the patient&#x2019;s self-esteem and body image.</p>
<p class="indent">A creative and positive approach is essential when caring for patients with altered body image. Nursing strategies for addressing issues related to body image and self-esteem are included in the nursing care plan (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>). The nurse serves as an active listener and counselor to both the patient and the family. Possible influences of the patient&#x2019;s culture and age are considered when discussing concerns and potential interventions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s418">Addressing Sexuality</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The physiologic processes associated with cancer; potential short- and long-term effects of cancer treatments; and psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual responses to the entire experience may lead patients to confront a variety of sexuality-based issues. Patients at the greatest risk of sexual dysfunction are those with tumors that involve the sexual or pelvic organs and those whose treatment affects the hormonal systems mediating sexual function (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Although sexuality is an important component of overall health, many nurses and other health professionals are hesitant to include sexuality in their discussions with patients (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib939">Almont, Farsi, Krakowski, et al., 2019</a>). In offering a holistic approach to the care of patients with cancer, nurses should initiate discussions about sexuality and assess sexual health.</p>
<p class="indent">Infertility, a common consequence of cancer and cancer treatments, can be of concern to patients and their partners. The potential for impaired fertility is discussed and options reviewed for fertility preservation (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Fertility plans are discussed and determined prior to the initiation of any therapy that may compromise reproductive abilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Referrals are made as needed for specialized evaluation and interventions that are beyond the scope of nursing intervention.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s419">Assisting in the Grieving Process</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A cancer diagnosis need not indicate a fatal outcome. Many forms of cancer are curable, and others may be controlled for long periods of time similar to the course of other chronic diseases. Despite the tremendous advances in cancer treatment, many patients and their families still view cancer as a fatal disease that is inevitably accompanied by pain, suffering, debilitation, and emaciation. Grieving is a normal response to these fears and to actual or potential losses: loss of health, normal sensations, body image, social interaction, intimacy, independence, and usual social roles. Patients, families, and friends may grieve for the loss of quality time to spend with others, the loss of future and unfulfilled plans, and the loss <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page355" title="355"></span>of control over the patient&#x2019;s body and emotional reactions. Nurses continue to assess the patient and family for positive or maladaptive coping behaviors, interpersonal communication, and evidence of the need for additional psychosocial support or interventions such as referral for professional counseling.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient enters the terminal phase of disease, the nurse may assess that the patient and family members are at different stages of grief. In such cases, the nurse assists the patient and family to acknowledge and cope with their reactions and feelings. The nurse also empowers the patient and family to explore preferences for issues related to end-of-life care, such as withdrawal of active disease treatment, desire for the use of life-support measures, and symptom management approaches. Oncology nurses respectfully support the patient&#x2019;s spiritual or religious views and facilitate contact with their preferred clergy member, if desired. In addition, nurses consider the patient&#x2019;s cultural beliefs and practices when addressing issues related to grief. After the death of a patient with cancer, home health or hospice nurses follow up with surviving family members for bereavement counseling to facilitate expression and coping with feelings of loss and grief. (See <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for further discussion of end-of-life issues.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s420">Management of Psychosocial Distress</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Despite advances in cancer care, patients experience varying levels of psychosocial distress related to actual or potential losses, fear of the unknown, symptoms due to cancer or cancer treatments, changes in usual family and social roles, financial concerns, and a sense of loss of control. Psychosocial distress is defined as a multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioral, emotional), social, or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to cope effectively with cancer, its physical symptoms and its treatment (NCCN, 2019i). Distress occurs along a continuum, ranging from common normal feelings of vulnerability, sadness, and fears to problems that can become disabling, such as depression, anxiety, panic, social isolation, and existential and spiritual crisis. Distress that is not addressed can have a significant impact on the overall well-being, interpersonal relationships, cognitive abilities, and adherence to treatment regimens, leading to poor outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses need to screen patients for psychosocial distress during the cancer experience. Patients are supported in managing various sources and levels of distress. Referral to mental health providers may be helpful to address specific concerns (NCCN, 2019i).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s421">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses need to pay particular attention to monitoring for and helping manage complications such as infection, septic shock, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For patients in all stages of cancer, the nurse assesses factors associated with the development of infection. Although infection-associated morbidity and mortality have greatly decreased, prevention and prompt treatment of infection are essential in patients with cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Often, more than one predisposing factor is present in patients with cancer. The nurse monitors laboratory studies to detect early changes in WBC counts. Common sites of infection, such as the pharynx, skin, perianal area, urinary, and respiratory tracts, are assessed on a regular basis. However, the typical signs of infection (swelling, redness, drainage, and pain) may not occur in myelosuppressed patients because of decreased circulating WBCs and a diminished local inflammatory response. Fever may be the only sign of infection (NCCN, 2019j). The nurse monitors the patient for sepsis, particularly if invasive catheters or long-term IV catheters are in place.</p>
<p class="indent">WBC function is often impaired in patients with cancer. Among the five types of WBCs (neutrophils [granulocytes], lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils), neutrophils serve as the body&#x2019;s primary initial defense against invading organisms. Comprising 60% to 70% of the body&#x2019;s WBCs, neutrophils act by engulfing and destroying infective organisms through phagocytosis. Both the total WBC count and the concentration of neutrophils are important in determining the patient&#x2019;s ability to fight infection. A decrease in circulating WBCs is referred to as leukopenia. The terms granulocytopenia and neutropenia refer to a decrease in neutrophils.</p>
<p class="indent">A differential WBC count identifies the relative numbers of WBCs and permits tabulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) or segmented neutrophils (mature neutrophils, reported as &#x201C;polys,&#x201D; PMNs, or &#x201C;segs&#x201D;) and immature forms of neutrophils (reported as bands, metamyelocytes, and &#x201C;stabs&#x201D;). The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is calculated by the following formula:</p>
<p class="center2"><img src="images/355-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Neutropenia, an abnormally low ANC, is associated with an increased risk of infection. The risk of infection rises as the ANC decreases. As the ANC declines below 1500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the risk of infection rises. An ANC less than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> reflects a severe risk of infection (NCCN, 2019j). The <strong><em>nadir</em></strong> is the lowest ANC following chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation therapy that suppresses bone marrow function. Severe neutropenia may necessitate delays in administration of myelosuppressive therapies or treatment dose adjustments, although the use of the hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., colony-stimulating factors; see previous discussion) has reduced the severity and duration of treatment-associated neutropenia as well as infection-related morbidity and early death (NCCN, 2019j). The administration of these growth factors assists in maintaining treatment schedules, drug dosages, treatment effectiveness, and quality of life.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with febrile neutropenia are assessed for factors that increase the risk of infection and for sources of infection through cultures of blood, sputum, urine, stool, IV and urinary or other catheters, and wounds, if appropriate (see <a href="#tt12-10">Table&#x00A0;12-10</a>). In addition, a chest x-ray is usually obtained to assess for pulmonary infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Defense against infection is compromised in many ways. The integrity of the skin and mucous membranes is challenged by multiple invasive diagnostic procedures, by the adverse effects of all cancer treatment modalities, and by the detrimental effects of immobility. Impaired nutrition as a result of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page356" title="356"></span>CACS, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the underlying disease alters the body&#x2019;s ability to combat invading organisms. Medications such as antibiotics disturb the balance of normal flora, allowing the overgrowth of normal flora and pathogenic organisms. Other medications can also alter the immune response (see <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>). Cancer itself may lead to defects in cellular and humoral immunity. Advanced cancer may cause obstruction of hollow viscera (e.g., intestines), blood, and lymphatic vessels, creating a favorable environment for proliferation of pathogenic organisms. In some patients, tumor cells infiltrate bone marrow and prevent normal production of WBCs.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Nurses are in a key position to assist in preventing and identifying symptoms of infection, as discussed in the nursing care plan (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>). Clinical practice guidelines developed by the ONS, the Infusion Nurses Society (INS), the NCCN, and the ASCO are used to guide prevention and management of infection. Interventions to prevent infection and alternative patient education formats for infection-related instruction are high nursing research priorities.</p>
<p class="indent">Gram-positive bacteria (<em>Streptococcus,</em> enterococci, and <em>Staphylococcus</em> species) and gram-negative organisms (<em>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter,</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) are the most frequently isolated causes of infection. Fungal organisms, such as <em>Candida albicans,</em> also contribute to the incidence of serious infection. Viral infections in immunocompromised patients are caused most often by herpes simplex, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and influenza A and B viruses.</p>
<p class="indent">Fever is reported promptly as it is an important sign of infection in patients when associated with neutropenia (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Patients with neutropenic fever (see <a href="#tt12-10">Table&#x00A0;12-10</a>) are assessed for infection and reported promptly (NCCN, 2019j). Antibiotics may be prescribed after cultures of wound drainage, exudates, sputum, urine, stool, or blood are obtained. Careful consideration is given to the underlying malignancy, prior antineoplastic treatment, ANC, comorbidities, and other patient-related factors prior to the identification of the most appropriate antibiotic therapy. Evidence-based guidelines are available for prevention and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page357" title="357"></span>treatment of cancer-related infections (NCCN, 2019j). Patients with neutropenia are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics before the infecting organism is identified because of the increased risk of mortality associated with untreated infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy targets the most likely major pathogenic organisms. It is important for these medications to be given and taken promptly as scheduled to achieve adequate blood levels. Once the offending organism is identified, more specific antimicrobial therapy is prescribed as appropriate. Nurses provide education for patients and families regarding prevention of infection, signs and symptoms to report, and the importance of adherence to prescribed antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6"> <img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Septic Shock</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses the patient frequently for signs and symptoms of infection and inflammation throughout the trajectory of cancer care. Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening complications that must be prevented or detected and treated promptly. Although all patients with cancer are at risk, patients who are neutropenic or who have hematologic malignancies are at the greatest risk. Patients with signs and symptoms of impending sepsis and septic shock require immediate hospitalization and aggressive treatment in the intensive care setting. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for discussion of sepsis and septic shock.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bleeding and Thrombocytopenia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Platelets are essential for normal blood clotting and coagulation (hemostasis). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thrombocytopenia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in the number of circulating platelets; associated with the potential for bleeding">Thrombocytopenia</button></strong>, a decrease in the circulating platelet count, is the most common cause of bleeding in patients with cancer and is usually defined as a platelet count less than 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>12</sup>/L). The risk of bleeding increases when the platelet count decreases below 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.05 &#x00D7; 10<sup>12</sup>/L). At platelet counts lower than 10,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.02 &#x00D7; 10<sup>12</sup>/L), the risk for spontaneous bleeding is increased (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Thrombocytopenia often results from bone marrow depression after certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and with tumor infiltration of the bone marrow. In some cases, platelet destruction is associated with hypersplenism (enlarged spleen) and abnormal antibody function, which occur with leukemia and lymphoma. Bacterial and viral infections may lead to early platelet destruction or impaired bone marrow production of platelets and subsequent thrombocytopenia. Some medications (e.g., heparin, vancomycin) may cause bone marrow toxicity leading to decreases in circulating platelets. Less commonly, posttransfusion complications may lead to antibody destruction of platelets causing profound thrombocytopenia (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Mones &#x0026; Soff, 2019</a>). The nursing care plan addresses nursing assessment parameters and interventions for patients at risk for bleeding (see <a href="#ct12-6">Chart&#x00A0;12-6</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Although laboratory test results confirm the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia, the patient who is developing thrombocytopenia may display early signs and symptoms. Thus, nurses need to observe keenly for petechiae and ecchymoses, which are early indicators of decreasing platelet levels. Early detection promotes early intervention.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Additional medications may be prescribed to address bleeding or thrombocytopenia based on the underlying etiology. See <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for further discussion of assessment and treatment of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies.</p>
<p class="indent">VTE, a common problem for patients with cancer, includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), superficial venous thrombosis (SVT), and thrombosis in other abdominal or thoracic venous tributaries such as the mesenteric veins or the superior vena cava. The incidence of VTE has been linked to an increased likelihood of death in patients with cancer (NCCN, 2019k). Factors associated with risk for VTEs in cancer patients include preexisting underlying or cancer-related coagulopathies, medications including chemotherapy, hospitalizations, surgical procedures, increased age, debilitation, immobility, infection, and peripheral and central venous catheters (NCCN, 2019k). Patients with cancer are monitored for associated risk factors and are assessed on an ongoing basis for VTE. Nurses provide patient and family education regarding symptoms of VTE to report to the provider. Recommendations for prophylaxis are based on national guidelines and patient risk factors. Nursing assessment findings associated with VTE are reported promptly so that VTE evaluation and treatment can be initiated expeditiously.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most commonly, patients with cancer are diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Nurses in outpatient settings often have the responsibility for patient education and helping coordinate care in the home (see <a href="#ct12-10">Chart&#x00A0;12-10</a>). The shift of care from acute care facilities to the home or outpatient settings as well as the increasing use of oral antineoplastic agents places significant responsibility for care on the patient and family. In order to maintain optimal patient outcomes and quality of life, patients and families require support and information that will prepare them to engage in self-care. Education initially focuses on the most immediate care needs likely to be encountered at home.</p>
<p class="indent">Approaches to preparing patients for self-care responsibilities are chosen with consideration of the patient&#x2019;s preferred learning strategies, level of education, and health literacy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib984">Howell, Harth, Brown, et al., 2017</a>). Nurses are in a prime role to promote self-care by ensuring that the educational needs of patients and families are met across time points of the cancer continuum (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib974">Eller, Lev, Yuan, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1055">White, Cohen, Berger, et al., 2017</a>). Easily understood, concrete, objective information that assists patients to understand what to expect and includes sensory and temporal components is important. Symptoms, side effects of treatment, and changes in the patient&#x2019;s status that should be reported are discussed and reinforced with printed materials that can be referred to in the home. Nurses help to empower patients by sharing strategies to manage side effects or other symptoms. Additional learning needs are based on the priorities conveyed by the patient and family as well as on the complexity of care required (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Howell et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Technologic advances allow home administration of IV chemotherapy, blood products, and antibiotics; enteral or parenteral nutrition; and parenteral analgesics. Patients and families are taught to care for vascular access devices, infusion pumps, various types of drainage catheters, and on occasion complex wounds. The importance of patient safety and infection control is included in patient and family education. Although nurses are often available to provide some assistance with cancer care in the home, patients and families need to acquire the requisite knowledge and skills that will enable them to develop a strong sense of self-efficacy to not only foster self-care, but also to promote a more positive health status and better quality of life (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Eller et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">White et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuing and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Referral for home or transitional care is often indicated for patients with cancer. The responsibilities of the nurse include assessing the home environment and suggesting modifications in the home or in care to help address the patient&#x2019;s physical and safety needs. Home health nurses also assess the psychosocial impact of cancer on the patient and family so that appropriate interventions can be identified or referrals for support services are instituted.</p>
<p class="indent">Ongoing nursing visits or phone contact from the home or transitional care nurse assist in prevention, early identification, prompt reporting, and management of patient problems. Timely modifications in therapy to manage symptoms and adverse effects of treatment may decrease patient suffering and decrease emergency department visits or hospital admissions. Continued contact facilitates evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s progress, responses to treatment, and assessment of the ongoing needs of the patient and family. It is necessary to assess the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s understanding of the treatment plan and management strategies and to reinforce previous education. The nurse facilitates coordination of patient care by maintaining close communication with all involved health care providers. The nurse may make referrals and coordinate available community resources (e.g., local office of the ACS, home aides, church groups, faith community nurses, support groups) to assist patients and caregivers.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s423"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 55% of cancer incidence and 70% of cancer deaths occur in persons aged 65 years or older (ACS, 2019a). The rising number of individuals over age 65 with cancer has led to the emergence of geriatric oncology, a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach to treating growing numbers of older adults with cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses working with older adults must understand the normal physiologic changes that occur with aging and the implications for the patient with cancer (see <a href="#tt12-11">Table&#x00A0;12-11</a>). These changes that affect all body systems may ultimately influence older patients&#x2019; responses to cancer treatment. In addition, many older patients have other chronic diseases requiring multiple medications. The existence of comorbidities and multiple medications may contribute to drug interactions and toxicities in older patients.</p>
<p class="indent">The understanding of the effects and tolerance of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and radiation in the older adult is limited, as older adults have been underrepresented in oncology clinical trials. Potential chemotherapy-related toxicities, such as renal impairment, myelosuppression, fatigue, and cardiomyopathy, may increase as a result of declining organ function and diminished physiologic reserves. The recovery of normal tissues after radiation therapy may be delayed, and older adult patients may experience more severe adverse effects, such as mucositis, nausea and vomiting, and myelosuppression. Because of impaired healing and declining pulmonary and cardiovascular functioning, older patients are slower to recover from surgery. Older patients are also at increased risk for complications, such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and wound infections.</p>
