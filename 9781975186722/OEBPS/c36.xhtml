<p class="nonindent">Musculoskeletal disorders, particularly impairment of the back, joints, and spine, are leading health problems and causes of disability. The functional and psychological limitations for the patient may be severe. Nurses should be cognizant of these limitations and the effects these disorders may have on these patients when providing care in inpatient and outpatient settings.</p>
