<h4 class="h4" id="s166">Additional Aspects of Health Care of the Older Adult</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse needs to consider other health issues of older adults. These include geriatric syndromes, elder neglect and abuse, as well as ethical and legal issues.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s167">Geriatric Syndromes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults tend to acquire multiple problems and illnesses as they age. The decline of physical function leads to a loss of independence and increasing frailty as well as to susceptibility to both acute and chronic health problems, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page187" title="187"></span>generally result from several factors rather than from a single cause. When combined with a decrease in host resistance, these factors can lead to illness or injury. Some problems commonly experienced by older adults are becoming recognized as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;geriatric syndromes:&lt;/b&gt; common conditions found in older adults that tend to be multifactorial and do not fall under discrete disease categories; these conditions include falls, delirium, frailty, dizziness, and urinary incontinence">geriatric syndromes</button></strong>. These conditions do not fit into discrete disease categories and require a multidisciplinary and comprehensive assessment to identify the underlying cause or causes. Examples include skin impairment (e.g., pressure injuries), poor nutrition, falls or functional decline, urinary incontinence, defecation incontinence, cognitive impairment (e.g., delirium), and sleep disturbances (<a href="#bib580">Tang, Tang, Hu, et al., 2017</a>). Although these conditions may develop slowly, the onset of symptoms is often acute. Furthermore, the presenting symptoms may appear in other body systems before becoming apparent in the affected system. For example, an older patient may present with confusion, and the underlying disease may be a UTI, dehydration, or a heart attack (<a href="#bib582">van Seben, Reichardt, Aarden, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The term <em>geriatric triad</em> includes changes in cognitive status, falls, and incontinence. This term is used to focus awareness on these three conditions, which need particular attention, and the implementation of prevention measures during the hospitalization of older patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Impaired Mobility</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The causes of decreased mobility are many and varied. Common causes include strokes, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, diabetic neuropathy, cardiovascular compromise, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and sensory deficits. To avoid immobility, older people should be encouraged to stay as active as possible. During illness, bed rest should be kept to a minimum, even with hospitalized patients, because brief periods of bed rest quickly lead to deconditioning and, consequently, to a wide range of complications. When bed rest cannot be avoided, patients should perform active range-of-motion and strengthening exercises with the unaffected extremities, and nurses or family caregivers should perform passive range-of-motion exercises on the affected extremities. Frequent position changes help offset the hazards of immobility. Both the health care staff and the patient&#x2019;s family can assist in maintaining the current level of mobility.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dizziness</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults frequently seek help for dizziness, which presents a particular challenge because there are numerous possible causes. For many, the problem is complicated by an inability to differentiate between true dizziness (a sensation of disorientation in relation to position) and vertigo (a spinning sensation). Other similar sensations include near-syncope and disequilibrium. The causes for these sensations range in severity from minor (e.g., buildup of ear wax) to severe (e.g., dysfunction of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, proprioceptive receptors, or vestibular system). Even a minor reversible cause, such as ear wax impaction, can result in a loss of balance and a subsequent fall and injury. Because dizziness has many predisposing factors, nurses should seek to identify any potentially treatable factors related to the condition.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Falls and Falling</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Inadvertent injuries rank third as a cause of death for older people, and falls are the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions. The incidence of falls rises with increasing age.</p>
<p class="indent">Many older adults who fall do not sustain an injury; however, between 20% and 30% of older adults who fall sustain moderate to serious injury such as bruises, hip fractures, or head trauma. One out of five falls in older adults results in serious injury such as broken bones or a head injury (<a href="#bib606">Heron, 2019</a>). Overall, older women who fall sustain a greater degree of injury than do older men; however, men are more likely to die of a fall injury (<a href="#bib585">World Health Organization [WHO], 2019</a>). Hip fracture is a common type of fracture that can occur as a result of a fall. Fifty percent of adults who fall but cannot get up on their own and sustain a hip fracture are then unable to return to the same functional level after this type of injury. Causes of falls are multifactorial. Both extrinsic factors such as changes in the environment or poor lighting and intrinsic factors such as physical illness, neurologic changes, or sensory impairment play a role. Mobility difficulties, medication effects, foot problems or unsafe footwear, orthostatic hypotension, visual problems, and tripping hazards are common and treatable causes. Polypharmacy, medication interactions, and the use of alcohol precipitate falls by causing drowsiness, decreased coordination, and orthostatic hypotension. Falls have physical dangers as well as serious psychological and social consequences. It is not uncommon for an older person who has experienced a fall to become fearful and lose self-confidence (<a href="#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses can encourage older adults and their families to make lifestyle and environmental changes to prevent falls. Adequate lighting with minimal glare and shadow can be achieved through the use of small area lamps, indirect lighting, sheer curtains to diffuse direct sunlight, dull rather than shiny surfaces, and nightlights. Sharply contrasting colors can be used to mark the edges of stairs. Grab bars by the bathtub, shower, and toilet are useful. Loose clothing, improperly fitting shoes, scatter rugs, small objects, and pets create hazards and increase the risk of falls. Older adults function best in familiar settings when the arrangement of furniture and objects remains unchanged.</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>In hospitalized and institutionalized older adults, physical restraints (lap belts; geriatric chairs; side rails, vest, waist, and jacket restraints) and chemical restraints (medications) precipitate many of the injuries they were meant to prevent. Because of the acute negative consequences of restraint use, accrediting agencies of nursing homes and acute care facilities now maintain stringent guidelines for correct application and use.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Urinary Incontinence</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Urinary incontinence may be acute, occurring during an illness, or may develop chronically over a period of years. Older patients often do not report this very common problem unless specifically asked. Transient causes may be attributed to <em>d</em>elirium and <em>d</em>ehydration; <em>r</em>estricted mobility; <em>i</em>nflammation, <em>i</em>nfection, and <em>i</em>mpaction; and <em>p</em>harmaceuticals and <em>p</em>olyuria (the acronym <em>drip</em> may be used to remember them). Once identified, the causative factor can be eliminated.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 187</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page188" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="188">p. 188</span></div>
<p class="indent">Older patients with incontinence should be urged to seek help from appropriate health care providers because incontinence can be both emotionally devastating and physically debilitating. Nurses who specialize in behavioral approaches to urinary incontinence management can help patients regain full continence or significantly improve the level of continence. Although medications such as anticholinergics may decrease some of the symptoms of urge incontinence (detrusor instability), the adverse effects of these medications (dry mouth, slowed GI motility, and confusion) may make them inappropriate choices for older adults (<a href="#bib606">Fick et al., 2019</a>). Various surgical procedures are also used to manage urinary incontinence, particularly stress urinary incontinence.</p>
<p class="indent">Detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility is a type of urge incontinence that is seen predominantly in the older adult population. In this variation of urge incontinence, patients have no warning that they are about to urinate. They often void only a small volume of urine or none at all and then experience a large volume of incontinence after leaving the bathroom. Nurses should be familiar with this form of incontinence and not show disapproval when it occurs. Many patients with dementia suffer from this type of incontinence, because both incontinence and dementia are a result of dysfunction in similar areas of the brain. Prompted, timed voiding can be of assistance in these patients, although clean intermittent catheterization may be necessary because of postvoid residual urine. See <a href="c49.xhtml">Chapter 49</a> for information on management of urinary disorders.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Increased Susceptibility to Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Infectious diseases present a significant threat of morbidity and mortality to older adults, in part because of the blunted response of host defenses caused by a reduction in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity (see <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;31</a> and <a href="c32.xhtml">32</a>). Age-related loss of physiologic reserve and chronic illnesses also contribute to increased susceptibility. Pneumonia, UTIs, GI infections, and skin infections are some of the common infections in older adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of a weakened immune response, the effects of influenza and pneumococcal infections on older adults are significant. Vaccination can help prevent both infections. There is a national goal to increase vaccination rates among people 65 years of age and older. More than 71% of those 65 years of age and older reported receiving an influenza vaccination between January and June 2018 and 69% reported that they had received a pneumococcal vaccination (AoA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations lower the risks of hospitalization and death in older adults. The influenza vaccine, which is prepared yearly to adjust for the specific immunologic characteristics of the influenza viruses at that time, should be given annually in autumn. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose influenza vaccine suggests that better protection is provided with the high-dose, trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine versus the standard vaccine in older adults (<a href="#bib570">Lee, Lam, Shin, et al., 2018</a>). The pneumococcal vaccine should be administered as recommended (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="c03-sec05.xhtml#tt3-3">Table&#x00A0;3-3</a>). Both of these injections can be received at the same time in separate injection sites. Nurses should urge older adults to be vaccinated. All health care providers working with older adults or high-risk chronically ill people should also be immunized.</p>
<p class="indent">AIDS occurs across the age spectrum. It is increasingly recognized that AIDS does not spare the older segment of society, and many who are living with HIV/AIDS are aging.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Atypical Responses</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many altered physical, emotional, and systemic reactions to disease are attributed to age-related changes in older adults. Physical indicators of illness that are useful and reliable in young and middle-aged people cannot be relied on for the diagnosis of potential life-threatening problems in older adults. The response to pain in older adults may be lessened because of reduced acuity of touch, alterations in neural pathways, and diminished processing of sensory data.</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults who are experiencing an MI may not have chest pain but present with confusion. Hiatal hernia or upper GI distress is often the cause of chest pain. Therefore, acute abdominal conditions may go unrecognized in older adults because of atypical signs and absence of pain.</p>
<p class="indent">The baseline body temperature for older adults is about 1&#x00B0;F lower than it is for younger people (<a href="#bib606">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2019</a>). In the event of illness, the body temperature of an older person may not be high enough to qualify as a traditionally defined fever. A temperature of 37.8&#x00B0;C (100&#x00B0;F) in combination with systemic symptoms may signal infection. A temperature of 38.3&#x00B0;C (101&#x00B0;F) almost certainly indicates a serious infection that needs prompt attention. A blunted fever in the face of an infection often indicates a poor prognosis. Temperatures rarely exceed 39.5&#x00B0;C (103&#x00B0;F). Nurses must be alert to other subtle signs of infection, such as mental confusion, increased respirations, tachycardia, and a change in skin color.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Altered Emotional Impact</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The emotional component of illness in older adults may differ from that in younger people. Many older adults equate good health with the ability to perform their daily activities and believe that &#x201C;you are as old as you feel.&#x201D; An illness that requires hospitalization or a change in lifestyle is an imminent threat to well-being. Older adults admitted to the hospital are at high risk for disorientation, confusion, change in level of consciousness, and other symptoms of delirium, as well as anxiety and fear. In addition, economic concerns and fear of becoming a burden to families often lead to high anxiety in older adults. Nurses must recognize the implications of fear, anxiety, and dependency in older patients. They should encourage autonomy, independent decision making, and early mobilization. A positive and confident demeanor in nurses and family members promotes a positive mental outlook in older patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Altered Systemic Response</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In an older person, illness has far-reaching repercussions. The decline in organ function that occurs in every system of the aging body eventually depletes the body&#x2019;s ability to respond at full capacity. Illness places new demands on body systems that have little or no reserve to meet the crisis. Homeostasis is jeopardized. Older adults may be unable to respond effectively to an acute illness or, if a chronic health condition is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page189" title="189"></span>present, they may be unable to sustain appropriate responses over a long period. Furthermore, their ability to respond to definitive treatment is impaired. The altered responses of older adults reinforce the need for nurses to monitor all body system functions closely, being alert to signs of impending systemic complication.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s168">Elder Neglect and Abuse</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults are at risk for abuse and neglect both in the community setting and in nursing homes (<a href="#bib606">Burnes, Pillemer, &#x0026; Lachs, 2017</a>). Because of different definitions and terminology and the pattern of underreporting, a clear picture of the incidence and prevalence of abuse among older adults is lacking. Furthermore, one of the major barriers to fully understanding elder abuse is that most professionals in all professions, including law enforcement, are not equipped to recognize and report this type of abuse. Often victims are reluctant to report the abuse and clinicians are unaware of the frequency of the problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Neglect is the most common type of abuse. Other forms of abuse include physical, psychological or emotional, sexual, abandonment, and financial exploitation or abuse. Burnes and colleagues (2017) reported factors associated with physical and emotional abuse included being separated or divorced, living in a low-income household, functional impairment, and younger age for community-dwelling older adults. Neglect was associated with poor health, living below the poverty level, being separated or divorced, and younger age. Neglect was lowest in Hispanic households (<a href="#bib606">Burnes et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Physical abuse associated with staff misconduct in long-term care facilities has received much attention in the past decade. Braaten and Malmedal (2017) did a qualitative study to understand the perspective of staff regarding prevention of physical abuse of nursing home residents. Staff were asked what measures they considered useful to implement in their daily work to prevent abusive behaviors. Staff shared that there was a need for increased competence among staff about the concept of abuse, known risk factors, good communication skills, and trusting relationships, as well as a work environment/culture that promotes openness where ethical dilemmas can be discussed (<a href="#bib606">Braaten &#x0026; Malmedal, 2017</a>). Factors associated with resident on resident abuse in a nursing home setting were reported as previous staff physical or emotional abuse; younger age; limitations in ADLs and IADLs; and the emotional closeness of the resident to their family (<a href="#bib606">Braaten &#x0026; Malmedal, 2017</a>). Older adults with disability of all types are at increased risk for abuse from family members, paid caregivers, and staff, whether they live in the community or a long-term care facility.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should be alert to possible <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;elder abuse:&lt;/b&gt; the physical, emotional, or financial harm to an older person by one or more of the person&#x2019;s children, caregivers, or others; includes neglect">elder abuse</button></strong> and neglect. During the health history, the older adult should be asked about abuse during a private portion of the interview. Most states require that care providers, including nurses, report suspected abuse. Preventive action should be taken when caregiver strain is evident&#x2014;before elder abuse occurs. Early detection and intervention may provide sufficient resources to the family or the person at risk to ensure patient safety. Interdisciplinary team members, including the psychologist, social worker, or chaplain, can be enlisted to help the caregiver develop self-awareness, increased insight, and an understanding of the disease or aging process. Community resources such as caregiver support groups, respite services, and local offices of Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) are useful for both the older adult and the caregiver.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s169">Social Services</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many social programs exist for older Americans, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security amendments, Section 202 housing, and Title XX social services legislation. These federal programs have increased health care options and financial support for older Americans. The Older Americans Act mandated creation of a federal aging network, resulting in the establishment of the AAAs, a national system of social services and networks providing many community services for older adults. Each state has an advisory network that is charged with overseeing statewide planning and advocacy for older adults throughout the state. Among the services provided by the AAAs are assessment of need, information and referral, case management, transportation, outreach, homemaker services, day care, nutritional education and congregate meals, legal services, respite care, senior centers, and part-time community work. The agencies target low-income, ethnic minority, rural living, and frail older adults who are at risk for institutionalization; however, the assessment and information services are available to all older adults. Similar services such as homemaker, home health aide, and chore services can be obtained at an hourly rate through these agencies or through local community nursing services if the family does not meet the low-income criteria. Informal sources of help, such as family, friends, mail carriers, church members, and neighbors, all keep an informal watch on community-dwelling senior citizens. (See Resources section at the end of the chapter.)</p>
<p class="indent">Other community support services are available to help older adults outside the home. Senior centers have social and health promotion activities, and some provide a nutritious noontime meal. Adult day care facilities offer daily supervision and social opportunities for older adults who cannot be left alone. Adult day care services, although expensive, provide respite and enable family members to carry on daily activities while the older person is at the day care center.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s170">Health Care Costs of Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Health care is a major expenditure for older adults, especially for those with chronic illness and limited financial resources. Older adults, who make up about 15% of the population, accounted for 38% of health care costs, particularly in the last year of life (<a href="#bib559">Centers for Medicaid &#x0026; Medicare Services [CMS], 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The two major programs that finance health care in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid, both of which are overseen by the CMS. Both programs cover acute care needs such as inpatient hospitalization, primary provider care, outpatient care, home health services, and skilled nursing care in a nursing facility. Medicare is federally funded, whereas <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page190" title="190"></span>Medicaid is given by states; therefore, eligibility and reimbursements for Medicaid services vary from state to state. For older adults with limited incomes, even with the support of Medicare or Medicaid, paying out-of-pocket expenses can be a hardship. Out-of-pocket health care expenses represent 28% of the income of poor and near-poor older adults. Despite changes to the Medicare prescription benefit plan, out-of-pocket expenditures and prescription costs can be burdensome (AoA, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s171">Home Health Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The use of home care services and skilled nursing home care increases with age. Because of the rapidly growing older adult population and the availability of Medicare funding for acute care, home health care in the United States has rapidly expanded. (See <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> for more information on home health care.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s172">Hospice Services</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hospice and palliative care have much in common. Both are for people with serious illnesses. Both follow treatment goals that aim to relieve pain, increase comfort, and improve quality of life for the patient and family. The goal of hospice is to improve the quality of life by focusing on symptom management, pain control, and emotional support. In most hospice cases, patients are not expected to live longer than 6 months. Hospice care focuses on quality of life, and by necessity, it usually includes realistic emotional, social, spiritual, and financial preparation for death. Palliative care is for people at any stage of a serious illness, and their condition does not have to be incurable. Palliative care aims to relieve pain and other symptoms to maintain the highest quality of life for the longest period of time (<a href="#bib606">Casey, 2019</a>). Under Medicare and Medicaid, medical and nursing services are provided to keep patients as pain free and comfortable as possible. (For an in-depth discussion of palliative and end-of-life care, see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s173">Aging With a Disability</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As the life expectancy of people with all types of physical, cognitive, and mental disability has increased, individuals must deal with the normal changes associated with aging in addition to their preexisting disability. There are still large gaps in our understanding of the interaction between disability and aging, including how this interaction varies depending on the type and degree of disability and other factors such as socioeconomics and gender. For adults without disability, the changes associated with aging may be minor inconveniences. For adults with disorders such as spinal cord injuries, aging is associated with higher rates of secondary health conditions compared to those aging without a disability (<a href="#bib606">Jorgensen, Iwarsson, &#x0026; Lexell, 2019</a>). Many people with disability are greatly concerned about what will happen to them as they age and whether assistance will be available when they need care.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been proposed that nurses view people with disability as capable, responsible individuals who are able to function effectively despite having a disability. Both the Interface and the Biopsychosocial models of disability can serve as a basis for the role of nurses as advocates for removal of barriers to health care. The use of such models would also encourage public policies that support full participation of all citizens through greater availability of personal assistants and affordable and accessible transportation. See <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="c07-sec01.xhtml#ct7-2">Chart&#x00A0;7-2</a> for discussion of other disability models.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, children born with intellectual and physical disability and those who acquire them early in life are also living into middle and older age. Often, their care has been provided by the family, primarily by the parents. As parents age and can no longer provide the needed care, they seek additional help with the care or long-term care alternatives for their children. However, few services are available at present to support a smooth transition between caregiving by parents and then by others. Research and public policy must focus on supports and interventions that allow people with disability who are aging to increase or maintain function within their personal environment as well as in the outside community. Important questions include who will provide the care and how will it be financed. The National Institute on Aging has identified aging with a disability as a focus and is striving to provide streamlined information and access to those with a disability and their family caregivers.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s174">Ethical and Legal Issues Affecting the Older Adult</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses play an important role in supporting and informing patients and families when making treatment decisions. This nursing role becomes even more important in the care of aging patients who are facing life-altering and possibly end-of-life decisions. Loss of rights, victimization, and other serious problems might occur if a patient has not made plans for personal and property management in the event of disability or death. As advocates, nurses should encourage end-of-life discussions and educate older adults to prepare advance directives before incapacitation (<a href="#bib606">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An advance directive is a formal, legally endorsed document that provides instructions for care (living will) or names a proxy decision maker (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;durable power of attorney:&lt;/b&gt; a formal, legally endorsed document that identifies a proxy decision maker who can make decisions if the signer becomes incapacitated">durable power of attorney</button></strong>). It is to be implemented if the signer becomes incapacitated. This written document must be signed by the person and by two witnesses, and a copy should be given to the primary provider and placed in the medical record. The advance directive is not meant to be used only when certain (or all) types of medical treatment are withheld; rather, it allows for a description of health care preferences, including requesting full use of all available medical interventions. The health care proxy may have the authority to interpret the patient&#x2019;s wishes on the basis of medical circumstances and should be guided by the decisions or situations stated in the living will (see <a href="#ct8-8">Chart&#x00A0;8-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When such serious decisions are made, possibilities exist for significant conflict of values among patients, family members, health care providers, and the legal representative. Autonomy and self-determination are Western concepts, and people from different cultures may view advance directives as a method for denial of care. Older adults from some cultures <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page191" title="191"></span>may be unwilling to consider the future, or they may wish to protect relatives and not want them to be informed about a serious illness. Nurses can facilitate the decision making process by being sensitive to the complexity of patients&#x2019; values and respecting their decisions. Directives must be focused on the wishes of the patient, not those of the family or the designated proxy.</p>

<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct8-8"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;8-8 <img class="m" src="images/icon55.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Does Stopping of Eating and Drinking Violate the Principle of Nonmaleficence?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You work as a staff nurse in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer care unit. C.R. is an 82-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease who has been a resident in the facility for over a year. Her status has deteriorated significantly over the past 2 months. C.R.&#x2019;s daughter has been visiting her mother at dinnertime most evenings, bringing her favorite foods and drinks to feed her by hand. One evening, C.R.&#x2019;s son visits during dinnertime and finds his sister feeding their mother. This was the first time C.R.&#x2019;s son has visited her in over 2 months. He reacts angrily, noting that C.R. had noted in her advance directive that she did not wish to receive nutrition and fluids if she became incapacitated. He admonishes his sister &#x201C;Mom does not even recognize either one of us&#x2014;she would not want to keep going on this way!&#x201D; C.R.&#x2019;s daughter notes that although their mother does not recognize anyone or understand what is happening, she opens her mouth and seems to enjoy the food and fluids that she is receiving. C.R.&#x2019;s son is his mother&#x2019;s sole designated proxy; he was authorized by her with her power-of-attorney to make health care decisions during a time when she had the mental capacity to make that decision. He reminds you and C.R.&#x2019;s daughter of this, and tells you that he wants his sister to stop giving food and fluids to his mother.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Whether or not a patient may autonomously decide to forego artificial nutrition and hydration therapy (ANH) is not subject to much debate at present. Most bioethicists tend to agree that a patient with mental capacity may decide to forego ANH, even if doing so may hasten the patient&#x2019;s death. Advance directives for health care that specify no ANH written by patients before such time as they lose capacity is considered binding. Proxy decision makers for patients who lose capacity may also make the decision to withhold ANH.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">However, decisions to voluntarily stop eating and drinking (VSED), or taking nutrition and fluids by the &#x201C;natural&#x201D; oral route, can be more complicated. While ANH may only be delivered using medical interventions (e.g., intravenous fluids, feeding tubes), taking food and fluids orally might not be considered &#x201C;medical care.&#x201D; In these instances, whether or not a designated proxy or person vested with power-of-attorney for health care agrees that this type of feeding can continue may be inconsequential. The ANA (2017) declares that &#x201C;VSED, with the intention of hastening death can only be made by those patients with decision making capacity, not by surrogates.&#x201D; (p.1). In that same position statement, however, the ANA (2017) also states that &#x201C;the patient&#x2019;s decision regarding VSED remains binding, even if the patient subsequently loses capacity.&#x201D; (p.1). It is important for a person who wishes to VSED to specify that in an advance directive.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>). Which principle do you believe should have preeminence as you proceed to work with C.R. and her adult children? Does VSED in a patient who now lacks capacity violate the principle of nonmaleficence?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is C.R.&#x2019;s son authorized to specify that his sister may not hand feed their mother? What if C.R.&#x2019;s advance directive specifically states that, should she lose capacity, she would not wish to receive <em>oral</em> food and fluids? C.R. opens her mouth and willingly accepts the foods and fluids given to her by her daughter; does this imply that she now consents to be hand fed?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be available to you and the health care team to help C.R.&#x2019;s adult children determine what is in her best interests?</p>

<p class="indent">If no advance arrangement has been made and the older person appears unable to make decisions, the court may be petitioned for a competency hearing. If the court rules that an older adult is incompetent, the judge appoints a guardian&#x2014;a third party who is given powers by the court to assume responsibility for making financial or personal decisions for that person.</p>
<p class="indent">People with communication difficulties or mild dementia tend to be viewed as incapable of self-determination. However, people with mild dementia may have sufficient cognitive capability to make some, but perhaps not all, decisions. For example, a patient may be able to identify a proxy decision maker and yet be unable to select specific treatment options. People with mild dementia may be competent to understand the nature and significance of different options for care.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1990, the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), a federal law, was enacted to require patient education about advance directives at the time of hospital admission, as well as documentation of this education. Nursing homes are also mandated to enhance residents&#x2019; autonomy by increasing their involvement in health care decision making. In both nursing homes and hospitals, the documentation and placement of advance directives in the medical record and the education of patients about advance directives vary considerably. Periodically, it is important to ensure that the directives reflect the current wishes of the patient and that all providers have a copy so that they are aware of the patient&#x2019;s wishes.</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> You notice an increase in the number of older patients who are confused on the medical-surgical unit where you work. What do you suspect may be the cause of this increase in patients who are confused? What screening tool(s) would you recommend for these patients? Would you recommend that these tools be used for every older patient? Why? What is the strength of the evidence base guiding your assessment, actions, and recommendations?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> A 90-year-old man has been admitted to your medical unit with urinary retention. What nursing and interprofessional assessments are indicated during your initial interactions with him? What other interprofessional services might you try to engage?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span><img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> During a home visit, an 81-year-old woman with diabetes and a lower limb amputation admits to you that she has fallen three times in the past 6 months.
