<h4 class="h4" id="s779">Cystic Fibrosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">CF is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians. It is less frequently found among Hispanic, Asian, and African Americans. A person must inherit a defective copy of the CF gene (one from each parent) to have CF. Each year, 1000 new cases of CF are diagnosed, and more than 75% of patients are diagnosed by 2 years of age (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [CFF], 2019a). In 2010, over 50% of people with CF in the United States were diagnosed with newborn screening (<a href="#bib1601">Heltshe, Cogen, Ramos, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States have CF and half are over the age of 18. CF was once a fatal childhood disease; however, the median expected survival age is now 37 (<a href="#bib1607">National Institutes of Health, 2018</a>). Furthermore, survival age is projected to rise to 57 years if the survival rate continues to improve 1.8% per year (<a href="#bib1601">Heltshe et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The improved survival rate is due to advances in medical management and procedures such as lung transplantation. Now that the median survival age has increased to 37 years for patients with CF, issues that were not present in past generations have arisen. These issues include antibiotic resistance and the desire for patients with CF to have their own biologic children.</p>
<p class="indent">Although most patients are diagnosed by 2 years of age, this disease may not be diagnosed until later in life (CFF, 2019b). Respiratory symptoms are frequently the major manifestation of CF when it is diagnosed later in life. These patients will not demonstrate the classic symptoms of CF, which may potentially cause a diagnostic dilemma.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s780">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CF is caused by mutations or dysfunction in the protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which normally transports chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes. Gene mutations affect transport of these ions, leading to CF, which is characterized by thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive tract as well as increased salt content in sweat gland secretions. The most common mutation is &#x0394;F508; however, researchers have identified more than 1700 mutations of the disease (CFF, 2019a). The numerous mutations of the CFTR gene create multiple variations in the presentation and progression of the disease.</p>
<p class="indent">The ability to detect the common mutations of this gene allows for routine screening for CF and the detection of carriers of the disease. Genetic counseling is an important part of health care for couples at risk (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>). People who are heterozygous for CF (i.e., have one defective gene and one normal gene) do not have the disease but can be carriers and pass the defective gene on to their children. If both parents are carriers, their risk of having a child with CF is one in four (25%) with each pregnancy. Any biologic offspring of a patient with CF will have CF. Genetic testing should be offered to adults with a positive family history of CF and to partners of people with CF who are planning a pregnancy or seeking prenatal counseling. The hallmark pathology of CF is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page644" title="644"></span>bronchial mucus plugging, inflammation, and eventual bronchiectasis. Commonly, the bronchiectasis begins in the upper lobes and progresses to involve all lobes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s781">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pulmonary manifestations of CF include a productive cough, wheezing, hyperinflation of the lung fields on chest x-ray, and pulmonary function test results consistent with obstructive disease of the airways. Chronic respiratory inflammation and infection are caused by impaired mucus clearance. Colonization of the airways with pathogenic bacteria usually occurs early in life. <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>H. influenzae</em> are common organisms during early childhood. As the disease progresses, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is ultimately isolated from the sputum of most patients (Simon, Mallory, &#x0026; Hoppin, 2019b). Upper respiratory manifestations of the disease include sinusitis and nasal polyps. Pulmonary complications of CF are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (Simon, Mallory, &#x0026; Hoppin, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Nonpulmonary manifestations include gastrointestinal problems (e.g., pancreatic insufficiency, recurrent abdominal pain, biliary cirrhosis, vitamin deficiencies, recurrent pancreatitis, weight loss), CF-related diabetes, and genitourinary problems (male and female infertility). (See <a href="c44.xhtml">Chapter 44</a> for a discussion of pancreatitis.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s782">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of CF requires a clinical picture consistent with the CF phenotype and laboratory evidence of CFTR dysfunction. Key assessment findings in adults include (<a href="#bib1635">Katkin, Mallory, &#x0026; Hoppin, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Chronic sinopulmonary disease as manifested by chronic cough and sputum production, persistent infection consistent with typical CF pathogens, and x-ray evidence of bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis, often with nasal polyps</span></li>
<li><span>Gastrointestinal tract and nutritional abnormalities (pancreatic insufficiency, recurrent pancreatitis, biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension, CF-related diabetes)</span></li>
<li><span>Male urogenital problems as manifested by congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens; reduced female fertility</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s783">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CF requires both acute and chronic therapy. Cornerstones of treatment include multimodal antibiotic regimens, airway clearance measures, bronchodilators, CFTR modulators, nutritional support, and exercise (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019a). Multimodal antibiotic regimens use different types of antibiotics and routes (oral, inhaled, and IV) to help control, suppress, and treat exacerbation of bacterial infections. Airway clearance measures entail the use of the mucolytics (e.g., dornase alfa; see later discussion), inhaled hypertonic saline, and various pulmonary techniques that promote mucus expectoration.</p>
<p class="indent">Because chronic infection (viral and bacterial) of the airways occurs in CF, control of infections is essential to treatment. It is best to prevent viral infections. Administering viral influenza vaccinations is essential for CF patients. Due to the increased risk of viral influenza, some CF patients may benefit from prophylactic treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor (e.g., zanamivir, oseltamivir) (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Bacterial infection requires aggressive therapy to improve airway clearance and the use of antibiotics based on results of sputum cultures. The majority of patients are colonized with <em>P. aeruginosa;</em> however, <em>S. aureus,</em> methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus,</em> and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> complex are examples of other commonly found pathogens (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic infection with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is an independent risk factor for accelerated loss of lung function and decreased survival (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b). <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is also common in CF exacerbations and new strains may develop with recurring infections leading to different antibiotic-resistance profiles (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b). As CF patients are living longer and experiencing more exacerbations, antibiotic resistance is becoming a serious concern and can affect life expectancy.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>B. cepacia</em> complex consists of different species of bacteria. Infection with <em>B. cepacia</em> complex, in general, is associated with poor outcomes in CF patients as a result of the bacteria&#x2019;s inherent antibiotic resistance. Infection with this complex may prevent a CF patient from becoming a lung transplant candidate (<a href="#bib1635">Hachem, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Routine cultures of respiratory secretions are used to identify organisms and guide antibiotic selection. Two IV antibiotics have been typically prescribed to treat a severe exacerbation of <em>P. aeruginosa.</em> Tobramycin, along with piperacillin-tazobactam, a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftizoxime, ceftazidime), a carbapenem (e.g., meropenem, aztreonam) may be prescribed (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b). Three newer combination medications, ceftazidime and avibactam, meropenem and vaborbactam, and ceftolozane and tazobactam, unite commonly known antibiotics with a beta-lactamase inhibitor to counteract bacterial resistance. Dosing of antibiotics is determined on a case-by-case basis; some patients may require higher doses or an extended IV infusion. When methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> accompanies <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, vancomycin is administered in addition to dual IV antibiotic therapy (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b). Careful monitoring is always required to minimize any side effects of the antibiotics.</p>
<p class="indent">Maintenance oral antibiotic therapies are sometimes employed to help suppress infections caused by other common bacteria such as methicillin-sensitive <em>S. aureus</em>. These infections vary across patients and require individualized patient care. The antibiotic regimens used vary depending on the specific organism grown and severity of infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Inhaled antibiotics are mainly used to treat <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. Tobramycin is the first-line inhaled antibiotic choice but aztreonam can be used as an alternative treatment. Typically, these antibiotics are used on a 28-day on and 28-day off regimen. Patients with deteriorating lung function or recurrent exacerbations may use these antibiotics by rotating courses of inhaled tobramycin and aztreonam without implementing a 28-day off period (Simon, Mallory, &#x0026; Hoppin, 2019c). Although there is no general consensus on the use of inhaled colistimethate sodium, this drug can be used with patients who do not respond well with the other inhaled antibiotics (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Various pulmonary techniques are used to promote airway clearance through the expectoration of secretions. Examples include CPT with manual postural drainage; HFCWO; autogenic drainage (a combination of breathing techniques at different lung volume levels to move the secretions to where they can be huff-coughed out); and other devices that assist in airway clearance, such as masks that generate positive expiratory pressure (PEP masks) and flutter valves (devices that provide an oscillatory expiratory pressure pattern with PEP and assist with expectoration of secretions). It is important to assure that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page645" title="645"></span>patient is properly positioned when using the flutter valve and that the patient uses proper technique with this treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Dornase alfa is a nebulized medication given to degrade the large amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that accumulates within CF mucus. This agent helps decrease the viscosity of the sputum and promotes expectoration of secretions. It is recommended for patients with moderate to severe disease (severity of lung disease classification is based on predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> percentage). In addition, inhaled hypertonic saline may be used in the chronic treatment of CF. Inhalations increase hydration of the airway surface liquid in patients with CF and improve airway clearance.</p>
<p class="indent">Nebulized and IV antibiotics or a combination may be used to treat chronic colonization of the lung. Nebulization provides high intrapulmonary drug concentrations and minimal systemic absorption. Inhaled tobramycin or aztreonam have been shown to decrease the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. Acute infections are treated with a variety of IV antibiotics. Such infections remain a major cause of mortality related to pulmonary exacerbations in adults with CF.</p>
<p class="indent">Other therapeutic measures may be necessary as well. Anti-inflammatory agents may be used to treat inflammatory response in the airways. There is insufficient evidence for the use of routine inhaled or oral corticosteroids (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b). IV corticosteroids are used during acute exacerbations and only for those patients with asthmalike symptoms (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019b). Inhaled bronchodilators (e.g., salmeterol, tiotropium bromide) may be used in patients who have a significant bronchoconstrictive component; this is confirmed by spirometry before and after therapy is instituted (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency occurs frequently in people with CF and requires oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation with meals (<a href="#bib1635">Katkin, Baker, &#x0026; Baker, 2019</a>). Given the fat malabsorption in CF and increased caloric needs due to the work of breathing, nutritional counseling and weight monitoring are extremely important. Supplements of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are also used.</p>
<p class="indent">CFTR modulators are a class of drugs that help prevent the progression of CF (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c). These agents are novel in that they aim to address the cause of CF as opposed to treating symptoms. There are two classes of modulators used in treating CF: potentiators (help salt and water flow through the CFTR protein channel at the cell surface) and correctors (help the CFTR protein to form the right 3D shape so that it is able to move to the cell surface). The selection of the CFTR modulator depends on the patient&#x2019;s specific CFTR mutation and the patient&#x2019;s age (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Ivacaftor, a potentiator, improves salt and water movement across the membrane (thus improving hydration and clearing of mucus from the airways). The drug does not correct the gene mutation; it only helps in the movement of salt and water across the membrane. Monotherapy of ivacaftor is approved for patients with CF who are 6 months of age and older (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Although corrector drugs (e.g., lumacaftor, tezacaftor) help the CFTR protein reach the cell surface, they do not diminish CF symptoms because the proteins that do reach the cell surface are unable to improve the flow of salt and water across the cell membrane. This is why lumacaftor and tezacaftor are used in combination with ivacaftor. Combined, these drugs can modestly improve lung function and reduce CF exacerbations (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c). Lumacaftor-ivacaftor is approved for patients 2 years of age and older, but is only recommended for treating patients age 2 to 5. Tezacaftor-ivacaftor is the preferred treatment for patients 6 years of age and older because it produces fewer side effects and drug&#x2013;drug interactions than lumacaftor-ivacaftor (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c).</p>
<p class="indent">Currently, a triple combination of tezacaftor-ivacaftor with an additional CFTR corrector is being investigated for treating various CFTR mutations. One such medication, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, completed phase 3 clinical trials and is being reviewed by the FDA to treat patients with CF age 12 years and older. This drug improves &#x0394;F508 CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and function (Simon et&#x00A0;al., 2019c). The goal of these new modulators is to improve the functionality of the CFTR and restore chloride transport at the cellular level, thus decreasing symptoms and complications related to the disease. These positive effects include less viscous mucus production, decreased exacerbation frequency, and improved nutrient absorption.</p>
<p class="indent">As the pulmonary deterioration advances, supplemental oxygen is used to treat the progressive hypoxemia that occurs with CF. It helps correct the hypoxemia and may minimize the complications seen with chronic hypoxemia (pulmonary hypertension). Lung transplantation is an option for a small, select population of patients with CF. A double-lung transplantation technique is used because of chronic infection of both lungs in end-stage CF. Because there is a long waiting list for lung transplants, many patients die while waiting for suitable lungs for transplantation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s784">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management is crucial to the interdisciplinary approach required for care of adults with CF. Nursing care includes helping patients manage pulmonary symptoms and prevent complications. Specific measures include strategies that promote removal of pulmonary secretions, CPT (including postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration), and breathing exercises (which are implemented and taught to the patient and family when the patient is very young). The patient is reminded of the need to reduce risk factors associated with respiratory infections (e.g., exposure to crowds or to people with known infections). In addition, the patient is taught the early signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and disease progression that indicate the need to notify a primary provider.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse emphasizes the importance of an adequate fluid and dietary intake to promote removal of secretions and to ensure an adequate nutritional status. Because CF is a lifelong disorder, patients often have learned to modify their daily activities to accommodate their symptoms and treatment modalities. As the disease progresses, periodic reassessment of the home environment may be warranted to identify modifications required to address changes in the patient&#x2019;s needs, increasing dyspnea and fatigue, and nonpulmonary symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">As with any chronic disease, palliative care and end-of-life issues and concerns need to be addressed with the patient when warranted. For the patient whose disease is progressing and who is developing increasing hypoxemia, preferences for end-of-life care should be discussed, documented, and honored (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>). Patients and family members require support as they face a shortened lifespan and an uncertain future (<a href="#bib1617">Tomaszek, Debska, Cepuch, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> A 55-year-old man presented to the ED with complaints of acute shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. SpO<sub>2</sub> on admission to the ED was 85% on room air. His admitting diagnosis was acute exacerbation of COPD. He was admitted to a general medicine unit, and arrived to his room on 4 L of O<sub>2</sub> via nasal cannula. During his admission assessment, the patient tells you that he works in the coal mines and his shift supervisor had to bring him to the hospital. He also states that he has a long history of smoking 1 to 2 packs of cigarettes per day and his attempts to quit have been unsuccessful. While conducting the assessment, you note that the patient has a productive cough and is becoming confused to time. What is your priority as you admit this patient? What information would you provide the primary provider? What tests might be ordered to help further evaluate the patient&#x2019;s condition? What information would you need to ask the patient to plan for a home discharge? What health care team members would you consult to plan for a home discharge?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> A 20-year-old male with a history of asthma presents to the ED with severe shortness of breath and dyspnea at rest. He said he had a cold last week and was coughing up clear sputum. This morning he began expectorating yellow sputum and became increasingly short of breath. He used his rescue inhaler with little relief. Before he came to the ED, he used his rescue inhaler every half hour. Upon presentation to ED triage, his SpO<sub>2</sub> was 90% on room air, but is now 84% on room air. Physical examination reveals tachycardia at 136 bpm, cyanotic lips, and tachypnea at 30 breaths/min with signs of accessory muscle use. When asked about his asthma medications, he admits he only uses his prescribed daily inhaler once a day because it is too expensive. He also stated his primary provider gave him a breathing machine for medicine but he did not know how to use it. What is your priority of care? What evidence-based medical and nursing interventions would improve the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status? What educational needs does this patient have?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> A 25-year-old woman is hospitalized for CF. She was admitted for elevated temperature and weight loss. At the time of admission, she was not using oxygen therapy at home. She was working full-time in a department store prior to this exacerbation. She told the social worker yesterday that she is afraid she will have to quit her job and will lose her health insurance. Her husband, who is unemployed, is also dependent on her for health insurance. Today, she is unable to eat due to the severe dyspnea. Physical assessment reveals SpO<sub>2</sub> of 87% on 2 L of O<sub>2</sub> via nasal cannula, bilateral crackles with severely diminished breath sounds on the right, and expectoration of thick yellow sputum. What evidence-based interventions might be used to alleviate her CF symptoms? Identify the criteria used to evaluate the strength of the evidence for these practices.</p>
