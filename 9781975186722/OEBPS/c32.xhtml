<p class="nonindent">The human immune system is complex and multidimensional. It works to protect against invasion by foreign substances, protect against the proliferation of neoplastic cells, and plays a key role in inflammation and healing. Patients with primary or secondary immune system disorders (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Norris, 2019</a>) require care from nurses who are knowledgeable about the pathophysiology, diagnostic procedures, and interventions that are used in the management of these disorders.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec1">PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCIES DISEASES</p>
<p class="nonindent">The majority of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDDs):&lt;/b&gt; rare, genetic disorders that impair the immune system">primary immune deficiency diseases</button></strong> (<strong>PIDDs</strong>), rare inherited disorders that impair the immune system, are commonly diagnosed in infancy, with a male-to-female ratio of 5 to 1. However, some PIDDs are not diagnosed until adolescence or early adulthood, when the gender distribution equalizes. Diagnosis at this stage frequently is confounded by frequent use of antibiotics that mask symptoms. Adults may present with clinical episodes of infectious diseases beyond the scope of normal immunocompetence, such as infections that are unusually persistent, recurrent, or resistant to treatment and that involve unexpected dissemination of disease or atypical pathogens. These rare inherited disorders not only lead to frequent infections, but also to increased risk of autoimmune disorders and malignancy (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2339">Hajjar, Guffey, Minard, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1271">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are more than 200 forms of PIDDs affecting about 500,000 people in the United States, and more than 270 different genes are associated with PIDDs. These rare genetic diseases prevent the body from developing normal immune responses resulting in a complex group of disorders with a wide array of clinical presentations. Many present during the first year of life and may be chronic, debilitating, and costly (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1272">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Major signs and symptoms include multiple infections despite aggressive treatment, infections with unusual or opportunistic organisms, failure to thrive or poor growth, and a significant family history. Fatigue was reported in 18% of patients with PIDDs (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2339">Hajjar et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). See <a href="#tt32-1">Table 32-1</a> for select PIDDs along with some of their clinical manifestations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1273">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is often a considerable delay between the onset of symptoms and time of diagnosis of PIDDs. Because of the genetic origins of PIDDs, family history should be carefully assessed but epidemiologic data about specific infectious agents should be considered as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory tests are used to identify antibody deficiencies, cellular (T-cell) defects, neutrophil disorders, and complement deficiencies. A complete blood cell count with manual differential should always be analyzed first. Lymphopenia may indicate an immunologic abnormality; serum Ig levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA) and antibody responses to vaccines should be assessed to detect a humoral immune defect. Age-matched normal ranges need to be used since antibody levels change as the person ages (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1274">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Live vaccines are contraindicated in patients with antibody deficiency disorders. The patient is incapable of generating antibodies and the live substance in the vaccine can cause disease. Family planning should be addressed in terms of future pregnancies; in some situations, prenatal in utero testing of a fetus can determine whether the infant will be affected.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1275">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A pattern of unusually frequent, opportunistic, or severe infections generates the possibility of a PIDD and initial testing or referral to an immunologist. Patients with neutropenia are at increased risk for developing severe infections despite substantial advances in supportive care. Epidemiologic shifts occur periodically and must be detected early because they influence prophylactic, empiric, and specific strategies for medical management. Attention to infection control practices is important, especially with the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms.</p>
<p class="indent">Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative modality. The stem cells may be from embryos or adults. Toxicity and reduced efficacy are frequent limitations of HSCT. See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of HSCT.</p>
<p class="indent">Another therapy involves the use of cells as vehicles for the delivery of genes or gene products. Gene therapy has had many adverse effects; the first studies in human participants revealed numerous toxicities with this therapy. Rapidly emerging new technologies allowing precise DNA targeting may prove to be a useful approach (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">McDermott &#x0026; Murphy, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic treatment depends upon the type and severity of presenting infection and the particular PIDD diagnosis. Prophylactic drug treatment prevents some bacterial and fungal infections but it must be used with caution because it has been implicated in the emergence of resistant organisms. The choices for empiric therapy include combination regimens and monotherapy. Specific choices depend on local factors (epidemiology, susceptibility/resistance patterns, availability, cost). Patients with antibody deficiencies receive regular Ig replacement therapy including both IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) to provide functional antibodies (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Stonebraker, Hajjar, &#x0026; Orange, 2018</a>; <a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2354">Vitiello, Emmi, Silvestri, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1276">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients with PIDDs have comorbid autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cytopenias, and inflammatory bowel disease. Many patients require immunosuppression to ensure engraftment of depleted bone marrow during transplantation procedures. For this reason, nursing care must be meticulous. Appropriate hand hygiene and infection prevention precautions are essential. See <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>, <a href="c66-sec02.xhtml#ct66-1">Chart 66-1</a> for hand hygiene methods and <a href="c66-sec02.xhtml#ct66-2">Chart 66-2</a> for a summary of infection prevention precautions. Institutional policies and procedures related to infection prevention care must be followed scrupulously until definitive evidence demonstrates that precautions are unnecessary. Continual monitoring of the patient&#x2019;s condition is critical, so early signs of impending infection may be detected and treated before they seriously compromise the patient&#x2019;s status.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients and caregivers in the home are taught how to administer medications, including regular Ig replacement therapy, if prescribed. Instruction is provided to the patient and family about how to administer the therapy at home (see <a href="c32-sec01.xhtml#ct32-1">Chart 32-1</a>). Nurses provide ongoing education and support for the patient and family.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec2">ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY</p>
<p class="nonindent">Immune deficiency can be acquired due to medical treatment such as chemotherapy (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) or infection from pathogens such as human immune deficiency virus (HIV). Advances have been made in treating HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); however, AIDS remains a critical public health issue in communities across the United States and around the world. Prevention, early detection, and ongoing treatment remain important aspects of care for people living with HIV infection or AIDS, who are sometimes referred to as persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The American Nurses Association (ANA) has issued a position statement in support of efforts to end HIV (ANA, 2019).</p>
