<h4 class="h4" id="s2717">Outpatient Burn Care</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The increased availability of outpatient surgery and access to expert burn care in outpatient settings make this option possible for the treatment of minor burns as well as follow-up for the patient with more severe burns once discharged. The goals for treatment in an outpatient setting may include burn wound management, pain management, scar and reconstructive care, psychosocial care, and rehabilitation. However, a number of factors must be considered when determining if outpatient care is appropriate for the patient: age, past medical history, extent and depth of the burn, location of the burn wounds, availability of family support systems and community resources, the patient&#x2019;s ability and willingness to adhere to a therapeutic regimen, distance from home to the outpatient setting, and availability of transportation to and from home and the outpatient setting.</p>

<div class="box13"><p class="Box13pTitle"><strong>The Patient with a Burn Injury</strong></p>
<p class="BOX13MSP1"><strong>At the completion of education, the patient and/or caregiver will be able to:</strong></p>
<p class="Box13BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State the impact of the burn injury and treatment on physiologic functioning, performance of ADLs and IADLs, roles, relationships, and spirituality.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State how to contact all members of the treatment team (e.g., interdisciplinary burn team, healthcare providers, home care professionals, and durable medical equipment and supply vendors).</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State the name, dose, side effects, frequency, and schedule for all medications.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Demonstrate psychosocial adaptation and social integration through verbalizing understanding of the following:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Changes in lifestyle and emotional adjustment to injury take time. It is not uncommon for patients to report nightmares or &#x201C;flashbacks&#x201D; of the injury. If this becomes disruptive, it should be discussed with the treatment team.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Resume previous interests and activities gradually.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Consider community and other resources such as burn support groups. Many books, videos, and Web sites are also available and may be invaluable in assisting with burn recovery.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Programs are available to assist with school reintegration and return to work. The treatment team should be consulted as needed.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Burn care (dressings, medications, therapy) can be very expensive. A social worker or care manager may find funding assistance programs if needed.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Demonstrate adaptation of the home environment, assisted as needed by team members (e.g., social worker, care manager).</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State burn skin precautions:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Apply sunblock with the highest sun protection factor (SPF) possible to protect exposed burned skin from the sun. Light-colored clothing, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts may also be necessary to protect from the sun.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use wide-brimmed hats if face or ears have been burned to protect the area from the sun.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid further trauma to burned skin; leave blisters that may form intact.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lubricate healed burned skin with lotion (as prescribed); avoid scratching.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use only mild soaps and lotions (i.e., products without perfume or deodorants) on burned areas. Keeping skin clean overall is important to support good hygiene and prevent infection.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid tight clothing over burned areas so as not to restrict movement or irritate newly healed areas.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Select white cotton, loose-fitting clothing so that dyes in colored clothes do not irritate healing skin.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wear clothing and gloves to protect healing skin from unnecessary bruises, bumps, and scratches.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that tolerance to extremes in temperatures may be affected.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Itching is a normal, uncomfortable part of healing and burn recovery; do not scratch, pat areas; apply mild moisturizers to decrease itching from dryness. Medications for itching can be discussed with the treatment team.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Demonstrate wound care technique:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take prescribed pain medications if needed 30 minutes prior to wound care to achieve maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use mild soap, water, and a clean washcloth to clean wounds.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Apply prescribed topical medications and dressings as instructed.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inspect wounds carefully with each dressing change for signs of infection, including increased redness, swelling, drainage, or foul odor.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State aspects of ADLs and exercise:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perform as much of own care as possible.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Adhere to the exercise regimen given by the therapists. Although physical rehabilitation is tiring, daily participation is essential.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Plan for adequate rest and sleep.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When at rest, swollen limbs should be elevated.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe approaches to controlling pain (e.g., take antispasmodic agents as prescribed; use nonpharmacologic interventions).</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State changes in diet necessary to promote health (e.g., nutrient-rich foods, rather than empty calories).</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State changes in fluid intake needed to prevent constipation associated with the use of analgesic medications.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Discuss management of burn scar:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Massage with mild lotion or cream to stretch skin to maintain/increase its elasticity.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wear compression garments 23 hours a day if instructed.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Discoloration of the skin for many months is an expected normal part of healing.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Discuss resumption of intimacy:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Resumption of sexual relationships is the rule rather than the exception and should occur when comfortable for all.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Expect sensitivity of and around the genital area for several months if these areas were burned.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State correct use of medical devices:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Follow occupational therapist&#x2019;s instructions for splint use and cleaning.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use crutches, walkers, or other assistive devices as instructed.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If devices such as shower chairs or grab bars are needed in the home, this should be arranged prior to discharge.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>State time and date of follow-up appointments, therapy, and testing:</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep a list of questions to ask team members.</p>
<p class="Box13BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Bring medications, or a list of current medications, to each visit for the team to review.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the need for health promotion, disease prevention, and screening activities.</p>
<p class="Box13BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the contact details for support services for patients and their caregivers/families.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">ADLs, activities of daily living; IADLs, instrumental activities of daily living.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The frequency of follow-up visits is individualized. The initial outpatient visit for a discharged patient with burn injuries is usually scheduled within 3 to 5 days after hospital discharge. A survivor&#x2019;s follow-up appointment schedule <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1892" title="1892"></span>will vary and decrease in frequency over time, based on patient&#x2019;s needs. Patient and family education is paramount and should include verbal and written instructions as well as return demonstration of the wound or scar care required. The importance of notifying the outpatient setting about changes in symptoms and of keeping follow-up appointments is emphasized to the patient and family. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are often provided in the outpatient burn setting. The rehabilitation goals are to increase range of motion, strengthen muscles, and build the patient&#x2019;s activity tolerance through a specific, individualized plan of care that includes routine visits for up to 2 years or more following the injury.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s adaptation to lifestyle changes and emotional status should be assessed during the outpatient visits and proper referrals made for counseling services. These assessments may be difficult to recognize due to the infrequent nature of the visits; therefore, it is helpful to incorporate family response and interactions into the assessment. The healthcare team must also be alert to issues of substance abuse, safety concerns, suicidal thoughts, depression, and PTSD.</p>
<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon18ebp.png" alt=""/> A 55-year-old man is hospitalized for a smoke inhalation injury with a 15% TBSA burn to his upper torso and extremities. He has been placed on 100% oxygen per non-rebreather mask and started on a morphine drip for pain control. He awakens when verbally stimulated, but he does not consistently follow directions. Which evidence-based tools should you use to assess the patient&#x2019;s neurologic and pulmonary status, and his response to pain management? What evidence-based nursing interventions should be integrated into the plan of care to support his pulmonary status and to manage the distress associated with his burn and high oxygen requirement?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon09cte.png" alt=""/> A 65-year-old man was admitted overnight to the burn unit with an 18% partial-thickness scald burn. The day after admission, in the early afternoon, you note that the patient&#x2019;s heart rate has increased to 160 bpm, temperature is 38.7&#x00B0;C (101.7&#x00B0;F), and his capillary refill time has increased to greater than 2 seconds. After alerting the charge nurse, what interventions do you anticipate? What are your priority interventions?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon09aipc.png" alt=""/> An 85-year-old woman is admitted to the burn center with a 65% TBSA full-thickness burn. She is a widow, with no living children, but has a neighbor who is her identified surrogate decision maker. Her body mass index (BMI) on admission is 16.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and she reports weight loss over the last year and a poor appetite. She takes no medications and has not seen a medical provider for many years. She reports a strong religious background and states that she believes that God has always watched over her and is doing so now. She consents to a workup for a mass that was observed in a routine chest x-ray. A biopsy of the lesion obtained after consent shows a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. She continues to agree to daily wound care but refuses surgery. The oncology consulting service states that she may benefit from chemotherapy. The surgery team believes that she would benefit from supplemental feeding via a feeding tube. Her pain is well controlled. What interprofessional consultation service could help to best facilitate patient-centered outcomes for this patient? Describe how the various members of this team could support this patient.</p>
