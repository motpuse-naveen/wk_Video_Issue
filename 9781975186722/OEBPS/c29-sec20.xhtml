<h4 class="h4" id="s1189">Protein C Deficiency</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Protein C is a vitamin K&#x2013;dependent enzyme synthesized in the liver that, when activated, inhibits coagulation. When protein C levels are low, the risk for thrombosis increases and thrombosis may occur spontaneously. People with protein C deficiency are often asymptomatic until they reach adulthood; the risk for thrombosis then increases with age. A rare but important complication for patients with protein C deficiency receiving warfarin for anticoagulation is warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This condition is believed to be a result of progressive thrombosis of capillaries in the skin. The degree of necrosis can be quite extensive (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Bunn &#x0026; Bauer, 2017</a>). Prompt recognition of the problem with immediate cessation of the warfarin, along with treatment with vitamin K, heparin, and fresh-frozen plasma infusions are needed to arrest the pathophysiologic process and reverse the effects of warfarin. Treatment with purified protein C concentrate may be necessary.</p>
