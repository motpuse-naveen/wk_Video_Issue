<h4 class="h4a" id="s2254"><strong>URINARY DIVERSIONS</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Urinary diversion procedures are performed to divert urine from the bladder to a new exit site, usually through a surgically <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1628" title="1628"></span>created opening (stoma) in the skin. These procedures are primarily performed when a bladder tumor necessitates cystectomy (NCI, 2020) and are most commonly associated with a high-grade or muscle-invasive bladder cancer (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Caruso et al., 2017</a>). Urinary diversion has also been used in managing pelvic malignancy, birth defects, strictures, trauma to the ureters and urethra, neurogenic bladder, chronic infection causing severe ureteral and kidney damage, and intractable interstitial cystitis. It may also be used as a last resort in managing incontinence.</p>
<p class="indent">Controversy exists about the best method of establishing permanent diversion of the urinary tract. New techniques are frequently introduced in an effort to improve patient outcomes and quality of life (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3602">Shi, Yu, Bellmont, et al., 2018</a>). The age of the patient, condition of the bladder, body build, presence of obesity, degree of ureteral dilation, status of kidney function, and the patient&#x2019;s learning ability, and willingness to participate in postoperative care are all taken into consideration when determining the appropriate surgical procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">The types of urinary diversions are an ileal conduit, an orthotopic neobladder reconstruction, or various other continent urinary diversions (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3607">Yang, Bai, Wang, et al., 2019</a>). The choice of a urinary diversion surgical procedure depends on the patient&#x2019;s and surgeon&#x2019;s preferences, the extent of comorbidity, and the quality of life goal in the postoperative period (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>). Variations in urinary diversion surgical procedures are devised frequently in an effort to identify and perfect procedures that will improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of postoperative problems (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Yang et al., 2019</a>).</p>
