<h4 class="h4" id="s443">Special Issues for the Nurse in End-of-Life Care</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care often intersects with moral and ethical dilemmas (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> for further discussion of ethics). Nurses are encouraged to personally examine their respective moral compasses in order to provide the best, unbiased care for patients and families. In caring for patients at the end-of-life, questions of <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> may arise in relation to treatment options. The ANA&#x2019;s <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses</em> provides a framework for the nurse to support patients, with guiding principles being the patient&#x2019;s right to self-determination and the nurse&#x2019;s adherence to professional nursing standards (ANA, 2015). When approaching an ethical dilemma, the nurse should take the following steps: define the problem, clarify facts and assumptions, compile a list of all options, evaluate options with interdisciplinary team input, and choose the most appropriate option and implement the plan (<a href="#bib1220">Prince-Paul &#x0026; Daly, 2019</a>). The most common ethical dilemmas a nurse will encounter are determining decisional capacity, withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging measures&#x2014;including, but not limited to, ventilator support, dialysis, artificial nutrition and hydration&#x2014;requests for hastening death, and concerns related to proxy decision making. Select ethical issues are discussed in greater detail in the following sections.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s444">Medically Administered Nutrition and Hydration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although nutritional supplementation may be an important part of the treatment plan in early or chronic illness, unintended weight loss and dehydration are expected characteristics of progressive illness. As illness progresses, patients, families, and clinicians may believe that without artificial nutrition and hydration, patients who are terminally ill will <em>starve,</em> causing profound suffering and hastened death. The use of artificial nutrition and hydration (tube and intravenous fluids and feeding) carries considerable risks and generally does not contribute to comfort at the end-of-life (<a href="#bib1111">Casarett, Kapo, &#x0026; Kaplan, 2005</a>; <a href="#bib1220">Marcolini, Putnam, &#x0026; Aydin, 2018</a>). Similarly, survival is not increased when patients who are terminally ill with advanced dementia receive enteral feeding, and no data support an association between tube feeding and improved quality of life in these patients (<a href="#bib1220">De &#x0026; Thomas, 2019</a>). Furthermore, in patients who are close to death, symptoms associated with dehydration such as dry mouth, confusion, and diminished alertness are common and typically do not respond to artificial nutrition and hydration (<a href="#bib1220">Danis, Arnold, &#x0026; Savarese, 2018</a>). Dry mouth can generally be managed through nursing measures such as mouth care, and environmental changes with medications can help to diminish confusion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s445">Palliative Sedation at the End-of-Life</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Effective control of symptoms can be achieved under most conditions; however, some patients may experience distressing, intractable symptoms. Although <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;palliative sedation:&lt;/b&gt; controlled and monitored use of certain sedatives and nonopioid medications with the intention of reducing the patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness for the relief of refractory pain and symptoms that have not responded to other management measures; the purpose is not to hasten the patient&#x2019;s death but to relieve intractable symptoms">palliative sedation</button></strong> remains controversial, it is offered in some settings to patients who are close to death or who have symptoms that do not respond to conventional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, resulting in unrelieved suffering. Palliative sedation is distinguished from euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in that the intent of palliative sedation is to relieve symptoms, not to hasten death (see <a href="#ct13-9">Chart&#x00A0;13-9</a>). Proportionate palliative sedation uses the minimum drug necessary to relieve the symptom while preserving consciousness, whereas palliative sedation induces unconsciousness, which is more controversial (<a href="#bib1165">Quill, Lo, Brock, et&#x00A0;al., 2009</a>). Palliative sedation is most commonly used when the patient exhibits intractable pain, dyspnea, seizures, or delirium, and it is generally considered appropriate in only the most difficult situations. Palliative sedation is accomplished through an infusion of one or more pharmacologic agents in doses adequate to eliminate signs of discomfort. Before implementing palliative sedation, the health care team should assess for the presence of underlying and treatable causes of suffering, such as depression or spiritual distress. Finally, the patient and the family should be fully informed about the use of this treatment and alternatives. A retrospective study of Italian hospice patients reported that palliative sedation was documented as discussed in only half of the cases where it was implemented (<a href="#bib1138">Ingravallo, de Nooijer, Pucci, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Published guidelines for pharmacologic management of palliative sedation vary widely internationally (<a href="#bib1095">Abarshi, Rietjens, Robijn, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) but most mention the use of midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine (<a href="#bib1145">Lux, Protus, Kimbrel, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Nurses act as collaborating members of the interdisciplinary health care team, providing emotional support to patients and families, facilitating clarification of values and preferences, and providing comfort-focused physical care. Once sedation has been induced, the nurse should continue to comfort the patient, monitor the physiologic effects of the sedation, support the family during the final hours or days of their loved one&#x2019;s life, and ensure communication within the health care team and between the team and the family.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Requests for Assistance in Dying</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A major debate in palliative and end-of-life care is the acceptability of a patient&#x2019;s requests to hasten death. Health care recognizes the right to choose for or against medical treatments when a patient is of sound mind and can relay a rationale for or against treatments. Further, patients may choose to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments and allow natural death if such therapies are not aligned with their wishes. When faced with a progressive life-limiting illness, some cannot fathom suffering at the end-of-life and explore options to hasten death. Language around assistance in dying has <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page387" title="387"></span>evolved over the years and it is important to recognize the following terms:</p>
<div class="box4a">
<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct13-9"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;13-9 <img class="m" src="images/icon55.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Does Intent Matter When Palliative Care Leads to Death?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You are a staff nurse working for an outpatient home hospice service. G.R. is a 68-year-old man admitted to home hospice service two months ago with advanced multiple myeloma. As a consequence of his disease he also has extensive destruction of bony matrix resulting in widespread pain, numerous vertebral fractures, and spinal cord compression. For the first six weeks that G.R. was managed in hospice, you and the hospice staff have successfully kept his pain and other symptoms under reasonable control. However, over the past two weeks his pain has been more difficult to control, despite escalating dosages of opioids. He has not been able to sleep, and is restless, dyspneic, and anxious. The hospice physician was consulted, and G.R. and his husband agreed to intravenous opioids, sedatives, and anxiolytics to relieve G.R.&#x2019;s suffering, knowing that he would also lose consciousness as a consequence of this treatment. However, they stated that though they were not pleased that G.R. would never regain consciousness, that result was offset by their hope was the G.R. might die peacefully. You administer the prescribed intravenous medications, and slowly administer the minimum dosages of these medications to relieve symptoms. G.R. loses consciousness and dies peacefully 48 hours later with his husband holding his hand at his bedside.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">There is a great deal of apprehension among both clinicians and laypersons around what constitutes comfort care (i.e., palliative care) at end-of-life and what may constitute either assisted suicide or euthanasia. The premise is that palliative care should ameliorate pain and suffering in the patient who is terminally ill, but it should not significantly shorten the patient&#x2019;s life.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The principle of double-effect highlights that some actions have two effects - one good, the other evil. The good and evil consequences are not considered in terms of proportions; if they were, and the evil outcome is death, then the good outcome could never be considered sufficient to justify the action. Rather, the intention behind the action is given paramount consideration. If the intention is to cause death, then the act is not morally justifiable. However, if the intention is to relieve suffering, then the act might be sanctioned.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe how the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence may intersect or be at odds with each other in this case. Discuss how palliative sedation meets the moral justification of the four criteria for the principle of double effect (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Would you describe your role in this case as complicit in assisted suicide, euthanasia, or providing palliation? What distinction, if any, might there be among these three acts?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Note that the ANA (2015) <em>Code of Ethics</em> clearly states that nurses should not <em>intentionally</em> cause a patient&#x2019;s death. What were your &#x201C;intentions&#x201D; in this case? How might intentionality be instrumental in making this act of titrating medications that provided palliation morally defensible? Are there resources you could identify that might be of assistance to you if you were to feel moral distress about your actions?</p>

<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Physician aid in dying (PAD), medical aid in dying (MAD), and physician-assisted dying:</em> A physician prescribes a lethal dose of oral medication that the patient self-administers, for the purpose of ending someone&#x2019;s life.</span></li>

<p class="indent">Although assisted suicide is expressly prohibited under statutory or common law in the majority of states, calls for legalized aid in dying have highlighted inadequacies in end-of-life care. In 1994, Oregon voters approved the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, the first and&#x2014;until 2009 only such legislative initiative to pass. This law provides for access to PAS by terminally ill patients under very controlled circumstances. After numerous challenges, the law was enacted in 1997. Of 2127 Oregonians who have received written prescriptions under the terms of the law since it was passed in 1997, 1459 have self-administered physician-prescribed lethal medication and have died (<a href="#bib1158">Oregon Public Health Division, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, additional states have adopted MAD laws, and Montana&#x2019;s Supreme Court has ruled that PAD is not a crime. International MAD is legal in Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Columbia, and Victoria in Australia. Proponents of PAS argue that people who are terminally ill should have a legally sanctioned right to make independent decisions about the value of their lives and the timing and circumstances of their deaths, and its opponents argue for greater access to symptom management and psychosocial support for people approaching the end-of-life.</p>
<p class="indent">In its 2013 position statement on <em>Euthanasia, Assisted Suicide, and Aid in Dying,</em> the ANA acknowledged the complexity of the assisted suicide debate but clearly stated that nursing participation in assisted suicide is a violation of the Code for Nurses. The ANA position statement further stressed the important role of the nurse in supporting effective symptom management, contributing to the creation of environments for care that honor the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s wishes, as well as identifying their concerns and fears (ANA, 2013). Per the ANA, &#x201C;Nurses have an obligation to provide humane, comprehensive, and compassionate care that respects the rights of patients but upholds the standards of the profession in the presence of chronic, debilitating illness and at end-of-life&#x201D; (ANA, 2013, p. 1).</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly, the HPNA favors the value of comprehensive end-of-life care, as opposed to physician-assisted death (HPNA, 2017). The HPNA acknowledges that nurses may care for patients exploring or choosing physician-assisted death and thus concludes that nurses must be able to provide unbiased education yet not take an active role in this end-of-life option. American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM, 2016) has taken a position of &#x201C;studied neutrality&#x201D; on assisted death, recommending that clinicians carefully assess the fear and suffering that have led patients to request assisted suicide and to address these without hastening death.</p>
<p class="indent">The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) released a position statement on euthanasia and PAS, in which they recommend access to palliative care and medication, such as opioids, prior to the legalization of both euthanasia and/or PAS. Further, they recommend that these acts should not be carried out on palliative care units (<a href="#bib1121">De Lima, Woodruff, Pettus, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Another potential, however quite controversial, option of last resort is voluntary stopping of eating and drinking (VSED) when a person cannot imagine prolonged dying and suffering for a life-limiting illness. Patient inquiry about VSED should be met with thorough assessment of both decisional capacity and presence of mental illness (<a href="#bib1164">Quill, Ganzini, Troug, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1183">Wax, An, Koiser, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Aggressive palliative treatments for all types of suffering&#x2014;physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and existential&#x2014;should be explored and offered before pursing VSED. Typically, a person will die 10 to 14 days after starting VSED during which the most distressing symptoms include thirst and delirium (<a href="#bib1164">Quill et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1183">Wax et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Given this expected prognosis, patients may have the opportunity to complete legacy work prior to initiating VSED.</p>
<p class="indent">The ANA included VSED in a 2017 position statement on <em>Nutrition and Hydration at the End of Life</em> in which the organization upholds respect for autonomy, relief of suffering, and expert care at the end of life. Nurses involved in the care of a patient who self-initiates VSED should support the family while providing expert symptom assessment and management. One example of a patient who may choose to pursue VSED is a patient who has been diagnosed with a progressive disease, such as ALS, and who finds a slow decline intolerable.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has altered the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care. Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia are managed with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and have a high case fatality rate (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>) (<a href="#bib1105">Bajwah, Wilcock, Towers, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib1166">Richardson, Hirsch, Narasimhan, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Common end-of-life symptoms for those with severe COVID-19 include dyspnea, cough, anxiety, and delirium (<a href="#bib1105">Bajwah et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). During the pandemic, symptom management at the end-of-life has required revisions due to logistical challenges such as medication shortages and preservation of personal protective equipment (<a href="#bib1115">Chidiac, Feuer, Naismith, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Due to high risk of infectious transmission, family members may not be permitted to see loved ones at the end-of-life (<a href="#bib1166">Richardson et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib1180">Wakam, Montgomery, Biesterveld, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Furthermore, family meetings are primarily virtual, where proxies must make difficult decisions such as resuscitation and intubation, and even removal of life support (<a href="#bib1166">Richardson et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Communication guides for proactive goals of care discussions related to possible COVID-19 infection (<a href="#bib1220">Back, Tulsky, &#x0026; Arnold, 2020</a>), recommendations for &#x201C;webside&#x201D; manner (<a href="#bib1220">Chua, Jackson, &#x0026; Kamdar, 2020</a>), innovative use of virtual reality to stimulate previously unachieved dreams or allow families to virtually share one last moment together (<a href="#bib1182">Wang, Teo, Teo, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Meanwhile, health care providers are struggling from high physical workload demands while simultaneously experiencing moral and psychological distress (<a href="#bib1220">Adams &#x0026; Walls, 2020</a>). Clinicians working with patients with COVID-19 voice concerns about the risk of infecting self and family and stress due to constant change as health care systems evolve to meet patient needs during a pandemic situation (<a href="#bib1220">Foxwell, 2020</a>). Health systems have developed innovative processes to support staff at the front lines of working with patients with COVID-19 and at end-of-life, such as a 24-hour hotlines and pet therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s446">Clinicians&#x2019; Attitudes toward Death</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinicians&#x2019; attitudes toward the terminally ill and dying remain the greatest barrier to improving care at the end-of-life. K&#x00FC;bler-Ross illuminated the concerns of the seriously ill and dying in her seminal work, <em>On Death and Dying,</em> first published in 1969. At that time, it was common for patients to be kept uninformed about life-threatening diagnoses, particularly cancer, and for primary providers and nurses to avoid open discussion of death and dying with their patients. K&#x00FC;bler-Ross&#x2019;s work revealed that, given open discussion, adequate time, and some help in working through the process, patients could reach a stage of acceptance in which they were neither angry nor depressed about their fate.</p>
<p class="indent">The growth of palliative and hospice care programs has led to greater numbers of health care providers becoming comfortable with and skilled in assessing patients&#x2019; and families&#x2019; information needs and disclosing honest information about the seriousness of illness (<a href="#bib1220">Brighton &#x0026; Bristowe, 2016</a>). However, in many settings, clinicians still avoid the topic of death in the hope that patients will ask or find out on their own. Despite progress on many health care fronts, many who work with patients who are seriously ill and dying recognize a persistent conspiracy of silence about dying.</p>
<p class="indent">How to communicate truthfully with patients and encourage patient <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;autonomy:&lt;/b&gt; self-determination; in the health care context, the right of the person to make choices about the use and discontinuation of medical interventions">autonomy</button></strong> (the right of the person to make choices) in a way that acknowledges where they are on the continuum of acceptance is a challenge. Despite continued reluctance of health care providers to engage in open discussion about end-of-life issues, patients want information about their illness and end-of-life choices and are not harmed by open discussion about death (<a href="#bib1220">Hamel, Wu, &#x0026; Brodie, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib1176">The Conversation Project National Survey, 2018</a>). Timing of sensitive discussion takes experience, but speaking the truth can be a relief to patients and families, enhancing their autonomy by making way for truly informed consent as the basis for decision making.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s447">Patient and Family Concerns</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Terminal illness is experienced uniquely by each person and their loved ones. Family members are key stakeholders in honoring patients&#x2019; wishes, caring for patients, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page389" title="389"></span>engaging in care planning. Family members are impacted by a loved one&#x2019;s illness and require support throughout the course of caregiving. Recognizing maladaptive coping in family members and providing resources for the family whether through social work staff or palliative care specialists is key to preventing worsening distress at the time of death. Palliative care interventions have been reported to improve communication, improve person-centeredness and decrease length of ICU stay without significantly impacting caregiver psychological distress (<a href="#bib1185">White, Angus, Shields, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patient and family awareness of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prognosis:&lt;/b&gt; the expected course of an illness and the chance for recovery">prognosis</button></strong> is a key factor in acceptance of and planning for death. For patients who have been informed about terminal illness, their understanding of treatment goals and prognosis is dynamic and may sometimes require reinforcement. Even when patients have been told that the intent of a therapy is palliative, they may think <em>I&#x2019;ll be the one to beat the odds.</em> As many as 37% of patients with metastatic cancer receiving palliative therapies misperceive their cancer as potentially curable (<a href="#bib1189">Yennurajalingam, Lu, Prado, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Just as patients and families may have differing perspectives on prognosis, they may also have different perceptions of severity of symptoms. Family caregivers tend to report distress and quality of life as worse than patient reports at the end-of-life (<a href="#bib1131">Hack, McClement, Chochinov, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). This may be due to the family member&#x2019;s distress or anticipatory grief.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, the approach in the United States to serious illness has been described as <em>death denying</em>&#x2014;that is, the health care system has been built on management of acute illness and the use of technology to cure (when possible) and to extend life. As a result, life-threatening illness, life-sustaining treatment decisions, dying, and death occur in a social environment in which illness is largely considered an enemy. Many common expressions reflect this dominant sociocultural view. For example, people talk about the <em>war</em> against cancer or <em>fighting</em> illness, and when patients choose not to pursue the most aggressive course of medical treatment available, many health care providers and indeed patients and families perceive this as <em>giving up</em>. A care/cure dichotomy has persisted in which health care providers may view cure as the ultimate good and care as second best, a good only when cure is no longer possible. In such a model, alleviating suffering is not as valued as curing disease. Patients who cannot be cured feel distanced from the health care team, and when curative treatments have failed, they may feel that they too have failed. Patients and families may fear that any shift from curative goals to comfort-focused care will result in no care or lower-quality care, and that the clinicians on whom they have come to rely will abandon them if they withdraw from a focus on cure.</p>
<p class="indent">The statement in late-stage illness that exemplifies this care versus cure dichotomy is <em>nothing more can be done</em>. This all-too-frequently used statement communicates the belief of many clinicians that there is nothing of value to offer patients beyond cure; however, in a care-focused perspective, there is always more that can be done. This expanded notion of healing implies that healing can take place throughout life. There are many opportunities for physical, spiritual, emotional, and social healing, even as body systems begin to fail at the end-of-life.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Issues of importance to professional caregivers include burnout, promoting resiliency, and nurses supporting themselves.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Burnout and Promoting Resiliency</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Burnout is defined as the triad of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and ineffectiveness at work. By the time one notices burnout it is usually too late. In order to prevent burnout, there is a body of work to promote resilience, thereby providing clinicians with the skills needed to have work&#x2013;life balance and the opportunity to remain productive and satisfied with their career (<a href="#bib1103">Back, Steinhauser, Kamal, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). See <a href="#tt13-8">Table&#x00A0;13-8</a> for select resiliency skills and workplace factors to prevent burnout.</p>
<p class="indent">While the prevalence of burnout among nurses working in palliative care and hospice is unknown, researchers have attempted to assess the prevalence of burnout among all clinicians working in palliative care. One study found that physicians were more likely to exhibit signs of burnout; however, factors for both physicians and clinicians from other disciplines (advanced practice provider, nurse, chaplain, social worker) that contributed to burnout are younger age, working weekends or overtime, and feeling isolated (<a href="#bib1141">Kamal, Bull, Wolf, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Overall, hospice and palliative clinicians were found to have a burnout rate of approximately 39% (<a href="#bib1141">Kamal et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The ANA (2017a) published <em>A Call to Action: Exploring Moral Resilience toward a Culture of Ethical Practice,</em> which highlights potential for burnout among nurses and makes recommendations for both individuals and institutions to foster resilience, as well as recommendations for research. This document also contains a toolkit for resources for the nurse and proposed actions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s449">Supporting Ourselves</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to healthy work environments that promote resiliency, nurses are often encouraged to develop self-care practices. Self-care can be any number of activities or practices that a person maintains while not at work; examples include practicing yoga or meditation, engaging in hobbies, or simply not checking email when away from work. A recent qualitative study found palliative care clinicians (primary providers and nurses) seek practices that promote well-being and allow restoration of self so as to better care for patients (<a href="#bib1150">Mills, Wand, &#x0026; Fraser, 2018</a>).<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page390" title="390"></span> The palliative care clinicians sought meaning through work&#x2013;life balance and building relationships; they sought self-care during work (such as establishing boundaries, negotiating workload, and reflecting on practice) and outside of work (such as meditation, rest, separating self from work, and positive social relationships) (<a href="#bib1150">Mills et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Whether practicing in a trauma center, ICU, or other acute care setting, home care, hospice, long-term care, or the many locations where patients and their families receive ambulatory services, nurses are closely involved with complex and emotionally laden issues surrounding loss of life. To be most effective and satisfied with the care they provide, nurses should attend to their own emotional responses to the losses witnessed every day. In hospice settings, where death, grief, and loss are expected outcomes of patient care, interdisciplinary colleagues rely on one another for support by learning coping skills from one another and speaking about how they were affected by the lives of those patients who have died. In many settings, staff members organize periodic memorial services to support bereaved families and other caregivers, who find comfort in joining one another to remember and celebrate the lives of patients.</p>
<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> Your patient is a 60-year-old woman with lung cancer who is hospitalized with increasing shortness of breath. She is currently receiving second-line chemotherapy treatment and recently completed palliative radiation to rib metastases. She lives with her husband and has two adult children who live out of state. As you are administering her morning medications, she asks, &#x201C;Why did God do this to me? What did I do to deserve this?&#x201D; How will you facilitate an interprofessional discussion to address the patient&#x2019;s spiritual concerns? What members of the interdisciplinary team are essential to include?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> Your patient is a 52-year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who is being evaluated for a lung transplant. He arrives at the lung transplant clinic with his friend from work. He is a security guard, but has been calling out frequently as he can&#x2019;t make hourly rounds. He lives alone in a two-story home with one bathroom on the second floor. Due to dyspnea on exertion, he has not been able to go upstairs and now sleeps on a recliner and hasn&#x2019;t showered in weeks. He has an estranged daughter whom he has not spoken to in over 10 years. Dyspnea also interferes with his appetite and he has been drinking sports drinks and eats fast food when his friends bring it over. How would you complete an evidence-based symptom assessment? What interventions would you consider to treat his dyspnea based on the evidence?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> You are a new hospice nurse in your third month making home hospice visits. Your patient is a 73-year-old woman who has had multiple strokes. She previously expressed to her family that she would not want to live on prolonged life support. She has four devoted children who have set up a schedule so that someone will be with her 24 hours a day. When you enter the room, the patient is somnolent with periods of apnea. Her daughter at the bedside tells you that her mother was screaming out last night, calling for her parents and trying to get out of bed. The daughter feels that her mother is more comfortable now. She is intermittently tearful as she talks with you. At one point she asks, &#x201C;Do you think she&#x2019;s angry with us? That must be why she was agitated last night. . . . I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t have listened to my siblings&#x2014;My mom wants to live!&#x201D; What stage of dying is this patient experiencing? How would you educate the daughter about stages of dying? How would you assess for bereavement needs?</p>
