<h4 class="h4" id="s72">Overview of Stress</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Each person operates at a certain level of adaptation and regularly encounters a certain amount of change. Such change is expected; it contributes to growth and enhances life. A stressor can upset this equilibrium. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stressor:&lt;/b&gt; an internal or external event or situation that creates the potential for physiologic, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral changes">stressor</button></strong> may be defined as an internal or external event or situation that creates the potential for physiologic, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral changes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s73">Types of Stressors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Stressors exist in many forms and categories. They may be described as physical, physiologic, or psychosocial. Physical stressors include cold, heat, and chemical agents; physiologic stressors include pain and fatigue. An example of a psychosocial stressor is fear (e.g., fear of failing an examination, losing a job, waiting for a diagnostic test result). Stressors can also occur as normal life transitions that require some adjustment, such as going from childhood into puberty, getting married, or giving birth.</p>
<p class="indent">Stressors have also been classified as day-to-day frustrations or hassles, major complex occurrences involving large groups, and stressors that occur less frequently and involve fewer people. Day-to-day stressors include common occurrences as getting caught in a traffic jam, experiencing computer downtime, and having an argument with a spouse or roommate. These experiences vary in effect. For example, encountering a rainstorm while you are vacationing at the beach will most likely evoke a more negative response than it might at another time. These daily hassles have been shown to have a greater health impact than major life events because of the cumulative effect they have over time. They can lead to high blood pressure, palpitations, or other physiologic problems (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib323">Sarid, Slonim-Nevo, Sergienko, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Terrill &#x0026; Molton, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Major stressors influence larger groups of individuals, families, and sometimes even entire nations. These include events of history, such as terrorism and war, experienced either directly in the war zone or indirectly through live news coverage. The demographic, economic, and technologic changes occurring in society also serve as stressors. The tension produced by any stressor is sometimes a result not only of the change itself, but also of the speed with which the change occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">Stressors concerning relatively infrequent situations that directly affect people have been studied extensively. This category includes the influence of life events such as death, birth, military service, marriage, divorce, and retirement. It also includes the psychosocial crises that occur in the life cycle stages of the human experience. More enduring chronic stressors may include having a permanent disability or coping with the need to provide long-term care for a child who has a developmental disability or for an older parent who is frail.</p>
<p class="indent">Duration may also be used to categorize stressors, as in the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>An acute, time-limited stressor, such as studying for final examinations</span></li>
<li><span>A stressor sequence&#x2014;a series of stressful events that result from an initial event such as job loss or divorce</span></li>
<li><span>A chronic intermittent stressor, such as daily hassles</span></li>
<li><span>A chronic enduring stressor that persists over time, such as chronic illness, a disability, or poverty</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s74">Stress as a Stimulus for Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Relating life events to illness (the theoretical approach that defines stress as a stimulus) has been a major focus of psychosocial studies. Research suggests that people under constant stress have a high incidence of disease (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Kalinowski, Taylor, &#x0026; Spruill, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib310">Kibler, Ma, Tursich, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Holmes and Rahe (1967) developed life events scales that assign numerical values, called <em>life-change units,</em> to typical life events. Because the items in the scales reflect events that require a change in a person&#x2019;s life pattern, and stress is viewed as an accumulation of changes in one&#x2019;s life that require psychological adaptation, one can theoretically predict the likelihood of illness by checking off the number of recent events and deriving a total score. The Recent Life Changes Questionnaire (RLCQ) (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib328">Tausig, 1982</a>) contains 118 items such as death, birth, marriage, divorce, promotions, serious arguments, and vacations. The items include both desirable and undesirable events. Both the life events scale and the RLCQ have formed the basis for the development of two additional scales: the Positive&#x2013;Negative Relationship Quality Scale (PNRQS) (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib306">Fincham &#x0026; Rogge, 2010</a>), which measures stress related to relationship quality, and the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Amirkhan, 2012</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Amirkhan, Urizar, &#x0026; Clark, 2015</a>), which measures excessive stress. A tool developed by Vohra and colleagues (2019) called the Stressometer<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (SOM) was designed to measure stress and mental health. This instrument is composed of subscales related to a person&#x2019;s individual nature, personal circumstances, clinical symptoms, home life and work life. The underlying premise of the PNRQS, SOS, and SOM instruments is that sources of stress, such as stressful life events and a person&#x2019;s personal vulnerabilities, can influence and even undermine engaging in adaptive processes.</p>
<p class="indent">Sources of stress for people have been well researched (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib298">Anniko, Boersma, &#x0026; Tillfors, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib320">Pitt, Oprescu, Tapia, et al., 2018</a>). People typically experience distress related to alterations in their physical and emotional health status, changes in their level of daily functioning, and decreased social support or the loss of significant others (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib294">Albdour, Hong, Lewin, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib301">Benham &#x0026; Charak, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib321">Reblin, Stanley, Galligan, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib325">Sikes &#x0026; Hall, 2017</a>). Fears of immobilization, isolation, loneliness, sensory changes, financial problems, and death or disability increase a person&#x2019;s anxiety level. Loss of one&#x2019;s role or perceived purpose in life can cause intense discomfort. Any of these identified variables, plus a myriad of other conditions or demands, are likely to cause ineffective coping, and a lack of effective coping skills is often a source of additional distress for the person. When a person endures prolonged or unrelenting suffering, the outcome is frequently the development of a stress-related illness. Nurses have the skills to assist people to alter their distressing circumstances and manage their responses to stress, as discussed later in the chapter.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s75">Psychological Responses to Stress</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After recognizing a stressor, a person consciously or unconsciously reacts to manage the situation. This is termed the <em>mediating process.</em> A theory developed by Lazarus (1991) emphasizes cognitive appraisal and coping as important mediators of stress. Appraisal and coping are influenced by antecedent variables, including the internal and external resources of the individual person.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Appraisal of the Stressful Event</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cognitive appraisal (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib288">Lazarus, 1991</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib289">Lazarus &#x0026; Folkman, 1984</a>) is a process by which an event is evaluated with respect to what is at stake (primary appraisal) and what might and can be done (secondary appraisal). What a person sees as being at stake is influenced by their personal goals, commitments, or motivations. Important factors include how important or relevant the event is to the person, whether the event conflicts with what the person wants or desires, and whether the situation threatens the person&#x2019;s own sense of strength and ego identity.</p>
<p class="indent">Primary appraisal results in the situation being identified as either nonstressful or stressful. Secondary appraisal is an evaluation of what might and can be done about the situation. Reappraisal&#x2014;a change of opinion based on new information&#x2014;may occur. The appraisal process is not necessarily sequential; primary and secondary appraisal and reappraisal may occur simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">The appraisal process contributes to the development of an emotion. Negative emotions such as fear and anger accompany harm/loss appraisals, and positive emotions accompany challenge. In addition to the subjective component or feeling that accompanies a particular emotion, each emotion also includes a tendency to act in a certain way. For example, unprepared students may view an unexpected quiz as threatening. They might feel fear, anger, and resentment and might express these emotions through hostile behavior or comments.</p>
<p class="indent">Lazarus (1991) expanded his initial ideas about stress, appraisal, and coping into a more complex model relating emotion to adaptation. He called this model a &#x201C;cognitive&#x2013;motivational&#x2013;relational theory,&#x201D; with the term <em>relational</em> &#x201C;standing for a focus on negotiation with a physical and social world&#x201D; (p. 13). A theory of emotion was proposed as the bridge to connect psychology, physiology, and sociology: &#x201C;More than any other arena of psychological thought, emotion is an integrative, organismic concept that subsumes psychological stress and coping within itself and unites motivation, cognition, and adaptation in a complex configuration&#x201D; (p. 40).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Coping with the Stressful Event</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;coping:&lt;/b&gt; the cognitive and behavioral strategies used to manage the stressors that tax a person&#x2019;s resources">Coping</button></strong> consists of the cognitive and behavioral efforts made to manage the specific external or internal demands that tax a person&#x2019;s resources and may be emotion focused or problem focused. Emotion-focused coping seeks to make the person feel better by lessening the emotional distress. Problem-focused coping aims to make direct changes in the environment so that the situation can be managed more effectively. Both types of coping usually occur in a stressful situation. Even if the situation is viewed as challenging or beneficial, coping efforts may be required to develop and sustain the challenge&#x2014;that is, to maintain the positive benefits of the challenge and to ward off any threats. In harmful or threatening situations, successful coping reduces or eliminates the source of stress and relieves the emotion generated.</p>
<p class="indent">Appraisal and coping are affected by internal characteristics such as health, energy, personal belief systems, commitments, or life goals, self-esteem, control, mastery, knowledge, problem-solving skills, and social skills. The characteristics that have been studied in nursing research are health-promoting lifestyles and resilience (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Callaghan, Fellin, &#x0026; Alexander, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib316">Marques, Perolta, Santos, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib324">Shen, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib326">Sima, Yu, Marwitz, et al., 2019</a>). Resilience is considered both a personal trait and a process. Researchers have defined resilience as the ability of a person to function well in stressful situations such as traumatic events and other types of adverse situations (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib311">Kim, Lin, Kim, et al., 2019</a>). A resilient person maintains flexibility even in difficult circumstances and controls strong emotional reactions using appropriate communication and problem-solving skills. Factors that play a role in building a person&#x2019;s resilience are having strong, supportive relationships with family members and other individuals and being exposed to positive role models. A resilient person knows when to act, when to step back and rely on others, and when to stop to re-energize and nurture the self. Researchers have found positive support for resilience as a significant variable that positively influences rehabilitation and overall improvement after a challenging or traumatic experience (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib314">Kok, Reed, Wickham, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib315">Liu, Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib318">McNeil, Bartram, Cregan, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib333">Vaughan, Koczwara, Kemp, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A health-promoting lifestyle buffers the effect of stressors. From a nursing practice standpoint, this outcome&#x2014;buffering the effect of stressors&#x2014;supports nursing&#x2019;s goal of promoting health. In many circumstances, promoting a healthy lifestyle is more achievable than altering the stressors.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s76">Physiologic Response to Stress</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The physiologic response to a stressor, whether it is physical, psychological, or psychosocial, is a protective and adaptive mechanism to maintain the body&#x2019;s homeostatic balance. When a stress response occurs, it activates a series of neurologic and hormonal processes within the brain and body systems. The duration and intensity of the stress can cause both short- and long-term effects.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Selye&#x2019;s Theory of Adaptation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Selye (1976) developed a theory of adaptation to biologic stress that profoundly influenced the scientific study of stress.</p>
<p class="h7">General Adaptation Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">Selye&#x2019;s theory, called the <em>General Adaptation Syndrome</em> (GAS), has three phases: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. During the alarm phase, the sympathetic <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fight-or-flight response:&lt;/b&gt; the alarm stage in the General Adaptation Syndrome described by Selye">fight-or-flight response</button></strong> is activated with release of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;catecholamines:&lt;/b&gt; any of the group of amines (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine) that serve as neurotransmitters">catecholamines</button></strong> (i.e., epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine), that serve as neurotransmitters and the onset of the <strong>adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</strong>&#x2013;adrenal cortical response. ACTH is produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and stimulates the secretion of cortisol as well as other hormones by the adrenal cortex. The alarm reaction is defensive and anti-inflammatory but self-limited. Because living in a continuous state of alarm would result in death, people move into the second stage&#x2014;resistance. During the resistance stage, adaptation to the noxious stressor occurs, and cortisol activity is still increased. If exposure to the stressor is prolonged, the third stage&#x2014;exhaustion&#x2014;occurs. During the exhaustion stage, endocrine activity increases, and this has negative effects on the body systems (i.e., the circulatory, digestive, and immune systems) that can lead to death. The first two stages of this syndrome are repeated, in different degrees, throughout life as the person encounters stressors.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 100</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page101" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="101">p. 101</span></div>
<p class="indent">Selye compared the GAS with the life process. During childhood, too few encounters with stress occur to promote the development of adaptive functioning, and children are vulnerable. During adulthood, numerous stressful events occur, and people develop resistance or adaptation. During the later years, the accumulation of life&#x2019;s stressors and wear and tear on the organism again decrease people&#x2019;s ability to adapt, resistance falls, and eventually death occurs.</p>
<p class="h7">Local Adaptation Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">According to Selye, a <em>Local Adaptation Syndrome</em> also occurs. This syndrome includes the inflammatory response and repair processes that occur at the local site of tissue injury. This syndrome occurs in small, topical injuries, such as contact dermatitis. If the local injury is severe enough, the GAS is activated as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Selye emphasized that stress is the nonspecific response common to all stressors, regardless of whether they are physiologic, psychological, or psychosocial. The many conditioning factors in each person&#x2019;s environment account for why different demands are experienced by different people as stressors. Conditioning factors also account for differences in the tolerance of different people for stress: Some people may develop diseases of adaptation, such as hypertension and migraine headaches, whereas others are unaffected.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Interpretation of Stressful Stimuli by the Brain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Physiologic responses to stress are mediated by the brain through a complex network of chemical and electrical messages. The neural and hormonal actions that maintain homeostatic balance are integrated by the hypothalamus, which is located in the center of the brain, surrounded by the limbic system and the cerebral hemispheres. The hypothalamus is made up of a number of nuclei and integrates autonomic nervous system mechanisms that maintain the chemical constancy of the internal environment of the body. Together with the limbic system, which contains the amygdala, hippocampus, and septal nuclei, along with other structures, the hypothalamus regulates emotions and many visceral behaviors necessary for survival (e.g., eating, drinking, temperature control, reproduction, defense, aggression).</p>
<p class="indent">Each of the brain structures responds differently to stimuli. The cerebral hemispheres are concerned with the cognitive functions of thought processes, learning, and memory. The limbic system has connections with both the cerebral hemispheres and the brain stem. In addition, the reticular activating system, a network of cells that forms a two-way communication system, extends from the brain stem into the midbrain and limbic system. This network controls the alert or waking state of the body.</p>
<p class="indent">In the stress response, afferent impulses are carried from sensory organs (eye, ear, nose, skin) and internal sensors (baroreceptors, chemoreceptors) to nerve centers in the brain. The response to the perception of stress is integrated in the hypothalamus, which coordinates the adjustments necessary to return to homeostatic balance. The degree and duration of the response vary; initially, there is a sympathetic nervous system discharge, followed by a sympathetic&#x2013;adrenal&#x2013;medullary discharge. If the stress persists, the hypothalamic-pituitary system is activated (<a href="#ff5-2">Fig.&#x00A0;5-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Sympathetic Nervous System Response</p>
<p class="nonindent">The sympathetic nervous system response is rapid and short-lived. Norepinephrine is released at nerve endings that are in direct contact with their respective end organs to cause an increase in function of the vital organs and a state of general body arousal (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>). Heart rate increases and peripheral vasoconstriction occurs, raising the blood pressure. Blood is also shunted away from abdominal organs. The purpose of these responses is to provide better perfusion of vital organs (brain, heart, skeletal muscles). Blood glucose is increased, supplying more readily available energy. The pupils dilate, and mental activity increases; a greater sense of awareness exists. Constriction of the blood vessels of the skin limits bleeding in the event of trauma. The person is likely to experience cold feet, clammy skin and hands, chills, palpitations, and &#x201C;knots&#x201D; in the stomach. Typically, the person appears tense, with the muscles of the neck, upper back, and shoulders tightened; respirations may be rapid and shallow, with the diaphragm tense.</p>
<p class="h7">Sympathetic&#x2013;Adrenal&#x2013;Medullary Response</p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to directly affecting major end organs, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine into the bloodstream. These hormones act similarly to the sympathetic nervous system, sustaining and prolonging its actions. Because these hormones are catecholamines, they stimulate the nervous system and produce metabolic effects that increase the blood glucose level and metabolic rate. The effect of the sympathetic&#x2013;adrenal&#x2013;medullary responses is summarized in <a href="#tt5-1">Table&#x00A0;5-1</a>. This effect is called the <em>fight-or-flight response</em> (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hypothalamic-Pituitary Response</p>
<p class="nonindent">The longest-acting phase of the physiologic response, which is more likely to occur in persistent stress, involves the hypothalamic-pituitary pathway. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing factor, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;corticosteroids:&lt;/b&gt; the group of steroid hormones, such as cortisol, that are produced by the adrenal cortex; they are involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and have anti-inflammatory properties">corticosteroids</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, primarily cortisol (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>). Cortisol stimulates protein catabolism, releasing amino acids; stimulates liver uptake of amino acids and their conversion to glucose (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gluconeogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; the formation of glucose by the liver from noncarbohydrate sources, such as amino acids and the glycerol portion of fats">gluconeogenesis</button></strong>); and inhibits glucose uptake (anti-insulin action) by many body cells but not those of the brain and the heart (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>). These cortisol-induced metabolic effects provide the body with a ready source of energy during a stressful situation. This effect has some important implications. For example, a person with diabetes who is under stress, such as that caused by an infection, needs more insulin than usual. Any patient who is under stress (e.g., illness, surgery, trauma, prolonged psychological stress) catabolizes body protein and needs supplements.</p>
<p class="indent">The actions of the catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and cortisol are the most important in the general response to stress. Other hormones that play a role are <strong>antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</strong> released from the posterior pituitary and aldosterone released from the adrenal cortex. ADH and aldosterone promote sodium and water retention, which is an adaptive mechanism in the event of hemorrhage or loss of fluids through excessive perspiration. ADH constricts blood vessels, elevates blood pressure, and reduces the excretion of urine. ADH has also been shown to influence learning and may thus facilitate coping in new and threatening situations. Secretion of growth hormone and glucagon stimulates the uptake of amino acids by cells, helping to mobilize energy resources. Endorphins, which are endogenous opioids, increase during stress and enhance the threshold for tolerance of painful stimuli. They may also affect mood and have been implicated in the so-called high that long-distance runners experience. The secretion of other hormones is also affected; however, their adaptive function is less clear.</p>

<p class="h7">Immunologic Response</p>
<p class="nonindent">The immune system is connected to the neuroendocrine and autonomic systems. Lymphoid tissue is richly supplied by autonomic nerves capable of releasing a number of different neuropeptides that can have a direct effect on leukocyte regulation and the inflammatory response. Neuroendocrine hormones released by the central nervous system and endocrine tissues can inhibit or stimulate leukocyte function. The various stressors a person experiences may result in different alterations in autonomic activity and subtle variations in neurohormone and neuropeptide synthesis. All of these possible autonomic and neuroendocrine responses can interact to initiate, weaken, enhance, or terminate an immune response.</p>
<p class="indent">The study of the relationships among the neuroendocrine system, the central and autonomic nervous systems, and the immune system and the effects of these relationships on overall health outcomes are called <em>psychoneuroimmunology.</em> Because one&#x2019;s perception of events and one&#x2019;s coping styles determine whether, and to what extent, an event activates the stress response system, and because the stress response affects immune activity, one&#x2019;s perceptions, ideas, and thoughts can have profound neurochemical and immunologic consequences. Some studies have demonstrated altered immune function in people who are under stress (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib300">Atkinson, Rodman, Thuras, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib304">Christensen, Flensborg-Madsen, Garde, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Frishman, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Ubel &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2019</a>). Other studies have identified certain personality traits, such as decisiveness, assertiveness, compassion, helpfulness, and conscientiousness, as having positive effects on health (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Antoni &#x0026; Dhabhar, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Champagne, 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib336">Wilson, Woody, Padin, et al., 2019</a>). As research continues, this field of study will likely uncover to what extent and by what mechanisms people can consciously influence their immunity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s77">Maladaptive Responses to Stress</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The stress response, as indicated earlier, facilitates adaptation to threatening situations and is retained from humans&#x2019; evolutionary past. The fight-or-flight response, for example, is an anticipatory response that mobilized the bodily resources of our ancestors to deal with predators and other harsh factors in their environment. This same mobilization comes into play in response to emotional stimuli unrelated to danger. For example, a person may get an &#x201C;adrenaline rush&#x201D; when competing over a decisive point in a ball game or when excited about attending a party.</p>
<p class="indent">When responses to stress are ineffective, they are referred to as <em>maladaptive.</em> Maladaptive responses are chronic, recurrent responses or patterns of response that do not promote the goals of adaptation. The goals of adaptation are somatic or physical health (optimal wellness); psychological health or having a sense of well-being (happiness, satisfaction with life, morale); and enhanced social functioning, which includes work, social life, and family (positive relationships). Maladaptive responses that threaten these goals include faulty appraisals and inappropriate coping (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib288">Lazarus, 1991</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The frequency, intensity, and duration of stressful situations contribute to the development of emotions and subsequent patterns of neurochemical discharge. By appraising situations adequately and coping appropriately, it is possible to anticipate and defuse some of these situations. For example, frequent stressful encounters (e.g., marital discord) might be avoided with better communication and problem solving, or a pattern of procrastination (e.g., delaying work on tasks) could be corrected to reduce stress when deadlines approach.</p>
<p class="indent">Coping processes that include the use of alcohol or drugs to reduce stress increase the risk of illness. Other inappropriate coping patterns may increase the risk of illness less directly. For example, people who demonstrate &#x201C;type A&#x201D; behaviors, including impatience, competitiveness, and achievement orientation, have an underlying aggressive approach to life. Type A behaviors increase the output of catecholamines, the adrenal&#x2013;medullary hormones, with their attendant effects on the body. Additional forms of inappropriate coping include denial, avoidance, and distancing.</p>
<p class="indent">Models of illness frequently include stress and maladaptation as precursors to disease. A general model of illness, based on Selye&#x2019;s theory, suggests that any stressor elicits a state of disturbed physiologic equilibrium. If this state is prolonged or the response is excessive, it increases the susceptibility of the person to illness. This susceptibility, coupled with a predisposition in the person (from genetic traits, health, or age), leads to illness. If the sympathetic&#x2013;adrenal&#x2013;medullary response is prolonged or excessive, a state of chronic arousal develops that may lead to high blood pressure, arteriosclerotic changes, and cardiovascular disease. If the production of ACTH is prolonged or excessive, behavior patterns of withdrawal and depression are seen. In addition, the immune response is decreased, and infections and tumors may develop.</p>
<p class="indent">Selye (1976) proposed a list of disorders known as diseases of maladaptation: high blood pressure (including hypertension of pregnancy), diseases of the heart and blood vessels, diseases of the kidney, rheumatic diseases and inflammatory diseases of the skin and eyes, infections, allergic and hypersensitivity diseases, nervous and mental diseases, sexual dysfunction, digestive diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Research continues on the complex interconnections between stress, coping (adaptive and maladaptive), and disease (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib330">Torkzadeh, Danesh, Mirbagher, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib331">Tormohlen, Tobin, &#x0026; Latkin, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s78">Indicators of Stress</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Indicators of stress and the stress response include both subjective and objective measures. <a href="#ct5-1">Chart&#x00A0;5-1</a> lists signs and symptoms that may be observed directly or reported by a person. They are psychological, physiologic, or behavioral and reflect social behaviors and thought processes. Some of these reactions may be coping behaviors. Over time, each person tends to develop a characteristic pattern of behavior during stress to warn that the system is out of balance.</p>

<p class="indent">Laboratory measurements of indicators of stress have helped in understanding this complex process. Blood and urine analyses can be used to demonstrate changes in hormonal levels and hormonal breakdown products. Blood levels of catecholamines, corticosteroids, ACTH, and eosinophils are reliable measures of stress. Serum cholesterol and free fatty acid levels can be used to measure stress. Distress can cause an increase in adrenal hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone, which can lead to high serum cholesterol levels. Both physical and psychological distress can trigger an elevated cholesterol level. In addition, the results of immunoglobulin assays are increased when a person is exposed to various stressors, especially infections and immune deficiency conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to using laboratory tests, researchers have developed questionnaires to identify and assess stressors, stress, and coping strategies. The work of Rice (2012) includes a compilation of information gained from research on stress, coping, and health, and includes some of these questionnaires.</p>
