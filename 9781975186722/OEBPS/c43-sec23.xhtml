<h4 class="h4a" id="s1859">CANCER OF THE LIVER</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatic tumors may be malignant or benign. Benign liver tumors were uncommon until oral contraceptives were in widespread use in western countries. Now, benign liver tumors such as hepatic adenomas occur most frequently in women in their reproductive years who are taking oral contraceptives, though the incidence has decreased with the development of modern contraceptives which contain less estrogen. The risk of these tumors is increased in those who are overweight or have obesity. These lesions may be complicated by hemorrhage and conversion to a malignant state (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3314">Tsilimigras, Rahnemai-Azar, Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
