<h4 class="h4" id="s1188">Antithrombin Deficiency</h4>
<p class="nonindent">AT is a protein that inhibits thrombin and certain coagulation factors. It may also play a role in reducing inflammation within the endothelium of blood vessels. AT deficiency can be acquired by four mechanisms: accelerated consumption of AT (as in DIC); decreased synthesis of AT (as in hepatic dysfunction); increased excretion of AT (as in nephrotic syndrome); and medication induced (e.g., estrogens) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Bunn &#x0026; Bauer, 2017</a>). However, AT deficiency is most often an inherited condition that can lead to venous thrombosis, especially when AT levels are less than 60% of normal. The most common sites of thrombosis are the deep veins in the legs and within the mesentery. Recurrent thrombosis can occur, particularly as patients age. Patients with AT deficiency may exhibit heparin resistance and therefore require greater doses of heparin to achieve adequate anticoagulation. Patients with AT deficiency should encourage their family members to be tested for the condition.</p>
