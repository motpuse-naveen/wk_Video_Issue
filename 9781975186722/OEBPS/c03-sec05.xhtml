<h4 class="h4" id="s44">Health Promotion Strategies Throughout the Lifespan</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Health promotion is a concept and a process that extends throughout the lifespan. The health of a child can be affected either positively or negatively by the health practices of the mother during the prenatal period. Therefore, health promotion starts before birth and extends through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Haber, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Health promotion includes health screening, counseling, immunizations, and preventive medications. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2019) evaluates clinical research to assess the merits of preventive measures. <a href="#tt3-3">Table&#x00A0;3-3</a> presents general population guidelines, including adult immunization recommendations (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib165">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib193">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s45">Adolescents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Health screening has traditionally been an important aspect of adolescent health care. The goal has been to detect health problems at an early age so that they can be treated at that time. Today, health promotion goes beyond the mere screening for illnesses and disability and includes extensive efforts to promote positive health practices at an early age. Because health habits and practices are formed early in life, adolescents should be encouraged to develop positive health attitudes. For this reason, more programs are being offered to adolescents to help them develop good health habits. Although the negative results of practices such as smoking, risky sex, misuse of drugs and alcohol, and poor nutrition are explained in these educational programs, emphasis is also placed on values training, self-esteem, and healthy lifestyle practices. The projects are designed to appeal to a particular age group, with emphasis on learning experiences that are fun, interesting, and relevant.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s46">Young and Middle-Aged Adults</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Young and middle-aged adults represent an age group that not only expresses an interest in health and health promotion but also responds enthusiastically to suggestions that show how lifestyle practices can improve health. Adults are frequently motivated to change their lifestyles in ways that are believed to enhance their health and wellness. Many adults who wish to improve their health turn to health promotion programs to help them make the desired changes in their lifestyles. Many have responded to programs that focus on topics such as general wellness, smoking cessation, exercise, physical conditioning, weight control, conflict resolution, and stress <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page67" title="67"></span>management. Because of the nationwide emphasis on health during the reproductive years, young adults actively seek programs that address prenatal health, parenting, family planning, and women&#x2019;s or men&#x2019;s health issues.</p>

<p class="indent">Programs that provide health screening, such as those that screen for cancer, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal aneurysm, and visual and hearing impairments, are quite popular with young and middle-aged adults. Programs that involve health promotion for people with specific chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and pulmonary disease are also popular. Chronic disease and disability do not preclude health and wellness; rather, positive health attitudes and practices can promote optimal health for people who must live with the limitations imposed by their chronic illnesses and disability.</p>
<p class="indent">Health promotion programs can be offered almost anywhere in the community, or in online venues. Common physical sites include local clinics, schools, colleges, recreation centers, places of worship, and even private homes. Health fairs are frequently held in civic centers and shopping malls. The outreach idea <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page68" title="68"></span>for health promotion programs has served to meet the needs of many adults who otherwise would not avail themselves of opportunities to strive toward a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p class="indent">The workplace has become a center for health promotion activity for several reasons. Employers have become increasingly concerned about the rising costs of health care insurance to treat illnesses related to lifestyle behaviors, and they are also concerned about increased absenteeism and lost productivity. Some employers use health promotion specialists to develop and implement these programs, some contract with employee assistance programs, and others purchase packaged programs that have already been developed by health care agencies or private health promotion corporations.</p>
<p class="indent">Programs offered at the workplace usually include employee health screening and counseling, physical fitness, nutritional awareness, work safety, and stress management and stress reduction. In addition, efforts are made to promote a safe and healthy work environment. Many large businesses provide exercise facilities for their employees and offer their health promotion programs to retirees.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s47"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Health promotion is as important for older adults as it is for others. Although 80% of people older than 65 years have one or more chronic illnesses and many are limited in their activity, the older adult population experiences significant gains from health promotion. Older adults are very health conscious, and most view their health positively and are willing to adopt practices that will improve their health and well-being (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Touhy &#x0026; Jett, 2018</a>). Although their chronic illness and disability cannot be eliminated, these adults can benefit from activities and education that help them maintain independence and achieve an optimal level of health (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib174">Harbottle, Bartholomaeus, Van Agteren, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

Here, a nurse teaches simple exercises at a senior center.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Various health promotion programs have been developed to meet the needs of older Americans. Both public and private organizations continue to be responsive to health promotion, and more programs that serve this population are emerging. Many of these programs are offered by health care agencies, places of worship, community centers, senior citizen residences, and various other organizations. The activities directed toward health promotion for older adults are the same as those for other age groups: physical fitness and exercise, nutrition, safety, and stress management (<a href="#ff3-2">Fig.&#x00A0;3-2</a>).</p>
