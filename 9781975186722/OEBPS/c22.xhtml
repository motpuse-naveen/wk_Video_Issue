<p class="nonindent">It is essential for the heart to have a regular rate and rhythm to perform efficiently as a pump to circulate oxygenated blood and other life-sustaining nutrients to all of the body&#x2019;s tissues and organs (including the heart itself). With an irregular or erratic rhythm, the heart is considered to be arrhythmic (also called <em>dysrhythmic</em>). This is a potentially dangerous condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses may encounter patients with arrhythmias in all health care settings, including primary care settings, skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation settings, hospitals, and the home health care setting. Some arrhythmias are acute and others chronic; some require emergent interventions, while others may not. Because patients with arrhythmias are frequently encountered in many different types of settings, nurses must be able to identify and provide appropriate first-line treatment of arrhythmias.</p>
