<h4 class="h4" id="s1507">Injuries to the Tendons, Ligaments, and Menisci</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1508">Rotator Cuff Tears</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A rotator cuff tear is a rip in a tendon that connects one of the rotator muscles to the humeral head. The rotator cuff stabilizes the humeral head and keeps the arm in the shoulder socket. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles that come together as tendons (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) that cover the head of the humerus, helping to raise and rotate the arm (AAOS, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Rotator cuff tears may result from acute or chronic stresses on the joint and from intrinsic (e.g., age-related) or extrinsic (e.g., overuse, fracture, etc.) factors. Physical examination should include bilateral evaluation of the joint. The patient complains of aching pain that is typically insidious in nature (unless related to an acute injury) and worsens with use. The patient will complain of tenderness to palpation and difficulty sleeping on the affected side and will exhibit decreased ROM and decreased strength. A thorough physical examination and imaging studies, including x-ray, MRI scan and musculoskeletal ultrasound, aid in confirming diagnosis and extent of injury (AAOS, 2019b; Simons, Dixon, &#x0026; Kruse, 2019). Arthrography with MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan may be more sensitive for certain tears but is usually reserved for cases when a labral injury is suspected (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Simons et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment options depend upon several factors, including the duration of symptoms, hand dominance, the type of tear, and patient characteristics such as age, general health, and activity level. Initial conservative management consists primarily of physical therapy, injury surveillance, NSAIDs, rest with modification of activities, and corticosteroid injections into the shoulder joint (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Simons et al., 2019</a>). If conservative methods fail, surgical management is warranted. Multiple surgical approaches (e.g., open, mini-open, and arthroscopic) can be employed. Selection of surgical modality is based upon the factors discussed above and the surgeon&#x2019;s preference as there is limited evidence whether surgery provides clinically important benefits (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2738">Karjalainen, Jain, Heikkinen, et al., 2019</a>). Postoperatively, the shoulder is immobilized with a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sling:&lt;/b&gt; bandage used to support an arm">sling</button></strong>, a supportive arm bandage, for 4 to 6 weeks; length of time of immobilization depends on the severity of injury. Physical therapy with shoulder exercises is begun as prescribed, and the patient is educated on how to perform the exercises at home. The course of rehabilitation is lengthy (e.g., 3 to 6 months); functionality post rehabilitation depends on the patient&#x2019;s commitment to the rehabilitation regimen (AAOS, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1509">Lateral and Medial Epicondylitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Epicondylitis is a chronic, painful condition that is caused by excessive, repetitive extension, flexion, pronation, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1155" title="1155"></span>supination motions of the forearm. These motions result in inflammation (tendonitis) and minor tears in the tendons at the origin of the muscles on the lateral or medial epicondyles. Lateral epicondylitis (e.g., tennis elbow) is frequently identified in someone who repeatedly extends the wrist with supination of the forearm. Patients complain of pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle and in the proximal wrist extensor muscles (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2698">Cutts, Gangoo, Modi, et al., 2020</a>). Medial epicondylitis (e.g., golfer&#x2019;s elbow) is consistent with repetitive wrist flexion and pronation of the forearm. Extreme tenderness occurs at the medial epicondyle and in the proximal wrist flexor muscles (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Neeru, 2020</a>). Lateral epicondylitis is seven times more common than its medial counterpart (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Cutts et al., 2020</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Does Informed Consent Always Uphold Autonomy?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">D.N. is a 27-year-old man brought by ambulance to the emergency department (ED) where you work as a staff nurse. You are his admitting nurse. Paramedics bring him to the trauma bay by stretcher; he is sitting upright, alert and fully oriented, breathing room air, and gripping his right elbow in flexion with his left hand, holding his right arm slightly away from his torso. The right arm has had a sling applied. As you approach him, you can hear him groaning and see that his forehead is diaphoretic. You see an obvious deformity at his right shoulder, which is slumped, and observe a bulge below his right clavicle, which is likely his dislocated right humeral head. The ED physician meets you and D.N. in the trauma bay and tells D.N. that he could send him to x-ray to confirm that his right shoulder is dislocated and to ensure he does not have any associated fractures; however, that will delay his treatment and fractures are very uncommon occurrences when shoulders dislocate in young men. The ED physician asks D.N. if he can attempt to correct his dislocation manually first, and that if that does not work, he will send him to x-ray. D.N. agrees that the ED physician may correct his dislocation; the physician begins to quickly note the risks associated with this manual procedure and procures an informed consent for D.N. to sign. D.N. blurts out &#x201C;Oh for heaven&#x2019;s sakes just fix my shoulder!&#x201D; as he scribbles a jumbled signature on the form with his nondominant left hand. The ED physician quickly and efficiently reduces the dislocated shoulder, and D.N. immediately sighs with relief and says &#x201C;Oh thank you, doctor! You are a miracle worker!&#x201D; After you send D.N. to radiology for a follow-up x-ray, the physician turns to you and says &#x201C;What a crock about these consents. Was that patient really going to not consent to have me try to fix his shoulder? It is just useless paperwork that takes additional time, and that poor guy had to needlessly suffer those extra minutes while we got that paperwork signed!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Obtaining informed consent from a patient prior to any procedure that incurs any risk is a legal requirement. The informed consent must clearly identify what is going to be done and what adverse consequences may ensue from the procedure. The informed consent must meet a <em>professional standard</em> so that it includes information that most other health care professionals would disclose during the informed consent process. Furthermore, the informed consent must also meet the <em>reasonable patient standard,</em> meaning that information is shared that the patient needs to know in order to make a decision whether or not to have the procedure performed. The informed consent process is considered central to ensuring patient autonomy.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">However, some bioethicists have asserted that patients who have had a traumatic injury many times do not remember information shared during the informed consent process. They counter that because of pain, fear, and anxiety, patients with trauma are not focused on the actual risks associated with treatments. Therefore, these bioethicists note that the informed consent process with patients with trauma is actually a sham process and fundamentally does little to preserve patient self-determination.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). In most instances, the principle of autonomy is considered preeminent. In this case, are the principles of beneficence or nonmaleficence of more importance?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Think about what the ED physician said about the informed consent process for D.N. Were there any benefits to D.N. by upholding the informed consent process? What risks could D.N. have incurred if there had not been an informed consent process?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What if D.N. does indeed have a fracture associated with his dislocated shoulder? What risks are there to the ED physician or to you had you not ensured an informed consent occurs?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be mobilized to be of assistance to you, the ED physician, and to D.N. so that D.N.&#x2019;s autonomy is upheld and he can be assured the best treatment options?</p>

<p class="indent">To date, there is no universally accepted regimen of treatment (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Cutts et al., 2020</a>); however, some general principles can be considered. Rest and cessation of aggravating actions is the first-line treatment. Intermittent application of ice and administration of NSAIDs usually relieve the pain and inflammation. In some instances, the arm is immobilized in a molded splint for support and pain relief. Local injection of corticosteroids may be used for symptom management, but because of its degenerative effects on tendons, this treatment is traditionally reserved for patients with severe pain who do not respond to first-line treatment methods (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Lenoir, Mares, &#x0026; Carlier, 2019</a>). Physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises are also considered first-line, nonsurgical treatments (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2748">Lai, Erickson, Mlynarek, et al., 2018</a>). Multiple electrophysical modalities, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), and laser therapy, may provide limited benefit; however, more research is needed to validate their efficacy (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Cutts et al., 2020</a>). Surgical interventions are typically a last resort and can be considered in patients who have no response to nonoperative management, want faster symptom management, or have severe pain (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Lenoir et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1510">Lateral and Medial Collateral Ligament Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lateral and medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) of the knee (see <a href="#ff37-1">Fig. 37-1</a>) provide stability to the knee. Injury to these ligaments occurs when the foot is firmly planted and the knee is struck&#x2014;either medially, causing stretching and tearing injury to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), or laterally, causing stretching and tearing injury to the MCL. The patient experiences an acute onset of pain, joint tenderness, joint instability, and inability to walk without assistance.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1511">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Early management includes the RICE method, use of analgesics, and protection of the joint from further injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dexter, 2019</a>). The joint is evaluated for fracture. Hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint) may develop, contributing to the pain; should this occur, the joint fluid may be aspirated to relieve pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment depends on the severity of the injury. Conservative management includes weight bearing as tolerated and the use of a hinged-brace for support. Crutches may be indicated to assist ambulation until weight bearing can be tolerated. Exercises to strengthen the supportive muscles to the knee without straining the ligaments are beneficial. Severe MCL injuries are initially treated with non&#x2013;weight-bearing status with progression to weight bearing as tolerated in a hinged-brace for a lengthy timeframe; the healing process may take 8 to 12 weeks. Severe LCL injuries with knee instability usually require surgical intervention, followed by bracing and physical therapy (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Agranoff, 2019</a>). A progressive rehabilitation program helps restore the function and strength of the knee. Rehabilitation occurs over many months, and the patient may need to wear a derotational brace while engaging in sports to prevent recurrence of injury.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1512">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient about proper use of ambulatory devices, the healing process, and activity limitation to promote healing. Education addresses pain management, the use of analgesic agents, the use of a brace, wound care, cold therapy, signs and symptoms of possible complications (e.g., altered neurovascular status, infection, skin breakdown, venous thromboembolism [VTE]), and self-care (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dexter, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1513">Cruciate Ligament Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) of the knee stabilize anterior and posterior motion of the tibia articulating with the femur (see <a href="#ff37-1">Fig. 37-1</a>A). These ligaments cross each other in the center of the knee. Injury occurs when the foot is firmly planted and the leg sustains direct force, either forward or backward. If the force is forward, the ACL suffers the impact from the force, whereas backward force places force on the PCL. The injured person may report feeling and hearing a &#x201C;pop&#x201D; in the knee with this injury. If the patient exhibits significant swelling of the joint within 2 hours after the injury, the ACL or PCL may be torn. A torn cruciate ligament produces pain, joint instability, and pain with weight bearing. Immediate postinjury management includes the RICE protocol, use of NSAIDs, and stabilization of the joint until it is evaluated for a fracture (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Graham, 2019</a>). Severe joint effusion and hemarthrosis may require joint aspiration and wrapping with an elastic compression dressing. Crutches may be needed to avoid weight bearing, especially if the knee is unstable (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Friedberg, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment depends on the severity of the injury, patient characteristics, and the effect of the injury on daily activities. Ligament injuries can be managed operatively or nonoperatively; most active, younger patients and high performing athletes opt for surgery due to the risk for reinjury and osteoarthritis (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Friedberg, 2019</a>). Older and less active patients, whose physical activity is community ambulation, tend to benefit from nonsurgical therapy (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Graham, 2019</a>). Surgical ACL or PCL reconstruction may be scheduled after near-normal joint ROM is achieved and includes tendon repair using a graft (e.g., autograft, allograft, or synthetic ligament; see later discussions). This is typically performed as ambulatory arthroscopic surgery, a procedure in which the surgeon uses an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;arthroscope:&lt;/b&gt; surgical scope inserted into a joint to examine or repair">arthroscope</button></strong> to visualize and repair the damage. After surgery, the patient is instructed to control pain with oral analgesic medications and cryotherapy (e.g., a cooling pad incorporated in a dressing). The patient and family are educated about monitoring the neurovascular status of the leg, wound care, and signs of complications (e.g., infection, VTE) that need to be reported promptly to the surgeon (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Cox, 2017</a>). Exercises (ankle pumps, quadriceps sets, and hamstring sets) are encouraged during the early postoperative period. The patient must protect the graft by adhering to exercise restrictions. The physical therapist supervises progressive ROM and weight bearing (as permitted).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1514">Meniscal Injuries</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Within the knee are two semilunar (crescent-shaped) pads of fibrocartilages, called <em>menisci,</em> located on the right and left side of the proximal tibia, between the tibia and the femur (see <a href="#ff37-1">Fig. 37-1</a>B). These structures act as shock absorbers in the knee. Normally, little twisting movement is permitted in the knee joint. Forceful twisting of the knee or repetitive squatting and impact may result in either tearing or detachment of the cartilage from its attachment to the head of the tibia. The peripheral third of the menisci have a small amount of blood flow, which allows that portion to heal if torn.</p>
<p class="indent">These injuries leave loose cartilage in the knee joint that may slip between the femur and the tibia, preventing full extension of the leg. If this happens during walking or running, the patient often describes the leg as &#x201C;giving way.&#x201D; The patient may hear or feel a click in the knee when walking, especially when extending the leg that is bearing weight. When the cartilage is attached to the front and back of the knee but torn loose laterally (bucket-handle tear), it may slide between the bones to lie between the condyles and prevent full flexion or extension. As a result, the knee &#x201C;locks.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">When a meniscus is torn, the synovial membrane secretes additional synovial fluid due to the irritation, and the knee becomes very edematous. Initial conservative management includes rest and immobilization of the knee, ice to the knee for 15 minutes every 4 to 6 hours, the use of crutches for support, anti-inflammatory agents, analgesic agents, and modification of activities to avoid those that cause the symptoms. Home exercises and physical therapy may be prescribed to increase strength in supporting muscles (e.g., quadriceps, hamstrings). Diagnosis is confirmed through MRI or arthroscopy; the approach to treatment depends on the patient&#x2019;s age, type of tear, associated mechanical symptoms (e.g., knee is locked, or motion is severely impaired) and the presence of persistent knee effusions (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Cardone &#x0026; Jacobs, 2019</a>). Surgical options include a partial or total meniscectomy to repair the meniscal tissue. Open or arthroscopic surgery can be performed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Baker, Wolf, &#x0026; Lubowitz, 2018</a>). The most common complication is an effusion into the knee joint, which produces pain. To ensure independent home performance, the patient is instructed to continue quadriceps strengthening and progressive ROM exercises; neuromuscular electrical stimulation/biofeedback is also recommended (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2753">Logerstedt, Snyder-Mackler, Ritter, et al., 2018</a>). There is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal postoperative time to return to activity; therefore, prescribed weight-bearing status can range from non&#x2013;weight bearing for 4 to 6 weeks to full weight bearing in a &#x201C;locked&#x201D; (extension) knee brace (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2793">Spang, Nasr, Mohamadi, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1515">Rupture of the Achilles Tendon</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Achilles tendon is a tough band of fibrous tissue that attaches the soleus and gastrocnemius (e.g., calf) muscles to the calcaneus (e.g., heel bone). Injury to the Achilles tendon is often multifactorial; despite being the strongest and thickest tendon in the body, it is vulnerable to injury due to its limited blood supply and the high tensions placed upon it (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Egger &#x0026; Berkowitz, 2017</a>). Rupture of the Achilles tendon most commonly occurs in active young to middle-aged adults with a predilection among males. The traumatic rupture of the Achilles tendon occurs with the &#x201C;pushing off&#x201D; or unexpected dorsiflexion of the foot and ankle (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2657">Karlsson Westin, Carmont, et al., 2019</a>). Patients usually describe a &#x201C;popping&#x201D; sound or a &#x201C;giving way&#x201D; sensation in their posterior heel. Immediate pain is usually experienced but gradually subsides, leaving a patient with difficulty performing plantar flexion, and the inability to fully bear weight on the affected leg (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Egger &#x0026; Berkowitz, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical examination is paramount in diagnosis; the ability to plantar flex is decreased and to dorsiflex is improved. MRI or ultrasound is indicated to determine the extent of the injury. The decision of surgical or nonsurgical treatment for Achilles tendon rupture is much debated and depends on the patient&#x2019;s comorbidities, goals, and preferences (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Karlsson et al., 2019</a>). Nonoperative modalities include cast immobilization for 2 to 8 weeks; there is some controversy regarding optimal time. After immobilization with the cast, a boot and functional brace with a heel lift is worn with increasing weight-bearing status. Progressive physical therapy to promote ankle ROM and strength is implemented as well. Operative treatment has typically been reserved for young, healthy athletes, because surgery was associated with fewer cases of re-rupture. After surgery, a cast may be initially used to immobilize the ankle joint; however, early functional rehabilitation has been shown to be superior to cast immobilization in terms of patient satisfaction and the time to return to prior employment and sporting activity (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2807">Zhao, Meng, Liu, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The total rehabilitation is approximately 6&#x00A0;weeks (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Karlsson et al., 2019</a>).</p>
