<h4 class="h4" id="s810">Analyzing the Electrocardiogram Rhythm Strip</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The ECG rhythm strip must be analyzed in a systematic manner to determine the patient&#x2019;s cardiac rate and rhythm, and to detect arrhythmias and conduction disorders, as well as evidence of myocardial ischemia, injury, and infarction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s811">Determining Heart Rate from the Electrocardiogram</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Heart rate can be obtained from the ECG rhythm strip by several methods. A 1-minute rhythm strip contains 300 large boxes and 1500 small boxes. Therefore, an easy and accurate method of determining heart rate with a regular rhythm is to count the number of small boxes within an RR interval and divide 1500 by that number. If, for example, there are 10 small boxes between two R waves, the heart rate is 1500/10, or 150 bpm; if there are 25 small boxes, the heart rate is 1500/25, or 60 bpm (see <a href="#ff22-4">Fig.&#x00A0;22-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative but less accurate method for estimating heart rate, which is usually used when the rhythm is irregular, is to count the number of RR intervals in 6 seconds and multiply that number by 10. The top of the ECG paper is usually marked at 3-second intervals, which is 15 large boxes horizontally. The RR intervals are counted, rather than QRS complexes, because a computed heart rate based on the latter might be inaccurately high.</p>
<p class="indent">The same methods may be used for determining atrial rate, using the PP interval instead of the RR interval.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s812">Determining Heart Rhythm from the Electrocardiogram</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The rhythm is often identified at the same time the rate is determined. <a href="#ct22-1">Chart&#x00A0;22-1</a> provides an example of a method that can be used to analyze the patient&#x2019;s rhythm. The RR interval is used to determine ventricular rhythm and the PP interval to determine atrial rhythm. If the intervals are the same or if the difference between the intervals is less than 0.8 seconds throughout the strip, the rhythm is called <em>regular.</em> If the intervals are different, the rhythm is called <em>irregular.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Once the rhythm has been analyzed, the findings are compared with and matched to the ECG criteria for arrhythmias to determine a diagnosis. It is important for the nurse not only to identify the arrhythmia, but also to assess the patient to determine the physiologic effect of the arrhythmia and identify possible causes. Treatment of an arrhythmia is based on clinical evaluation of the patient with identification of the arrhythmia&#x2019;s etiology and physiologic effect, not on its presence on ECG alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Most cardiac monitoring has functionality that includes the ability to continuously monitor the rhythm and alert health care personnel with an auditory and visual alarm when a clinically significant change in the rhythm occurs. However, a high rate of triggered, clinically insignificant alarms may lead to alarm fatigue, which has been linked to nurses ignoring, disabling, or silencing alarms (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Sendelbach &#x0026; Jepsen, 2018</a>)&#x2014;putting patients at increased risk of adverse events.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>It is vital that the nurse assesses the cause(s) of a cardiac monitor&#x2019;s alarm and then adjusts the alarm default settings and individualizes the alarm parameter limits and levels. The assessment should also include an evaluation and discussion with the primary provider to validate that the patient needs to remain on continuous cardiac monitoring.</em></p></div>
