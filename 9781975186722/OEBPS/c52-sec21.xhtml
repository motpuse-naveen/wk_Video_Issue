<p class="nonindent">Breast reconstruction surgery, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mammoplasty:&lt;/b&gt; surgery to reconstruct or change the size or shape of the breast; can be performed for reduction or augmentation">mammoplasty</button></strong>, is an elective procedure that can enhance a woman&#x2019;s self-image and sense of well-being. Women desire reconstruction for a variety of physical and psychological reasons. Therefore, it is important for the health care team to conduct a thorough assessment prior to reconstructive surgery to evaluate the woman&#x2019;s underlying desire, motivation, and expectations. Preparing a woman realistically could help her to avoid potential disappointment. A variety of reconstructive options are available today for women who desire a correction in the size or the shape of the breast, including reduction mammoplasty (breast reduction), augmentation mammoplasty (breast enlargement), and mastopexy (breast lift). Several options are also available to reconstruct the breast after a mastectomy.</p>
