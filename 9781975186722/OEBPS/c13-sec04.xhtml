<h4 class="h4" id="s438">Providing Psychosocial and Spiritual Support</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients suffer unnecessarily when they do not receive adequate attention for the symptoms accompanying serious illness. Careful evaluation of the patient should include not only the physical problems but also the psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s experience of serious illness. This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s life has been affected by illness and leads to nursing care that addresses their needs in every dimension.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s439">Hope and Meaning in Illness</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinicians and researchers have observed that although specific hopes may change over time, hope generally persists in some form across every stage of illness. In terminal illness, hope represents the patient&#x2019;s imagined future, forming the basis of a positive, accepting attitude and providing the patient&#x2019;s life with meaning, direction, and optimism. When hope is viewed in this way, it is not limited to cure of the disease; instead, it focuses on what is achievable in the time remaining. Many patients find hope in working on important relationships and creating legacies. Patients who are terminally ill can be extremely resilient, reconceptualizing hope repeatedly as they approach the end-of-life.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous nurse researchers have studied the concept of hope, and they have related its presence to spirituality, quality of life, and transcendence (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Tarbi &#x0026; Meghani, 2019</a>). Hope is a multidimensional construct that provides comfort as a person endures life threats and personal challenges. The following are hope-fostering and hope-hindering activities among patients who are terminally ill and in hospice with various diagnoses:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Hope-fostering categories:</em> Love of family and friends, spirituality/faith, setting goals and maintaining independence, positive relationships with clinicians, humor, personal characteristics, and uplifting memories</span></li>
<li><span><em>Hope-hindering categories:</em> Abandonment and isolation, uncontrollable pain/discomfort, and devaluation of personhood</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Nurses can support hope for the patient and the family by using effective listening and communication skills, thus encouraging realistic hope that is specific to their needs for information, expectations for the future, and values and preferences concerning the end-of-life. Nurses must engage in self-reflection and identify their own biases and fears concerning illness, life, and death. As nurses become more skilled in working with patients who are seriously ill, they can become less determined to <em>fix</em> and more willing to listen; more comfortable with silence, grief, anger, and sadness; and more fully present with patients and their families.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing interventions for enabling and supporting hope include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Answering questions about illness in terms the patient understands</span></li>
<li><span>Listening attentively</span></li>
<li><span>Encouraging sharing of feelings</span></li>
<li><span>Providing accurate information</span></li>
<li><span>Encouraging and supporting patients&#x2019; control over their circumstances, choices, and environment whenever possible</span></li>
<li><span>Assisting patients to explore ways for finding meaning in their lives</span></li>
<li><span>Facilitating effective communication within families</span></li>
<li><span>Making referrals for psychosocial and spiritual counseling</span></li>
<li><span>Assisting with the development of supports in the home or community when none exist</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s440">Providing Culturally Sensitive Care at the End-of-Life</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses are responsible for educating patients and their caregivers and for supporting them as they adapt to life with the illness. Nurses can assist patients and families with life review, values clarification, treatment decision making, and end-of-life goals. The only way to do this effectively is to try to appreciate and understand the illness from the patient&#x2019;s perspective.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse&#x2019;s role is to assess the values, preferences, and practices of every patient, regardless of ethnicity, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or background. The nurse can share knowledge about a patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s cultural beliefs and practices with the health care team and facilitate the adaptation of the care plan to accommodate these practices.</p>
<p class="indent">Although death, grief, and mourning are universally accepted aspects of living, the values, expectations, and practices during serious illness as death approaches and after death are culturally bound and expressed. Health care providers may share similar values concerning end-of-life care and may find that they are inadequately prepared to assess for and implement care plans that support culturally diverse perspectives. Historical mistrust of the health care system and unequal access to even basic medical care may underlie the beliefs and attitudes among ethnically diverse populations. In addition, lack of education or knowledge about end-of-life care treatment options and language barriers may influence decisions among many socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should be both culturally aware and sensitive in their approaches to communication with patients and families about death. To provide effective patient- and family-centered care at the end-of-life, nurses must be willing to set aside their own assumptions and attitudes so that they can discover what type and amount of disclosure is most meaningful to each <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page383" title="383"></span>patient and family within their unique belief systems. For example, a nurse may find that a female patient prefers to have her eldest son make all of her care decisions. Institutional practices and laws governing informed consent are also rooted in the Western notion of autonomous decision making and informed consent. If a patient wishes to defer decisions to her son, the nurse can work with the team to negotiate informed consent, respecting the patient&#x2019;s right not to participate in decision making and honoring her family&#x2019;s cultural practice.</p>
<p class="indent">Every person has unique needs at the end-of-life and deserves to be respected as a person. Those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer may need special attention to psychological stressors of serious illness and ACP to designate a preferred surrogate, as this may be outside of the biologic family. An additional concern for some transgender patients is loss of identity after death; for instance, not being buried in clothes of their preferred gender or honored with the name they chose (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1133">Higgins &#x0026; Hynes, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should assess and document the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s specific beliefs, preferences, and practices regarding end-of-life care, preparation for death, and after-death rituals. <a href="#ct13-8">Chart&#x00A0;13-8</a> identifies suggested language for cultural and spiritual assessment. The discomfort of novice nurses with asking questions and discussing this type of sensitive content can be reduced by prior practice in a classroom or clinical skills laboratory, observation of interviews conducted by experienced nurses, and partnering with experienced nurses during the first few assessments.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s441">Spiritual Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Attention to the spiritual component of the illness experienced by the patient and the family is not new within the context of nursing care, yet many nurses lack the comfort or skills to assess and intervene in this dimension. Spirituality contains features of religiosity; however, the two concepts are not interchangeable. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spirituality:&lt;/b&gt; connectedness with self, others, a life force, or God that allows people to find meaning in life">Spirituality</button></strong> includes domains such as how a person derives meaning and purpose from life, one&#x2019;s beliefs and faith, sources of hope, and attitudes toward death (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Puchalski, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The spiritual assessment is a key component of comprehensive nursing assessment for patients who are terminally ill and their families. While the nursing assessment should include religious affiliation, the nurse keeps in mind that spirituality is a broader concept than just religion (see <a href="#ct13-8">Chart&#x00A0;13-8</a>). In addition to the assessment of the role of religious faith and practices, important religious rituals, and connection to a religious community, the nurse should further explore:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The harmony or discord between the patient&#x2019;s and the family&#x2019;s beliefs</span></li>
<li><span>Other sources of meaning, hope, and comfort</span></li>
<li><span>The presence or absence of a sense of peace of mind and purpose in life</span></li>
<li><span>Spiritual or religious beliefs about illness, medical treatment, and care of the sick</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">A four-step spiritual assessment process using the acronym FICA involves asking the following questions (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Puchalski &#x0026; Romer, 2000</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>F</em>aith and belief: Do you consider yourself to be a spiritual or religious person? What is your <em>faith</em> or belief? What gives your life meaning?</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">For most people, contemplating one&#x2019;s own death raises many issues, such as the meaning of existence, the purpose of suffering, and the existence of an afterlife. When faced with a grave prognosis, many patients experience spiritual or existential distress where a sense of meaning or purpose is lost. Other manifestations of spiritual distress include questioning or blaming their god. Nurses may identify distress when patients ask questions like, &#x201C;Why me?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Why is God punishing me?&#x201D; When hearing such questions, nurses should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page384" title="384"></span>engage a spiritual care provider. Near the end-of-life, many draw strength from religion and spirituality and may turn to spiritual care providers for support; however, one study showed that 75% of clergy want more education surrounding end-of-life issues (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1168">Sanders, Chow, Enzinger, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Nurses may be perfectly poised to deliver point-of-care education to spiritual care providers. Further, the interdisciplinary team can organize a debriefing session to enrich education for all disciplines.</p>
<p class="indent">Another phenomenon associated with spirituality at the end-of-life is spiritual pain, defined as a pain deep in one&#x2019;s soul not manifested as physical symptoms, which may be experienced in the seriously ill. Although prevalence is not known in all illnesses, in those with advanced cancer as many as 67% of patients may experience spiritual pain, which is correlated with lower quality of life (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1161">Perez-Cruz, Langer, Carrasco, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s442">Grief, Mourning, and Bereavement</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of feelings and behaviors are normal, adaptive, and healthy reactions to the loss of a loved one. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;grief:&lt;/b&gt; personal feelings that accompany an anticipated or actual loss">Grief</button></strong> refers to the personal feelings that accompany an anticipated or actual loss; see <a href="#tt13-7">Table&#x00A0;13-7</a> for types of grief. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mourning:&lt;/b&gt; individual, family, group, and cultural expressions of grief and associated behaviors">Mourning</button></strong> refers to individual, family, group, and cultural expressions of grief and associated behaviors. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bereavement:&lt;/b&gt; period during which mourning for a loss takes place">Bereavement</button></strong> refers to the period of time during which mourning for a loss takes place. Both grief reactions and mourning behaviors change over time as people learn to live with the loss. Although the pain of the loss may be tempered by the passage of time, loss is an ongoing developmental process, and time does not heal the bereaved person completely. That is, the bereaved do not get over a loss entirely, nor do they return to who they were before the loss. Rather, they develop a new sense of who they are and where they fit in a world that has changed dramatically and permanently.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Anticipatory Grief and Mourning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">People experience grief in different ways. K&#x00FC;bler-Ross (1969) originally described five stages of grief including (1) denial, (2) anger, (3) bargaining, (4) depression, and (5) acceptance. Newer models of grief acknowledge that grieving is not a linear process and many more emotions may be present than originally identified by K&#x00FC;bler-Ross. Additionally, people many feel conflicting emotions, such as hope and guilt when thinking about the future, at the same time. The Dual Process Model (<a href="#ff13-3">Fig.&#x00A0;13-3</a>) of coping with bereavement allows oscillation between the loss-oriented process and the restoration-oriented process (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1171">Stroebe &#x0026; Schut, 1999</a>). The Dual Process Model assumes fluidity in bereavement and normalizes the individual experience by offering that people will experience competing and complicated emotions after the death of a loved one.</p>
<p class="indent">Individual and family coping with the anticipation of death is complicated by the varied and conflicting trajectories that grief and mourning may assume in families. For example, the patient may be experiencing sadness while contemplating role changes that have been brought about by the illness, and the patient&#x2019;s spouse or partner may be expressing or suppressing feelings of anger about the current changes in role and impending loss of the relationship. Others in the family may cope with fear using withdrawal. Each person copes in their own way as there is no <em>right</em> way to cope.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should assess the characteristics of the family system and intervene in a manner that supports and enhances the cohesion of the family unit. The nurse can suggest that family members talk about their feelings and understand them in the broader context of anticipatory grief and mourning. Acknowledging and expressing feelings, continuing to interact with the patient in meaningful ways, and planning for the time of death and bereavement are adaptive family behaviors. Professional support provided by grief counselors, whether in the community, at a local hospital, in the long-term care facility, or associated with a hospice program, can help both the patient and the family sort out and acknowledge feelings and make the end-of-life as meaningful as possible.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Grief and Mourning After Death</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When a loved one dies, family members enter a new phase of grief and mourning as they begin to accept the loss, feel the pain of permanent separation, and prepare to live a life without the deceased. Even if the loved one dies after a long illness, preparatory grief experienced during the terminal illness does not preclude the grief and mourning that follow the death. With a death after a long or difficult illness, family members may experience conflicting feelings of relief that the loved one&#x2019;s suffering has ended, compounded by guilt and grief <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page385" title="385"></span>related to unresolved issues or the circumstances of death. Grief work may be especially difficult if a patient&#x2019;s death was painful, prolonged, accompanied by unwanted interventions, or unattended. Families that had no preparation or support during the period of imminent death may have a more difficult time finding a place for the painful memories.</p>

<p class="indent">Feelings of grief are often profound; however, bereaved people eventually reconcile the loss and find a way to reengage with their lives. Grief and mourning are affected by several factors, including individual characteristics, coping skills, and experiences with illness and death; the nature of the relationship to the deceased; factors surrounding the illness and the death; family dynamics; social support; and cultural expectations and norms.</p>
<p class="indent">After-death rituals, including preparation of the body, funeral practices, and burial rituals, are socially and culturally significant ways in which family members begin to accept the reality and finality of death. Preplanning of funerals is common, and hospice professionals, in particular, help the family make plans for death, often involving the patient, who may wish to play an active role. Preplanning of the funeral relieves the family of the burden of making decisions in the intensely emotional period after a death.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, the period of mourning is an adaptive response to loss during which mourners come to accept the loss as real and permanent, acknowledge and experience the painful emotions that accompany the loss, experience life without the deceased, overcome impediments to adjustment, and find a new way of living in a world without the loved one. Particularly immediately after the death, mourners begin to recognize the reality and permanence of the loss by talking about the deceased in past terms and telling and retelling the story of the illness and death. Societal norms in the United States are frequently at odds with the normal grieving processes of people; time excused from work obligations is typically measured in days, and mourners are often expected to get over the loss quickly and get on with life.</p>
<p class="indent">In reality, the work of grief and mourning takes time, and avoiding grief work after the death often leads to long-term adjustment difficulties. According to Rando (2000), mourning for a loss involves the &#x201C;undoing&#x201D; of psychosocial ties that bind mourners to the deceased, personal adaptation to the loss, and learning to live in the world without the deceased. Six key processes of mourning allow people to accommodate to the loss in a healthy way (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1091">Rando, 2000</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Recognition of the loss</span></li>
<li><span>Reaction to the separation and experiencing and expressing the pain of the loss</span></li>
<li><span>Recollection and reexperiencing the deceased, the relationship, and the associated feelings</span></li>
<li><span>Relinquishing old attachments to the deceased</span></li>
<li><span>Readjustment to adapt to the new world without forgetting the old</span></li>
<li><span>Reinvestment</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Although many people complete the work of mourning with the informal support of families and friends, many find that talking with others who have had a similar experience, such as in formal support groups, normalizes the feelings and experiences and provides a framework for learning new skills to cope with the loss and create a new life. Hospitals, hospices, religious organizations, and other community organizations often sponsor bereavement support groups. When a person dies while enrolled in hospice, families receive proactive bereavement from the hospice agency for an average of 13 months after the death. Hospice bereavement programs vary, yet bereavement support usually starts with scheduled calls to deceased primary contact. Bereavement may then be set up as individual counseling or group sessions, such as widow or parents support groups. Hospices may offer specialized child bereavement support services. Bereavement staff may consist of specially trained nurses, child psychologists, counselors, child life specialists, and/or music or art therapists. If a person dies and is not enrolled in hospice, some palliative care teams offer bereavement or help to connect families with a hospice for bereavement resources. When one cancer center implemented a bereavement program, surveyed bereaved family members felt that acknowledgment of their loved one through a formal condolence letter had a positive impact (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Morris &#x0026; Block, 2015</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Complicated Grief and Mourning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Complicated grief and mourning are characterized by prolonged feelings of sadness and feelings of general worthlessness or hopelessness that persist long after the death, prolonged symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue) that interfere with activities of daily living, or self-destructive behaviors such as alcohol or substance abuse and suicidal ideation or attempts (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Mason &#x0026; Duffy, 2019</a>). Certain risk factors that increase the likelihood of complicated grief include death of a child or spouse, multiple losses, and history of trauma (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1178">Tofthagen, Kip, Witt, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Complicated grief and mourning require professional assessment and can be treated with psychological interventions and, in some cases, with medications.</p>
