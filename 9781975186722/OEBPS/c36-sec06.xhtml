<h5 class="h5" id="s1463">Osteoporosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Osteoporosis is the most prevalent bone disease in the world. More than 1.5 million osteoporotic fractures occur every year. Fractures requiring hospitalization have risen significantly over the past two decades (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2578">International Osteoporosis Foundation [IOF], 2017</a>). More than 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, and an additional 33.6 million have <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteopenia:&lt;/b&gt; low bone mineral density">osteopenia</button></strong> (i.e., low bone mineral density [BMD])&#x2014;the precursor to osteoporosis (IOF, 2017). The consequence of osteoporosis is bone fracture. It is projected that one of every three women and one of every five men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporosis-related fracture at some point in their lives (IOF, 2017).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1464">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Peak adult bone mass is achieved between the ages of 18 and 25 years in both women and men and is affected by genetic factors, nutrition, physical activity, medications, endocrine status, and general health (IOF, 2017). Men typically develop larger, heavier bones than women; therefore, they manifest osteoporosis at more advanced ages.</p>
<p class="indent">Primary osteoporosis occurs in women after menopause (usually by age 51) but it is not merely a consequence of aging. Failure to develop optimal peak bone mass and low vitamin D levels contribute to the development of osteopenia without associated bone loss (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Drezner, 2019</a>). Early identification of at-risk teenagers and young adults, increased calcium and vitamin D intake, participation in regular weight-bearing exercise, and modification of lifestyle (e.g., reduced use of caffeine, tobacco products, carbonated soft drinks, and alcohol) are interventions that decrease the risk of fractures and associated disability later in life (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2551">Black, Cauley, Wagman, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="#ct36-10">Chart 36-10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary osteoporosis is the result of medications or diseases that affect bone metabolism. Men are more likely than women to have secondary causes of osteoporosis, including the use of corticosteroids (especially if they receive doses in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1135" title="1135"></span>excess of 5 mg of prednisone daily for more than 3 months) and excessive alcohol intake. Specific disease states (e.g., celiac disease, hypogonadism) and medications such as anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin), thyroid replacement agents (e.g., levothyroxine), antiestrogens (e.g., medroxyprogesterone), androgen inhibitors (e.g., leuprolide), selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., fluoxetine) and proton pump inhibitors (e.g., esomeprazole) place patients at risk; these diseases and medications need to be identified and therapies instituted to halt the development of osteoporosis (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Robinson, 2020</a>). The degree of bone loss is related to the duration of medication therapy. When the drugs are discontinued or the metabolic problem is corrected, the progression is halted but restoration of lost bone mass may not occur.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1465"><img class="m" src="images/covid.jpg" alt="icon" /> <strong>COVID-19 Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">An important source of vitamin D is through direct sunlight exposure. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and IOF, in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders, have raised concerns that government initiated stay-at-home orders enacted in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have reduced the amount of time adults were spending outside, potentially limiting exposure to sunlight (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2543">American Society for Bone and Mineral Research [ASBMR], 2020</a>). Subsequently, a joint statement was published to reinforce the importance of vitamin D to bone health and highlight current recommendations for vitamin D intake; these include that adults should obtain 15 to 30 minutes of direct skin exposure to sunlight daily, and, when they cannot meet this recommendation, they should consume between 400 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily through diet or supplements (ASBMR, 2020). Research is ongoing to better understand the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 (ASBMR, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1466"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">The prevalence of osteoporosis in women older than 80 years is 50%. The average 75-year-old woman has lost 25% of her cortical bone and 40% of her trabecular bone. Most residents of long-term care facilities have a low BMD and are at risk for bone fracture. One third of all hip fractures occur among men, and men have a higher mortality rate than women after sustaining a hip fracture (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2613">Rapp, B&#x00FC;chele, Dreinh&#x0151;fer, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). It is estimated that the number of hip fractures and their associated costs will at least double by the year 2040 because of the projected aging of the U.S. population.</p>
<p class="indent">A fragility fracture is defined as one that occurs when a person falls from their natural height (or less) or with low velocity. Frequently, an underlying disease or metabolic alteration makes the bone more likely to fracture. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are the most frequently cited risks of fragility fractures. The aging of the population, the increased use of medications that contribute to falls risk, and a lack of caregivers contribute to the rising risk of fragility fractures. Inadequate staffing related to a worsening nursing shortage may result in gaps in care that increase the incidence of fragility fractures; decreased staffing may delay nursing assessments and follow-up and increase the likelihood that patients try to get up unsupervised, resulting in falls (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2552">Brent, Hommel, Maher, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Routine vertebral fracture screenings are not recommended for older adults. However, 80% to 90% of these fractures can be seen incidentally on chest x-rays taken for other purposes. It is estimated that only one third of vertebral fractures are diagnosed. Vertebral fracture risk is five times higher among patients who have had prior fractures. Furthermore, 20% of women who are postmenopausal and have a vertebral fracture will have another one within 1 year (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2605">Pouresmaeili, Kamalidehghan, Kamerehei, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Nurses are the team members who frequently are first to uncover vertebral fractures by identifying a change in a patient&#x2019;s height during routine exams conducted in office or clinic settings.</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults absorb dietary calcium less efficiently and excrete it more readily through their kidneys. Women who are postmenopausal and older adults need to consume approximately 1200 mg of daily calcium. Quantities larger than this may place patients at heightened risk of renal calculi or cardiovascular disease (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2623">United States Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2018</a>). Though bone density increases with calcium intake, the rate of fractures does not decrease in women who are postmenopausal and who routinely take calcium supplements (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2546">Bailey, Zou, Wallace, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1467">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteoporosis:&lt;/b&gt; degenerative disease of the bone characterized by reduced mass, deterioration of matrix, and diminished architectural strength">Osteoporosis</button></strong> is characterized by reduced bone mass, deterioration of bone matrix, and diminished bone architectural <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1136" title="1136"></span>strength. Normal homeostatic bone turnover is altered; the rate of bone resorption that is maintained by osteoclasts is greater than the rate of bone formation that is maintained by osteoblasts, resulting in a reduced total bone mass. The bones become progressively porous, brittle, and fragile. They fracture easily under stresses that would not break normal bone. This occurs most commonly as compression fractures (see <a href="#ff36-11">Fig. 36-11</a>) of the thoracic and lumbar spine, hip fractures, and Colles fractures of the wrist. These fractures may be the first clinical manifestation of osteoporosis (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2551">Black et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff36-11">

<p class="indent">The gradual collapse of a vertebra may be asymptomatic. With the development of kyphosis (i.e., Dowager hump), there is an associated loss of height (see <a href="#ff36-12">Fig. 36-12</a>). The postural changes result in relaxation of the abdominal muscles and a protruding abdomen. The deformity may also produce pulmonary insufficiency and increase the risk for falls related to balance issues.</p>
<p class="indent">Age-related loss begins soon after the peak bone mass is achieved (i.e., in the fourth decade). Calcitonin, which inhibits bone resorption and promotes bone formation, is decreased. Estrogen, which inhibits bone breakdown, also decreases with aging. On the other hand, parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases with aging, thus increasing bone turnover and resorption. The consequence of these changes is net loss of bone mass over time.</p>
<p class="indent">The withdrawal of estrogens at menopause or with oophorectomy causes an accelerated bone resorption within the first 5 years after cessation of menses. Most women lose 10% of their bone mass. More than half of all women older than 50 years show evidence of osteopenia (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2551">Black et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; MQIC, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1468">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Small-framed women are at greatest risk for osteoporosis. In terms of ethnicity, Asian and Caucasian women are at highest risk. Although African American women tend to have higher mineral mass when younger, they are still at risk due to the prevalence of sickle cell and autoimmune diseases in this population. In addition, many African American women also have poor calcium intake due to lactose intolerance (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2600">National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMSD], 2018</a>). The use of aromatase inhibitors is an additional risk for women with breast cancer (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Robinson, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Men have a greater peak bone mass and do not experience a sudden midlife estrogen reduction. As a result, osteoporosis occurs about one decade later, but one in four men still sustain an osteopenic fracture (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2605">Pouresmaeili et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). It is believed that both testosterone and estrogen are important in achieving and maintaining bone mass in men, although the risk profile for men is not as well established as it is for women (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2605">Pouresmaeili et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ct36-11">Chart 36-11</a>).</p>
<p class="nonindent"><img class="drop" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt="icon" /> Nutritional factors contribute to the development of osteoporosis. A diet that includes adequate calories and nutrients needed to maintain bone, calcium, and vitamin D must be consumed. Patients who have had bariatric surgery are at increased risk for osteoporosis as the duodenum is bypassed, which is the primary site for absorption of calcium. Patients who have gastrointestinal (GI) diseases that cause malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, alcoholism) may benefit from additional magnesium supplements (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2615">Rondanelli, Faliva, Gasparri, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). However, in adults who follow a strict gluten free diet, magnesium supplements are currently not recommended.</p>
<p class="indent">Autoimmune diseases also contribute to poor bone health. Many of them are associated with nutritional deficiencies (e.g., celiac, autoimmune liver disease). Furthermore, many <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1137" title="1137"></span>patients with autoimmune diseases are prescribed corticosteroid medications and, as a consequence of their disease processes, are relatively sedentary. These factors also can cause weak bones (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2545">Arase, Tsuruya, Hirose, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Bone formation is enhanced by the stress of weight and muscle activity. When immobilized by casts, general inactivity, paralysis, or other disability, the bone is resorbed faster than it is formed, and osteoporosis results (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). Immobility contributes to the development of osteoporosis. Resistance and impact exercises are most beneficial in developing and maintaining bone mass.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1469">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Osteoporosis may be undetectable on routine x-rays until there has been significant demineralization, resulting in radiolucency of the bones (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2551">Black et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). When the vertebrae collapse, causing compression fractures, the thoracic vertebrae become wedge shaped and the lumbar vertebrae become biconcave. Osteoporosis is diagnosed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which provides information about BMD at the spine and hip (see <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a>). The DEXA scan data are analyzed and reported as T-scores (the number of standard deviations above or below the average BMD value for a 30-year-old healthy adult of the same sex).</p>
<p class="indent">Baseline DEXA testing is recommended for all women older than 65 years, for women who are postmenopausal older than 50 years with osteoporosis risk factors, and for all people who have had a fracture thought to occur as a consequence of osteoporosis (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2551">Black et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). BMD studies are also useful in assessing response to therapy and are recommended 3 months post any osteoporotic fracture. There is no evidence to support basic screening of men younger than 70 years of age or to determine the optimal time interval to repeat studies in either gender following a normal baseline report (USPSTF, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Female fracture risk can be estimated using the World Health Organization (WHO) Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2554">Cass, Shepard, Asirot, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). These FRAX tables typically underestimate the bone loss risk in men. The Male Osteoporosis Risk Estimation Score (MORES) generates a more gender-specific evaluation than the standard FRAX score in men. Treatment for both genders is now reserved for those with a 10-year risk of more than 3% for hip fracture or 20% risk for other major fractures. Risk scores are based on BMD, personal and family history of fractures, BMI, gender, age, and secondary factors such as medication use, smoking, and history of rheumatoid disease. Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes are now also recognized as additional risk factors (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Robinson, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory studies (e.g., serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP], urine calcium excretion, urinary hydroxyproline excretion, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), and x-ray studies are used to exclude other possible disorders (e.g., multiple myeloma, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, malignancy) that contribute to bone loss. In men, low testosterone levels may be part of the cause.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1470">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D throughout life, with an increased calcium intake during adolescence and the middle years, protects against skeletal demineralization. Such a diet includes three glasses of skimmed vitamin D&#x2013;enriched milk or other foods high in calcium (e.g., cheese and other dairy products, steamed broccoli, canned salmon with bones) daily. A cup of milk or calcium-fortified orange juice contains about 300 mg of calcium. The recommended adequate intake level of calcium for men 50 to 70 years is 1000 mg daily, and for women aged 51 and older and men aged 71 and older is 1200 mg daily (USPSTF, 2018). Some researchers are challenging these levels as too low for patients with low baseline values, while others express concern of administering higher dosages, noting that they are associated with adverse events (e.g., renal calculi). The recommended vitamin D intake for most adults, which can be acquired from food or supplements, is between 400 and 1000 IU daily; however optimal vitamin D intake is influenced by a patient&#x2019;s age and sex (ASBMR, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Regular weight-bearing exercise promotes bone formation. Recommendations include 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic, bone-stressing exercise daily (e.g., not swimming). Weight training stimulates an increase in BMD. In addition, exercise improves balance, reducing the incidence of falls and fractures. Women who are postmenopausal and men aged 50 and older should be advised to avoid excessive intake of alcohol. Those who use tobacco products should be advised to quit. However, additional research is needed to better understand the relationship between smoking and bone health (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Strozyk, Gress, &#x0026; Brietling, 2018</a>). Current guidelines recommend that hormone therapy with estrogen not be used for primary prevention of bone loss in women who are postmenopausal (USPSTF, 2017).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure adequate calcium intake, a calcium supplement with vitamin D may be prescribed and taken with meals or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1138" title="1138"></span>with a beverage high in vitamin C to promote absorption. The recommended daily dose should be split and not taken as a single dose (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Drezner, 2019</a>). Common side effects of calcium supplements are abdominal distention and constipation. Calcium from foods is better absorbed, but calcium supplements may be necessary for patients who are lactose intolerant. Meta-analysis findings demonstrate that vitamin D taken alone is not effective in primary prevention of fractures. However, vitamin D plus calcium does reduce the risk of fractures in patients who are found to be vitamin D deficient by laboratory testing (USPSTF, 2018). Calcium and vitamin D should be taken as supplements to drugs prescribed to treat osteoporosis. These types of drugs include bisphosphonates, estrogen agonist/antagonists, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitors (see <a href="#tt36-1">Table 36-1</a>). Salmon egg based PTH is no longer a therapy, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1139" title="1139"></span>but synthetic human PTH analogues are used in patients with advanced osteoporosis or who are treatment resistant (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Robinson, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Bisphosphonate therapy is no longer recommended for patients who only have evidence of osteopenia without reaching the precise DEXA scores that define osteoporosis. These medications must be given on an empty stomach, only with water, and the person must sit upright for at least 30 minutes after ingestion. There are many gastric and esophageal risks, including gastritis, ulceration, and GI bleeding. Contradictions include previously known Barrett esophagus (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>), low serum calcium levels, and pregnancy (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Robinson, 2020</a>). Atrial fibrillation has been reported after chronic use of these medications. Two rare side effects include osteonecrosis of the jaw (more likely with intravenous [IV] preparations of these medications) and subtrochanteric fractures. Concerns about these rare adverse effects must be addressed to ensure the patient will adhere to the therapeutic plan and take the medication (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Robinson, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fracture Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fractures of the hip that occur as a consequence of osteoporosis are managed surgically by joint replacement or by closed or open reduction with internal fixation (e.g., hip pinning) as described in <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>. Management of Colles fractures is also described in <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Osteoporotic compression fractures of the vertebrae are managed conservatively. Patients with these findings should be referred to an osteoporosis specialist. Most patients who experience these fractures are asymptomatic and do not require acute care management; for those who experience pain, acute care management is indicated as outlined in the following Nursing Process section. Percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty (injection of polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA] bone cement into the fractured vertebra, followed by inflation of a pressurized balloon to restore the shape of the affected vertebra) can provide rapid relief of acute pain and improve quality of life, but might contribute to other complications resulting from alterations in spinal mechanics. These procedures are contraindicated in the presence of infection, multiple old fractures, and certain coagulopathies. The use of vertebroplasty is highly contested in the medical literature (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2560">De Leacy, Chandra, Barr, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Recognition of risks and problems associated with osteoporosis form the basis for nursing assessment. The health history focuses on family history, previous fractures, dietary consumption of calcium, exercise patterns, onset of menopause, and the use of certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids), as well as alcohol, smoking, and caffeine intake. Any symptoms the patient is experiencing, such as back pain, constipation, or altered body image, are explored.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Physical examination may disclose localized pain, kyphosis of the thoracic spine, or shortened stature. Problems in mobility and breathing may exist as a result of changes in posture and weakened muscles.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about the osteoporotic process and treatment regimen</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with fracture and muscle spasm</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for constipation associated with immobility or development of ileus (intestinal obstruction)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rLast"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for injury: additional fractures associated with osteoporosis</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include knowledge about osteoporosis and the treatment regimen, relief of pain, improved bowel elimination, and absence of additional fractures.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> U<small>NDERSTANDING OF</small> O<small>STEOPOROSIS AND THE</small> T<small>REATMENT</small> R<small>EGIMEN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patient education focuses on factors influencing the development of osteoporosis, interventions to arrest or slow the process, and measures to relieve symptoms. The nurse emphasizes that people of any age need sufficient calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise to slow the progression of osteoporosis (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Drezner, 2019</a>). Patient education related to medication therapy as described previously is important. Patients must understand that having one fracture increases the probability of sustaining another.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Relief of back pain resulting from compression fracture may be accomplished by short periods of resting in bed in a supine or side-lying position. The mattress should be supportive. Knee flexion increases comfort by relaxing back muscles. Intermittent local heat and backrubs promote muscle relaxation. The nurse instructs the patient to move the trunk as a unit and to avoid twisting. When the patient is assisted out of bed, a trunk orthosis (e.g., lumbosacral corset) may be worn for temporary support and immobilization, although such a device is frequently uncomfortable and is poorly tolerated by many older adults. The patient gradually resumes activities as pain diminishes.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> B<small>OWEL</small> E<small>LIMINATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Constipation is a problem related to immobility and medications. Early institution of a high-fiber diet, increased fluids, and the use of prescribed stool softeners help prevent or minimize constipation. If the vertebral collapse involves the T10&#x2013;L2 vertebrae, the patient may develop a paralytic ileus. The nurse therefore monitors the patient&#x2019;s intake, bowel sounds, and bowel activity.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> I<small>NJURY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Physical activity is essential to strengthen muscles, improve balance, prevent disuse atrophy, and retard progressive bone demineralization. Isometric exercises can strengthen trunk muscles. The nurse encourages walking, good body <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1140" title="1140"></span>mechanics, and good posture. Daily weight-bearing activity, preferably outdoors in the sunshine to enhance the body&#x2019;s ability to produce vitamin D, is encouraged. Sudden bending, jarring, and strenuous lifting are avoided.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <span class="yellow">Gerontologic Considerations.</span> Older adults fall frequently as a result of environmental hazards, diminished senses and cardiovascular responses, and responses to medications. The patient and family need to be included in planning for care and preventive management regimens. For example, the home environment should be assessed for elimination of potential hazards (e.g., scatter rugs, cluttered rooms and stairwells, toys on the floor, pets underfoot). A safe environment can then be created (e.g., well-lighted staircases with secure handrails, grab bars in the bathroom, properly fitting footwear). Adequate nurse&#x2013;patient ratios are also critical for fall prevention in inpatient settings (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2552">Brent et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1471">Osteomalacia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone. As a result, the skeleton softens and weakens, causing pain, tenderness to touch, bowing of the bones, and pathologic fractures. On physical examination, skeletal deformities (spinal kyphosis and bowed legs) give patients an unusual appearance and a waddling gait. These patients may be uncomfortable with their appearance and are at risk for falls and pathologic fractures, particularly of the distal radius and the proximal femur (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1472">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The major defect in osteomalacia is a deficiency of activated vitamin D, which promotes calcium absorption from the GI tract and facilitates mineralization of bone. The supply of calcium and phosphate in the extracellular fluid is low and does not move to calcification sites in bones.</p>
<p class="indent">Osteomalacia may result from failed calcium absorption or from excessive loss of calcium from the body (e.g., kidney failure). GI disorders (e.g., celiac disease, chronic biliary tract obstruction, chronic pancreatitis, small bowel resection) in which fats are inadequately absorbed are likely to produce osteomalacia through loss of vitamin D (along with other fat-soluble vitamins) and calcium, the latter being excreted in the feces with fatty acids. In addition, liver and kidney diseases can produce a lack of vitamin D because these are the organs that convert vitamin D to its active form.</p>
<p class="indent">Severe renal insufficiency results in acidosis. The body uses available calcium to combat the acidosis, and PTH stimulates the release of skeletal calcium in an attempt to reestablish a physiologic pH. During this continual drain of skeletal calcium, bony fibrosis occurs, and bony cysts form. Chronic glomerulonephritis, obstructive uropathies, and heavy metal poisoning result in a reduced serum phosphate level and demineralization of bone.</p>
<p class="indent">Hyperparathyroidism leads to skeletal decalcification and thus to osteomalacia by increasing phosphate excretion in the urine. Prolonged use of anticonvulsant medication (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital) poses a risk of osteomalacia, as does insufficient vitamin D (dietary, sunlight).</p>
<p class="indent">Osteomalacia that results from malnutrition (deficiency in vitamin D often associated with poor intake of calcium) is a result of poverty, poor dietary habits, and lack of knowledge about nutrition. It occurs most frequently in parts of the world where vitamin D is not added to food, where dietary deficiencies exist, and where sunlight is rare (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1473"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">A nutritious diet is particularly important in older adults. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is promoted. Because sunlight is necessary for synthesizing vitamin D, patients should be encouraged to spend 15 to 30 minutes each day in the sun, if not contraindicated and while avoiding sunburn (ASBMR, 2020). Prevention, identification, and management of osteomalacia in older adults are essential to reduce the incidence of fractures. When osteomalacia is combined with osteoporosis, the risk of fracture increases.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1474">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">On x-ray studies, generalized demineralization of bone is evident. Studies of the vertebrae may show a compression fracture with indistinct vertebral end plates. Laboratory studies show low serum calcium and phosphorus levels and a moderately elevated ALP. Urine excretion of calcium and creatinine is low. Bone biopsy demonstrates an increased amount of osteoid, a demineralized, cartilaginous bone matrix that is sometimes referred to as prebone.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1475">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Physical, psychological, and pharmaceutical measures are used to reduce the patient&#x2019;s discomfort and pain. If the underlying cause of osteomalacia is corrected, the disorder may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1141" title="1141"></span>resolve. If kidney disease prevents activation of absorbed vitamin D, then supplementation requires the activated form (calcitriol). If osteomalacia is caused by malabsorption, increased doses of vitamin D, along with supplemental calcium, are usually prescribed. Exposure to sunlight may be recommended; ultraviolet radiation transforms a cholesterol substance (7-dehydrocholesterol) present in the skin into vitamin D (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If osteomalacia is dietary in origin, the interventions are akin to those discussed previously in the discussion on osteoporosis. Long-term monitoring of the patient is appropriate to ensure stabilization or reversal of osteomalacia. Some persistent orthopedic deformities may need to be treated with braces or surgery (e.g., osteotomy may be performed to correct long bone deformity).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1476">Paget Disease of the Bone</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Paget disease (osteitis deformans) is a disorder of localized rapid bone turnover, most commonly affecting the skull, femur, tibia, pelvic bones, and vertebrae. The disease occurs in about 2% to 3% of the population older than 50 years. The incidence is slightly greater in aging men than in women. A family history has been noted, with siblings often developing the disease. The cause of Paget disease is not known (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2609">Ralston, Corral-Gudino, Cooper, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1477">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In Paget disease, a primary proliferation of osteoclasts occurs, which induces bone resorption. This is followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic activity that replaces the bone. As bone turnover continues, a classic mosaic (disorganized) pattern of bone develops. Because the diseased bone is highly vascularized and structurally weak, pathologic fractures occur. Structural bowing of the legs causes malalignment of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, which contributes to the development of arthritis and back and joint pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Cundy, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1478">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Paget disease is insidious. Some patients do not experience symptoms but only have skeletal deformity. The condition is most frequently identified on x-ray studies performed during a workup for another problem. Sclerotic changes and cortical thickening of the long bones occur.</p>
<p class="indent">In most patients, skeletal deformity involves the skull. The skull may thicken, and the patient may report that a hat no longer fits. In some cases, the cranium, but not the face, is enlarged. This gives the face a small, triangular appearance. Most patients with skull involvement have impaired hearing from cranial nerve compression and dysfunction. Other cranial nerves may also be similarly affected.</p>
<p class="indent">The femurs and tibiae tend to bow, producing a waddling gait. The spine is bent forward and is rigid; the chin rests on the chest. The thorax becomes immobile during respiration. The trunk is flexed on the legs to maintain balance and the arms are bent outward and forward, appearing long in relation to the shortened trunk (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Tenderness and warmth over bones may be noted due to increased bone vascularity. Patients with large, highly vascular lesions may develop high-output cardiac failure due to the increased vascular bed and metabolic demands (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). The pain is mild to moderate, deep, and aching. It increases with weight bearing. Pain and discomfort may precede skeletal deformities of Paget disease by years and are often wrongly attributed by the patient to old age or arthritis (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Cundy, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1479">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Elevated serum ALP concentration and urinary hydroxyproline excretion reflect increased osteoblastic activity. Higher values suggest more active disease. Patients with Paget disease have normal blood calcium levels. X-rays confirm the diagnosis of Paget disease by revealing local areas of demineralization and bone overgrowth in the characteristic mosaic patterns. Bone scans demonstrate the extent of the disease. Bone biopsy may aid in the differential diagnosis with other bone diseases (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Cundy, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1480">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain usually responds to NSAIDs. Gait problems from bowing of the legs are managed with walking aids, shoe lifts, and physical therapy. Weight is controlled to reduce stress on weakened bones and misaligned joints. Patients who are asymptomatic may be managed with diets adequate in calcium and vitamin D and periodic monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent">Fractures, arthritis, and hearing loss are complications of Paget disease. Fractures are managed according to location. Healing occurs if fracture reduction, immobilization, and stability are adequate. Severe degenerative arthritis may require total joint replacement; however, the afflicted &#x201C;soft&#x201D; bones do not make ideal surgical sites and are thus prone to complications. Loss of hearing is managed with hearing aids and communication techniques used with people who have hearing impairments (e.g., speech reading, body language) (see <a href="c59.xhtml">Chapter 59</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with moderate to severe disease may benefit from specific antiosteoclastic therapy. These medications reduce bone turnover, reverse the course of the disease, relieve pain, and improve mobility.</p>
<p class="indent">Bisphosphonates are the cornerstone of Paget therapy in that they stabilize the rapid bone turnover (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2609">Ralston et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Their use may not suppress all Paget symptoms, but they reduce serum ALP and urinary hydroxyproline levels. See earlier discussion on bisphosphonates.</p>
<p class="indent">Plicamycin, a cytotoxic antibiotic, may be used to control the disease. This medication is reserved for severely affected patients with neurologic compromise and for those whose disease is resistant to other therapy. This medication has dramatic effects on pain reduction and on serum calcium, ALP, and urinary hydroxyproline levels; however, there are significant side effects. It is given by IV infusion; hepatic, kidney, and bone marrow function must be monitored during therapy. Clinical remissions may continue for months after the medication is discontinued.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1481"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because Paget disease tends to affect older adults, patients and their families and caregivers should be educated about <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1142" title="1142"></span>how to compensate for altered musculoskeletal functioning with an emphasis on the risk of falls. The home environment is assessed for safety to prevent falls and to reduce the risk of fracture. Strategies for coping with a chronic health problem and its effect on quality of life need to be developed. If age-related hearing loss is exacerbated by Paget disease, alternative communication devices (e.g., text telephone, telecommunication device for the deaf) and home safety alarms may be indicated.</p>
