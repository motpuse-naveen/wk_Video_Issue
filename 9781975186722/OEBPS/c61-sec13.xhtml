<h4 class="h4a" id="s2976">HEADACHE</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Headache, or cephalalgia, is one of the most common of all human physical complaints. Headache is a symptom rather than a disease entity; it may indicate organic disease (neurologic or other disease), a stress response, vasodilation (migraine), skeletal muscle tension (tension headache), or a combination of factors. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;primary headache:&lt;/b&gt; a headache for which no specific organic cause can be found">primary headache</button></strong> is one for which no organic cause can be identified. This type of headache includes migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Cranial arteritis is another common cause of headache. A classification of headaches was issued first by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS) in 1988. The IHS revised the headache classification in 2018; an abbreviated list is shown in <a href="#ct61-7">Chart 61-7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;migraine:&lt;/b&gt; a severe, unrelenting headache often accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances">Migraine</button></strong> is a complex of symptoms characterized by periodic and recurrent attacks of severe headache lasting from hours to days in adults. The cause of migraine has not been clearly demonstrated, but it is primarily a vascular disturbance that has a strong familial tendency. The typical time of onset is at puberty, and the incidence is higher in women than men (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are many subtypes of migraine headache, including migraine with and without aura. Most patients have migraine without an aura. <em>Tension-type headaches</em> tend to be chronic and less severe and are probably the most common type of headache. <em>Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias</em> include cluster headaches and paroxysmal hemicrania. Cluster headaches are relatively uncommon and seen more frequently in men than in women (<a href="#bib4347">Norris, 2019</a>). Types of headaches not subsumed under these categories fall into the <em>other primary headache</em> group and include headaches triggered by cough, exertion, and sexual activity (IHS, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Cranial arteritis</em> is a cause of headache in the older population, reaching its greatest incidence in those older than 70 years of age. Inflammation of the cranial arteries is characterized by a severe headache localized in the region of the temporal arteries. The inflammation may be generalized (in which case cranial arteritis is part of a vascular disease) or focal (in which case only the cranial arteries are involved).</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;secondary headache:&lt;/b&gt; headache identified as a symptom of another organic disorder (e.g., brain tumor, hypertension)">secondary headache</button></strong> is a symptom associated with other causes, such as a brain tumor, an aneurysm, or lumbar puncture. Although most headaches do not indicate serious disease, persistent headaches require further investigation. Serious disorders related to headache include brain tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, severe hypertension, meningitis, and head injuries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2977">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The cerebral signs and symptoms of migraine result from a hyperexcitable brain that is susceptible to a phenomenon <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2027" title="2027"></span>known as cortical spreading depression, a wave of depolarization over the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. This depolarization activates inflammatory neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters (including serotonin), resulting in the stimulation of meningeal nociceptors. Vascular changes, inflammation, and a continuation of pain signal stimulation occur (<a href="#bib4347">Goadsby &#x0026; Holland, 2019</a>). The initial phase of this process is known as the premonitory phase and may include light, sound, and smell sensitivity. If treatment is initiated at this point, the migraine may be fully terminated. As the attack progresses, central sensitization occurs, and the migraine becomes much harder to treat.</p>
<p class="indent">Attacks can be triggered by hormonal changes associated with menstrual cycles, bright lights, stress, depression, sleep deprivation, fatigue, or odors. Certain foods containing tyramine (aged cheese, red wine, beer), monosodium glutamate, and chocolate may be food triggers (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The use of oral contraceptives may be associated with increased frequency and severity of attacks in some women.</p>
<p class="indent">Emotional or physical stress may cause contraction of the muscles in the neck and scalp, resulting in tension headache. The pathophysiology of cluster headache is not fully understood. One theory is that it is caused by dilation of orbital and nearby extracranial arteries. Cranial arteritis is thought to represent an immune vasculitis in which immune complexes are deposited within the walls of affected blood vessels, producing vascular injury and inflammation. A biopsy may be performed on the involved artery to make the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2978">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Migraine</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The migraine with aura can be divided into four phases: premonitory, aura, the headache, and recovery (headache termination and postdrome).</p>
<p class="h7">Premonitory Phase</p>
<p class="nonindent">The premonitory phase is experienced by more than 80% of adult migraine sufferers, with symptoms that occur hours to days before a migraine headache. Symptoms may include depression, irritability, feeling cold, food cravings, anorexia, change in activity level, increased urination, diarrhea, or constipation. Patients may experience the same prodrome with each migraine headache. A current theory regarding premonitory symptoms is that they involve the neurotransmitter dopamine.</p>
<p class="h7">Aura Phase</p>
<p class="nonindent">An aura may be a variable feature for patients who experience migraines and can be seen in about 30% of patients (<a href="#bib4347">Goadsby &#x0026; Holland, 2019</a>). An aura is characterized by focal neurologic symptoms. Visual disturbances (i.e., light flashes and bright spots) are most common and may be hemianopic (affecting only half of the visual field). Other symptoms that may follow include numbness and tingling of the lips, face, or hands; mild confusion; slight weakness of an extremity; drowsiness; and dizziness.</p>
<p class="indent">This period of aura was thought to correspond to the phenomenon of cortical spreading depression that is associated with reduced metabolic demand in abnormally functioning neurons. This can be associated with decreased blood flow; however, cerebral blood flow studies performed during migraine headaches demonstrate that although changes in blood vessels occur during phases of migraine, cerebral blood flow is not the main abnormality. In fact, some studies suggest that the aura and headache phases may occur simultaneously (<a href="#bib4347">Goadsby &#x0026; Holland, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Headache Phase</p>
<p class="nonindent">Migraine headache is severe and incapacitating and is often associated with photophobia (light sensitivity), phonophobia (sound sensitivity), or allodynia (abnormal perception of innocuous stimuli) (<a href="#bib4347">Goadsby &#x0026; Holland, 2019</a>). Research differs in the role of vascular changes (either vasodilatory or vasoconstrictive) with respect to migraine pathophysiology and the experience of migraine headache. Symptoms of migraine can also include nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p class="h7">Postdrome Phase</p>
<p class="nonindent">In the postdrome phase, the pain gradually subsides, but patients may experience tiredness, weakness, cognitive difficulties, and mood changes for hours to days. Muscle contraction in the neck and scalp is common, with associated muscle ache and localized tenderness. Physical exertion may exacerbate the headache pain. During this postheadache phase, patients may sleep for extended periods.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Headache Types</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The tension-type headache is characterized by a steady, constant feeling of pressure that usually begins in the forehead, temple, or back of the neck. It is often bandlike or may be described as &#x201C;a weight on top of my head.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Cluster headaches are unilateral and come in clusters of one to eight daily, with excruciating pain localized to the eye and orbit and radiating to the facial and temporal regions. The pain is accompanied by watering of the eye and nasal congestion. Each attack lasts 15 minutes to 3 hours and may have a crescendo&#x2013;decrescendo pattern (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The headache is often described as penetrating.</p>
<p class="indent">Cranial arteritis often begins with general manifestations, such as fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and fever. Clinical manifestations associated with inflammation (heat, redness, swelling, tenderness, or pain over the involved artery) usually are present. Sometimes a tender, swollen, or nodular temporal artery is visible. Visual problems are caused by ischemia of the involved structures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2979">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnostic evaluation includes a detailed history, a physical assessment of the head and neck, and a complete neurologic examination. Headaches may manifest differently in the same person over the course of a lifetime, and the same type of headache may manifest differently from patient to patient. The health history focuses on assessing the headache itself, with emphasis on the factors that precipitate or provoke it. The patient is asked to describe the headache in their own words.</p>
<p class="indent">Because headache is often the presenting symptom of a wider variety of physiologic and psychological disturbances, a general health history is an essential component of the patient database. Therefore, questions addressed in the health history should cover major medical and surgical illness as well as a body systems review.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2027</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2028" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2028">p. 2028</span></div>
<p class="indent">The medication history can provide insight into the patient&#x2019;s overall health status and indicate medications that may be provoking headaches. Antihypertensive agents, diuretic medications, anti-inflammatory agents, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are a few of the categories of medications that can provoke headaches. Daily use of over-the-counter or prescribed pain medications for 8 to 10 days out of a month can lead to a chronic headache due to medication overuse (<a href="#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Emotional factors can play a role in precipitating headaches. Stress is thought to be a major initiating factor in migraine headaches; therefore, sleep patterns, level of stress, recreational interests, appetite, emotional problems, and family stressors are relevant. There is a strong familial tendency for headache disorders, and a positive family history may help in making a diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">A direct relationship may exist between exposure to toxic substances and headache. Careful questioning may uncover chemicals to which a worker has been exposed. Under the Right-to-Know Law, employees have access to the material safety data sheets (commonly referred to as MSDSs) for all substances with which they come in contact in the workplace (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>). The occupational history also includes assessment of the workplace as a possible source of stress and for a possible ergonomic basis of muscle strain and headache.</p>
<p class="indent">A complete description of the headache itself is crucial. The nurse reviews the age at onset of headaches; this particular headache&#x2019;s frequency, location, and duration; the type of pain; factors that relieve and precipitate the event; and associated symptoms (<a href="#bib4347">Starling, 2018</a>). The data obtained should include the patient&#x2019;s own words about the headache in response to the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>What is the location? Is it unilateral or bilateral? Does it radiate?</span></li>
<li><span>What is the quality&#x2014;dull, aching, steady, boring, burning, intermittent, continuous, paroxysmal?</span></li>
<li><span>How many headaches occur during a given period of time?</span></li>
<li><span>What are the precipitating factors, if any&#x2014;environmental (e.g., sunlight, weather change), foods, exertion, other?</span></li>
<li><span>What makes the headache worse (e.g., coughing, straining)?</span></li>
<li><span>What time (day or night) does it occur?</span></li>
<li><span>How long does a typical headache last?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any associated symptoms, such as facial pain, lacrimation (excessive tearing), or scotomas (blind spots in the field of vision)?</span></li>
<li><span>What usually relieves the headache (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], ergot preparation, food, heat, rest, neck massage)?</span></li>
<li><span>Does nausea, vomiting, weakness, or numbness in the extremities accompany the headache?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the headache interfere with daily activities?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you have any allergies?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you have insomnia, poor appetite, loss of energy?</span></li>
<li><span>Is there a family history of headache?</span></li>
<li><span>What is the relationship of the headache to your lifestyle or physical or emotional stress?</span></li>
<li><span>What medications are you taking?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Diagnostic testing often is not helpful in the investigation of headache, because usually there are few objective findings. In patients who demonstrate abnormalities on the neurologic examination, CT scan, cerebral angiography, or MRI scan may be used to detect underlying causes, such as tumor or aneurysm. Electromyography (EMG) may reveal a sustained contraction of the neck, scalp, or facial muscles. Laboratory tests may include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, and thyroid hormone levels.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2980">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention begins by having the patient avoid specific triggers that are known to initiate the headache syndrome. Preventive medical management of migraine involves the daily use of one or more agents that are thought to block the physiologic events leading to an attack. Treatment regimens vary greatly, as do patient responses; therefore, close monitoring is indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Alcohol, nitrites, vasodilators, and histamines may precipitate cluster headaches. Elimination of these factors helps prevent the headaches.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2981">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Therapy for migraine headache is divided into abortive (symptomatic) and preventive approaches. The abortive approach, best used in those patients who have less frequent attacks, is aimed at relieving or limiting a headache at the onset or while it is in progress. The preventive approach is used in patients who experience more frequent attacks at regular or predictable intervals and may have a medical condition that precludes the use of abortive therapies (<a href="#bib4347">Starling, 2018</a>). Medical management of migraine during pregnancy and lactation includes nonpharmacologic strategies in addition to safe medication practices. Nonpharmacologic treatments include mainly avoidance of triggers (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>) (see <a href="#ct61-8">Chart 61-8</a>). Noninvasive neuromodulation devices may also provide some relief with minimal side effects (<a href="#bib4347">Tepper, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The triptans, which are serotonin receptor agonists, are the most specific antimigraine agents available. These agents cause vasoconstriction, reduce inflammation, and may reduce pain transmission. The triptans in routine clinical use include sumatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan (<a href="#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Many of the triptan medications are available in a variety of formulations, such as nasal sprays, inhalers, conventional tablet, disintegrating tablet, suppositories, or injections. The nasal sprays may be useful for patients experiencing nausea and vomiting (<a href="#bib4347">Tepper, 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Migraine Headaches</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>

<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize triggers of migraine headaches and how to avoid such triggers as:</p>

<p class="indent">The triptans are considered first-line treatment of the management of moderate to severe migraine pain. Best results are achieved with early use of triptans; oral dosing takes effect within 20 to 60 minutes of taking the drug and if needed may be repeated in 2 to 4 hours. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease. Careful administration and dosing instructions to patients are important to prevent adverse reactions such as increased blood pressure, drowsiness, muscle pain, sweating, and anxiety. Interactions are possible if the medication is taken in conjunction with St. John&#x2019;s wort (<a href="#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ergotamine preparations (taken orally, sublingually, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, by rectum, or by inhalation) may be effective in aborting the headache if taken early in the migraine process. They are low in cost. Ergotamine tartrate acts on smooth muscle, causing prolonged constriction of the cranial blood vessels. Each patient&#x2019;s dosage is based on individual needs. Side effects include aching muscles, paresthesias (numbness and tingling), nausea, and vomiting. Pretreatment with antiemetic agents may be required. None of the triptan medications should be taken concurrently with medications containing ergotamine because of the potential for a prolonged vasoactive reaction (<a href="#bib4347">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other nonspecific medications are also used in the treatment of migraine and include NSAIDs, antispasmodic agents, and neuroleptics. Neuroleptic agents can be used alone or in conjunction with triptans and/or NSAIDs (<a href="#bib4347">Tepper, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Prophylactic treatment of migraine includes the use of beta-blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Calcitonin gene&#x2013;related peptides (CGRPs) have been found in increased levels in patients with migraine, and three CGRP monoclonal antibodies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for migraine prevention: erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The medical management of an acute attack of cluster headaches may include 100% oxygen by facemask for 15 minutes, subcutaneous sumatriptan, or intranasal zolmitriptan (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The medical management of cranial arteritis consists of early administration of a corticosteroid to prevent the possibility of loss of vision due to vascular occlusion or rupture of the involved artery (<a href="#bib4347">Starling, 2018</a>). The patient is instructed not to stop the medication abruptly, because this can lead to relapse. Analgesic agents are prescribed for comfort.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2982">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When migraine or the other types of headaches have been diagnosed, the goal of nursing management is pain relief. It is reasonable to try nonpharmacologic interventions first, but the use of medications should not be delayed. The first priority is to treat the acute event of the headache and the second is to prevent recurrent episodes. Prevention involves patient education regarding precipitating factors, possible lifestyle or habit changes that may be helpful, and pharmacologic measures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Individualized treatment depends on the type of headache and differs for migraine, cluster headaches, cranial arteritis, and tension headache. Nursing care is directed toward treatment of the acute episode. A migraine or a cluster headache in the early phase requires abortive medication therapy instituted as soon as possible. Some headaches can be prevented if the appropriate medications are taken before the onset of pain. Nursing care during an attack includes comfort measures such as a quiet, dark environment; elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees; and symptomatic treatment (i.e., administration of antiemetic medication) (<a href="#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Symptomatic pain relief for tension headache may be obtained by application of local heat or massage. Additional strategies may include administration of analgesic agents, antidepressant medications, and muscle relaxants.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Headaches, especially migraines, are more likely to occur when the patient is ill, overly tired, or stressed. Nonpharmacologic therapies are important and include patient education about the type of headache, its mechanism (if known), and appropriate changes in lifestyle to avoid triggers. Regular sleep, meals, exercise, relaxation, and avoidance of dietary triggers may be helpful in avoiding headaches (<a href="#bib4347">Starling, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with tension headaches needs education and reassurance that the headache is not the result of a brain tumor or other intracranial disorder. Stress reduction techniques, such as biofeedback, exercise programs, and meditation, are examples of nonpharmacologic therapies that may prove helpful. The patient and family need to be educated about the importance of following the prescribed treatment regimen for headache and keeping follow-up appointments. In addition, the patient is reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screenings to promote a healthy lifestyle. <a href="#ct61-8">Chart 61-8</a> presents educational topics for the patient with migraine headaches.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
