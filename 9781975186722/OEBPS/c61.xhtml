<p class="nonindent">This chapter presents an overview of care of the patient with an altered level of consciousness (LOC); the patient with increased intracranial pressure (ICP); and the patient who is undergoing neurosurgical procedures, experiencing seizures, or experiencing headaches. Some of the disorders in this chapter, such as headaches and seizures, may be symptoms of dysfunction in another body system. Alternatively, headaches and seizures can be symptoms of a disruption of the neurologic system. These disorders can also be diagnosed at times as &#x201C;idiopathic,&#x201D; or without an identifiable cause. The commonalities of these disorders are often the behaviors and needs of the patient and the approaches nurses use to support the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The central nervous system (CNS) contains a vast network of neurons that control the body&#x2019;s vital functions. However, this system is vulnerable, and its optimal function depends on several key factors. First, the neurologic system relies on its structural integrity for support and homeostasis, but this integrity may be disrupted. Examples of structural disruption include head injury, brain tumor, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, and stroke. As brain tissue expands in the inflexible cranium, <strong>intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong> (pressure exerted by the volume of the intracranial contents within the cranial vault) rises, and cerebral perfusion is impaired. Further expansion places pressure on vital centers, which can cause permanent neurologic deficits or lead to brain death.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the neurologic system relies on the body&#x2019;s ability to maintain a homeostatic environment. It requires the delivery of the essential elements of oxygen and glucose, as well as filtration of substrates that are toxic to the neurons. The functions of the neurologic system may be decreased or absent because of the effect of toxic substrates or the body&#x2019;s inability to provide essential substrates. Sepsis, hypovolemia, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, drug and/or alcohol overdose, encephalopathy, and ketoacidosis are examples of such circumstances. Some conditions can be treated and reversed; others result in permanent neurologic deficits and disabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the specialty of neuroscience nursing requires an understanding of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurodiagnostic testing, critical-care nursing, and rehabilitation nursing, nurses in all settings care for patients with neurologic disorders (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Ongoing assessment of the patient&#x2019;s neurologic function and health needs, identification of problems, mutual goal setting, development and implementation of care plans (including education, counseling, and coordinating activities), and evaluation of the outcomes of care are nursing actions integral to the recovery of the patient. The nurse also collaborates with other members of the health care team to provide essential care, offer a variety of solutions to problems, help the patient and family gain control of their lives, and explore the educational and supportive resources available in the community. The goals are to achieve as high a level of function as possible and to enhance the quality of life for the patient with neurologic impairment and their family.</p>
