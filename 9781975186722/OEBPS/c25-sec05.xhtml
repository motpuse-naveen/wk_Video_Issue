<h4 class="h4" id="s942"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page813" title="813"></span><strong>Cardiac Arrest</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">In cardiac arrest, the heart is unable to pump and circulate blood to the body&#x2019;s organs and tissues. It is often caused by an arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation, progressive bradycardia, or asystole (i.e., absence of cardiac electrical activity and heart muscle contraction). Cardiac arrest can also occur when electrical activity is present on the ECG but cardiac contractions are ineffective, a condition called <strong>pulseless electrical activity (PEA)</strong>. PEA may be caused by a variety of problems such as profound hypovolemia (e.g., hemorrhage). Diagnoses that are commonly associated with cardiac arrest include MI, massive pulmonary emboli, hyperkalemia, hypothermia, severe hypoxia, and medication overdose. Rapid identification of these problems and prompt intervention can restore circulation in some patients.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s943">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In cardiac arrest, consciousness, pulse, and blood pressure are lost immediately. Breathing usually ceases, but ineffective respiratory gasping may occur. The pupils of the eyes begin dilating in less than a minute, and seizures may occur. Pallor and cyanosis are seen in the skin and mucous membranes. The risk of organ damage, including irreversible brain damage, and of death increases with every minute that passes. A patient&#x2019;s age and overall health determine their vulnerability to irreversible damage. As soon as possible, the diagnosis of cardiac arrest must be made and action taken immediately to restore circulation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s944"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Emergency Assessment and Management: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provides blood flow to vital organs until effective circulation can be reestablished. Following the recognition of unresponsiveness, a protocol for basic life support is initiated. The AHA Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care direct the current protocols for CPR, medical emergency teams, postcardiac arrest care, and acute respiratory compromise. The primary goal of resuscitation protocols is to save lives by preventing in-hospital cardiac arrest and optimizing outcomes (AHA, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">The resuscitation process begins with the immediate assessment of the patient for breathing and consciousness, then a call for assistance, as CPR can be performed most effectively with the addition of more health care providers and equipment (e.g., defibrillator). The current resuscitation protocol recommends the following practices for CPR:</p>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span><em>Quick recognition of sudden cardiac arrest</em>. The patient is assessed for responsiveness and breathing.</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span><em>Activation of the Emergency Response System</em>. Within a medical facility, a call is made to alert the emergency response team. Outside of a medical facility, 911 is called to activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS).</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">3.</span><em>Performance of high-quality CPR</em>. If there is no carotid pulse detected, chest compressions are initiated at a rate of 100 bpm.</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">4.</span><em>Rapid cardiac rhythm analysis and defibrillation</em> within 2 minutes for patients in ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, followed by continuous chest compressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Rescue breathing is no longer recommended unless health care providers are present; if that is the case, it is then started after chest compressions. The airway is opened using a head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver, and any obvious material in the mouth or throat is removed. An oropharyngeal airway may be inserted if available to help maintain patency of the airway. Rescue ventilations are provided using a bag-valve mask or mouth-mask device. Oxygen is given at 100% during resuscitation to correct hypoxemia and improve tissue oxygenation.</p>
<p class="indent">Compressions are performed with the patient on a firm surface such as the floor or a cardiac board. The provider, facing the patient&#x2019;s side, places one hand in the center of the chest on the lower half of the sternum and positions the other hand on top of the first hand (Fig. 25-5). The chest is compressed 2 inches (approximately 5 cm) at a rate of 100 compressions/min. Complete recoil of the chest must be allowed between compressions to allow for cardiac filling. Interruptions in CPR to switch providers or check for a pulse are minimized (<a href="#bib1891">Panchal, Berg, Hirsch, et al., 2019</a>). It is recommended providers switch every 2 minutes due to the exertion of delivering effective compressions.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Defibrillation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As soon as a monitor/defibrillator is available, monitor electrodes are applied to the patient&#x2019;s chest and the heart rhythm is analyzed. When an automated external defibrillator (AED) is used, the device is turned on, the pads are applied to the patient&#x2019;s chest, and the rhythm is analyzed by the defibrillator to determine whether a shock is indicated. When the ECG shows ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, immediate defibrillation is the treatment of choice.</p>
<p class="indent">The AHA (2017) recommends the first defibrillation to occur within 2 minutes of the first documented, pulseless rhythm. Survival time decreases for every minute that defibrillation is delayed. Following defibrillation, high-quality chest compressions are resumed immediately. Survival after cardiac arrest has been improved by extensive education of health care providers and by the use of AEDs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support</h6>
<p class="nonindent">During a resuscitation, an advanced airway (e.g., endotracheal tube, tracheal tube) may be placed by a primary provider, nurse anesthetist, or respiratory therapist to ensure a patent airway and adequate ventilation. Following confirmation of the placement of airway (auscultation of breath sounds, observation of equal chest expansion, or a carbon dioxide detector), positive-pressure ventilation should be delivered without pausing chest compressions at a rate of one breath every 6 seconds, or 10 breaths/min (<a href="#bib1883">Kleinman, Goldberger, Rea, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib1903">Panchal et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Specific subsequent advanced support interventions depend on the assessment of the patient&#x2019;s condition and response to therapy. For example, if asystole is detected on the monitor, CPR is continued while IV or intraosseous (IO) epinephrine is given. Additional medications (<a href="#tt25-4">Table 25-4</a>) may be indicated for the patient during and after resuscitation.</p>
<p class="indent">Each person on an effective Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) team, called a <em>CPR team</em> or sometimes a <em>code team,</em> has delineated roles. An efficient code team is characterized by individual members who are knowledgeable about their position and responsibilities. This ensures direct and clear lines of communication, effective team work, and a safe environment for the health care team and the patient (<a href="#bib1903">Panchal et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is recommended practice to support family members of all patients who have had cardiac arrest and are undergoing resuscitation. In addition, there is clear support to have them present at the bedside if that is consonant with the patient&#x2019;s wishes. Written policies and procedures to support family presence during this time ought to be readily available for nurses and staff to easily access. Studies demonstrate family presence does not disrupt patient care, has no negative outcomes during the resuscitation event, and results in no adverse psychological effects (<a href="#bib1861">American Association of Critical-Care Nurses [AACN], 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">CPR is stopped when vital signs are detected or the patient responds. If the patient does not respond to interventions, the resuscitation effort may be stopped by the code team leader or other provider in charge of the resuscitation after options have been exhausted. Many factors are considered in the decision, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page815" title="815"></span>such as the initiating arrhythmia, potential etiology, length of time for initiation of life support, the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment, and the patient&#x2019;s overall clinical status.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Follow-Up Monitoring and Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The care provided to the patient following resuscitation is another determinant of survival (AHA, 2017). A 12-lead ECG is performed to detect any new ST segment elevation or myocardial ischemia (see Chapter 23). Continuous ECG monitoring and frequent blood pressure assessments are essential until hemodynamic stability is established and blood pressure is kept in a range to support adequate perfusion. Factors that precipitated the arrest such as arrhythmias or electrolyte or metabolic imbalances are identified and treated.</p>
<p class="indent">Following resuscitation and the return of spontaneous circulation, patients who are comatose may benefit from targeted temperature management (TTM). With TTM, core body temperature is decreased to 32&#x00B0; and 36&#x00B0;C (89.6&#x00B0; to 96.8&#x00B0;F) for at least 24 hours. This induced hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate and need for oxygen. Similarly, hyperthermic conditions, such as fever, are avoided to reduce oxygen demands (<a href="#bib1868">Callaway, Donnino, Fink, et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Advances in cardiac care, such as new techniques for effective resuscitation and postresuscitation hypothermia, have improved outcomes for patients. Research studies demonstrate better neurologic recovery and overall survival for patients when the correct algorithms and team dynamics are used after cardiac arrest; there is hope for even better outcomes in the future.</p>
