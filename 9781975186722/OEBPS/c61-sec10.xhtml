<h4 class="h4a" id="s2962">SEIZURE DISORDERS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Seizures are episodes of abnormal motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic activity (or a combination of these) that result from sudden excessive discharge from cerebral neurons (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A localized area or all of the brain may be involved. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has defined <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;epilepsy:&lt;/b&gt; at least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart">epilepsy</button></strong> as more than one unprovoked seizure (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4313">Fisher, Cross, French, et al., 2017</a>). The ILAE differentiates between three main seizure types: focal onset, generalized onset, and unknown onset seizures (see <a href="#ct61-4">Chart 61-4</a>). Focal (or partial) seizures are thought to originate within a localized area of the brain. Generalized seizures occur in and rapidly engage bilaterally distributed networks. Unknown onset seizures can be described as &#x201C;unclassified,&#x201D; so termed because of incomplete data surrounding the event, but they may also be described from their clinical features (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Fisher et al., 2017</a>). Seizures may also be characterized as &#x201C;provoked,&#x201D; or related to acute, reversible conditions such as structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, or unknown etiologies.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2963">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The underlying cause is an electrical disturbance (arrhythmia) in the nerve cells in one section of the brain; these cells emit abnormal, recurring, uncontrolled electrical discharges. The characteristic seizure is a manifestation of this excessive neuronal discharge. Associated loss of consciousness, excess movement or loss of muscle tone or movement, and disturbances of behavior, mood, sensation, and perception may also occur.</p>

<p class="indent">The specific causes of seizures are varied and can be categorized as genetic, due to a structural or metabolic condition, or the cause may be yet unknown etiologies (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Fisher et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Causes of seizures include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Allergies</span></li>
<li><span>Brain tumor</span></li>
<li><span>Cerebrovascular disease</span></li>
<li><span>CNS infections</span></li>
<li><span>Drug and alcohol withdrawal</span></li>
<li><span>Fever (childhood)</span></li>
<li><span>Head injury</span></li>
<li><span>Hypertension</span></li>
<li><span>Hypoxemia of any cause, including vascular insufficiency</span></li>
<li><span>Metabolic and toxic conditions (e.g., kidney injury, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, pesticide exposure)</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2964">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Depending on the location of the discharging neurons, seizures may range from a simple staring episode (generalized absence seizure) to prolonged convulsive movements with loss of consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial pattern of the seizures indicates the region of the brain in which the seizure originates (see <a href="#ct61-4">Chart 61-4</a>). Only a finger or hand may shake, or the mouth may jerk uncontrollably. The person may talk unintelligibly; may be dizzy; and may experience unusual or unpleasant sights, sounds, odors, or tastes, but without loss of consciousness (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Generalized seizures often involve both hemispheres of the brain, causing both sides of the body to react. Intense rigidity of the entire body may occur, followed by alternating muscle relaxation and contraction (generalized tonic&#x2013;clonic contraction). The simultaneous contractions of the diaphragm and chest muscles may produce a characteristic epileptic cry. The tongue is often chewed, and the patient can be incontinent of urine and feces. After 1 or 2 minutes, the convulsive movements begin to subside; the patient relaxes and lies in deep coma, breathing noisily. The respirations at this point are chiefly abdominal. In the postictal state (after the seizure), the patient is often confused and hard to arouse and may sleep for hours. Many patients report headache, sore muscles, fatigue, and depression (AANN, 2016a). Other generalized seizures may be absence types of seizures (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Focal seizures are subdivided into events characterized by both motor and nonmotor symptoms. There may be an impairment of consciousness or awareness or other dyscognitive features, localization, and progression of symptoms (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Fisher et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2965">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnostic assessment is aimed at determining the type of seizures, their frequency and severity, and the factors that precipitate them. A developmental history is taken, including events of pregnancy and childbirth, to seek evidence of preexisting injury. The patient is also questioned about illnesses or head injuries that may have affected the brain. In addition to physical and neurologic evaluations, diagnostic examinations <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2020" title="2020"></span>include biochemical, hematologic, and serologic studies. MRI is used to detect structural lesions such as focal abnormalities, cerebrovascular abnormalities, and cerebral degenerative changes (AANN, 2016a).</p>
<p class="indent">The EEG furnishes diagnostic evidence for a substantial proportion of patients with epilepsy and assists in classifying the type of seizure. Abnormalities in the EEG usually continue between seizures or, if not apparent, may be elicited by hyperventilation or during sleep (AANN, 2016a). Microelectrodes (depth electrodes) can be inserted deep in the brain to probe the action of single brain cells. Some people with clinical seizures have normal EEGs, whereas others who have never had seizures have abnormal EEGs. Telemetry and computerized equipment are used to monitor electrical brain activity while the patient pursues their normal activities and to store the readings on computer tapes for analysis. Video recording of seizures taken simultaneously with EEG telemetry is useful in determining the type of seizure as well as its duration and magnitude (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">SPECT is an additional tool that is sometimes used in the diagnostic workup. It is useful for identifying the epileptogenic zone so that the area in the brain giving rise to seizures can be removed surgically (AANN, 2016a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2966">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">During a Seizure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A major responsibility of the nurse is to observe and record the sequence of signs. The nature of the seizure usually indicates the type of treatment required (AANN, 2016a). Before and during a seizure, the patient is assessed and the following items are documented:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Circumstances before the seizure (visual, auditory, or olfactory stimuli; tactile stimuli; emotional or psychological disturbances; sleep; hyperventilation)</span></li>
<li><span>Occurrence of an aura (a premonitory or warning sensation, which can be visual, auditory, or olfactory)</span></li>
<li><span>First thing the patient does in the seizure&#x2014;where the movements or the stiffness begins, conjugate gaze position, and the position of the head at the beginning of the seizure. This information gives clues to the location of the seizure origin in the brain. (In recording, it is important to state whether the beginning of the seizure was observed.)</span></li>
<li><span>Type of movements in the part of the body involved</span></li>
<li><span>Areas of the body involved (turn back bedding to expose patient)</span></li>
<li><span>Size of both pupils and whether the eyes are open</span></li>
<li><span>Whether the eyes or head are turned to one side</span></li>
<li><span>Presence or absence of automatisms (involuntary motor activity, such as lip smacking or repeated swallowing)</span></li>
<li><span>Incontinence of urine or stool</span></li>
<li><span>Duration of each phase of the seizure</span></li>
<li><span>Unconsciousness, if present, and its duration</span></li>
<li><span>Any obvious paralysis or weakness of arms or legs after the seizure</span></li>
<li><span>Inability to speak after the seizure</span></li>
<li><span>Movements at the end of the seizure</span></li>
<li><span>Whether or not the patient sleeps afterward</span></li>
<li><span>Cognitive status (confused or not confused) after the seizure</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">In addition to providing data about the seizure, nursing care is directed at preventing injury and supporting the patient, not only physically but also psychologically. Consequences such as anxiety, embarrassment, fatigue, and depression can be devastating to the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">After a Seizure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After a patient has a seizure, the nurse&#x2019;s role is to document the events leading to and occurring during and after the seizure and to prevent complications (e.g., aspiration, injury). The patient is at risk for hypoxia, vomiting, and pulmonary aspiration. To prevent complications, the patient is placed in the side-lying position to facilitate drainage of oral secretions, and suctioning is performed, if needed, to maintain a patent airway and prevent aspiration (see <a href="c61-sec11.xhtml#ct61-5">Chart 61-5</a>). Seizure precautions are maintained, including having available functioning suction equipment with a suction catheter. The bed is placed in a low position with two to three side rails up and padded, if necessary, to prevent injury to the patient. The floor may be padded as an additional safety measure. The patient may be drowsy and may wish to sleep after the seizure; they may not remember events leading up to the seizure and for a short time thereafter.</p>
