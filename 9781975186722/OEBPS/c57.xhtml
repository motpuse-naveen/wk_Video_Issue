<p class="nonindent">Burn injuries can be painful, costly, and disfiguring; they may require intensive and extensive rehabilitation therapy and are often associated with long-term disability. An extensive burn injury is associated with a complex, multisystem pathophysiology that continues to challenge health systems, despite advances that have resulted in significantly reduced comorbidities and length of stay (LOS). These advances in treatment of patients with severe burns include critical-care management, fluid resuscitation, nutrition, surgical d&#x00E9;bridement, wound coverage, and antimicrobial therapies (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4128">Jones, Williams, Cairns, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4146">Weissman, Wagman, Givon, et al., 2017</a>). The role of the nurse in the interdisciplinary treatment team includes provision of holistic evidence-based care during all phases of burn injury recovery to optimize patient outcomes.</p>
