<h4 class="h4" id="s4">Health</h4>
<p class="nonindent">How health is perceived depends on how health is defined. The World Health Organization (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib23">WHO, 2006</a>) defines <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health:&lt;/b&gt; according to the World Health Organization (2006), a &#x201C;state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity&#x201D; (p. 1)">health</button></strong> in the preamble to its constitution as a &#x201C;state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity&#x201D; (p. 1). This definition implies that health and illness are not polar opposites. Theoretically, therefore, it is possible for a patient to have a physical illness and yet strive for and perhaps attain health in another domain (e.g., mental, social). Although commonly cited worldwide, this definition has been criticized for being too utopian&#x2014;after all, it is not possible for anyone to achieve <em>complete</em> physical, mental, and social well-being (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Murdaugh, Parsons, &#x0026; Pender, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s5">Wellness</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;wellness:&lt;/b&gt; the ability to perform well, adjust and adapt to varying situations, and report feeling well and harmoniousa">Wellness</button></strong> has been defined as being equivalent to health. Wellness involves being proactive and being involved in self-care activities aimed toward a state of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. Wellness is conceptualized as having four components: (1) the capacity to perform to the best of one&#x2019;s ability, (2) the ability to adjust and adapt to varying situations, (3) a reported feeling of well-being, and (4) a feeling that &#x201C;everything is together&#x201D; and harmonious (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Hood, 2018</a>). With this in mind, nurses must aim to promote positive changes that are directed toward health and well-being. The sense of wellness has a subjective aspect that addresses the importance of recognizing and responding to patient individuality and diversity in health care and nursing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s6">Health Promotion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Today, increasing emphasis is placed on health, wellness, health promotion, and self-care. Health is seen as resulting from a lifestyle oriented toward wellness. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health promotion:&lt;/b&gt; focuses on the potential for wellness and targets appropriate alterations in personal habits, lifestyle, and environment in ways that reduce risks and enhance health and well-being">Health promotion</button></strong> focuses on the potential for wellness and targets appropriate alterations in personal habits, lifestyle, and environment in ways that reduce risks and enhance health and well-being (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">People are increasingly knowledgeable about health and take more interest in and responsibility for health and well-being. Organized self-care wellness education programs emphasize health promotion, disease prevention, management of illness, self-care, and collaborative use of the professional health care system. Web sites, chat groups, open forums, and social media support groups promote sharing of experiences and information about self-care with others who have similar conditions, chronic diseases, or disabling conditions. The advent of mobile wireless computer technologies (e.g., Fitbit&#x2122;) and novel informatics tools (e.g., Carb Manager) have had the effect of tailoring health promotion activities to meet individual preferences (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Murdaugh et al., 2019</a>). Researchers have begun to take advantage of these popular technologic advancements by developing population-based registries. The use of mobile health apps has demonstrated a positive impact on health-related behaviors, specifically, physical activity, dietary management, adherence to medication or therapy, and knowledge related to medications and diagnostic testing. Moreover, most mobile health apps seem to promote better clinical health outcomes (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Han &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). According to the WHO (2019), &#x201C;primary health care ensures people receive comprehensive care&#x2014;ranging from promotion and prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care&#x2014;as close as feasible to people&#x2019;s everyday environment&#x201D; (p. 1). Primary health care includes a lifelong commitment to meeting individuals&#x2019; health needs across the lifespan; empowerment of individuals to assume accountability for their own health care; and attention to societal needs for health care through social policy and action.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s7">Health Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Health care describes services that are offered to individuals, families, and communities to help them maintain health and wellness, prevent and manage illness and complications, and provide support through rehabilitation, recovery, and transitions to palliative care. Health care can be provided in inpatient, outpatient, and community settings by a variety of health professionals, including but not limited to nurses, primary providers, pharmacists, dieticians, social workers, psychologists, and physical, occupational, speech and respiratory therapists.</p>
