<p class="nonindent">Dyspareunia (difficult or painful penile-vaginal intercourse) can be superficial, deep, primary, or secondary and may occur at the beginning of, during, or after penile-vaginal intercourse. Dyspareunia may be related to many factors, including injury during childbirth; lack of vaginal lubrication; a history of incest, sexual abuse, or assault; endometriosis; pelvic or vaginal infection; vaginal dryness due to breast-feeding or menopause; gastrointestinal disorders; fibroids; urinary tract infection; STIs; or vulvodynia (vulvar pain that affects women of all ages without any discernible physical cause). Depending on the cause of dyspareunia, counseling, extra lubrication, or antidepressant medications may be prescribed (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3656">Mayo Clinic, 2018</a>). Women&#x2019;s health issues related to sexuality may be affected by many factors. Thus, these issues need to be taken seriously, carefully assessed, and treated.</p>
