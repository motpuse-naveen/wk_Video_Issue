<h4 class="h4" id="s1349">Diffuse Connective Tissue Diseases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Diffuse connective tissue disease refers to a group of systemic disorders that are chronic in nature and are characterized by diffuse inflammation and degeneration in the connective tissues. These disorders share similar clinical features and may affect some of the same organs. The characteristic clinical course is one of exacerbations and remissions. Although diffuse connective tissue diseases have unknown causes, they are thought to be the result of immunologic abnormalities. They include RA, SLE, Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and giant cell arteritis (GCA).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1350">Rheumatoid Arthritis</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rheumatoid arthritis:&lt;/b&gt; a systemic autoimmune disease with symmetric arthritic manifestations and multiple extra-articular features">Rheumatoid arthritis</button></strong> is an autoimmune disease of unknown origin that affects 1% to 2% of the population worldwide, with females having a three times greater incidence than males. It may occur at any age but the onset commonly occurs between the third and sixth decade of life. The incidence of RA increases after the sixth decade of life (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). RA that occurs after the age of 65 is referred to as elderly onset RA (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Additional risks that have been identified include family history, environmental influences such as diet or geographic location, nulliparity, as well as the modifiable factors of smoking and obesity (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Mogul, Corsi, &#x0026; McAuliffe, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1351">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The exact mechanism of action for the etiology of RA is unknown. Evidence points to a genetic predisposition and the development of immunologically mediated joint inflammation (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Eliopoulos, 2021</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). An autoimmune reaction (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ff34-1">Fig. 34-1</a>) occurs in the synovial tissue. RA synovium breaks down collagen, causing edema, proliferation of the synovial membrane, and ultimately pannus formation. Pannus destroys cartilage and erodes the bone. The consequence is the loss of articular surfaces and joint motion. Muscle fibers undergo degenerative changes. Tendon and ligament elasticity and contractile power are lost.</p>
<p class="indent">The RA inflammatory process has also been implicated in other disease processes (i.e., arteriosclerosis). It is hypothesized that the RA disease process somehow interferes with the production of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is the form of cholesterol responsible for decreasing cellular lipids and, therefore, is considered antiatherosclerotic.</p>
<p class="indent">The nervous system is also affected by the RA inflammatory process. The synovial inflammation can compress the adjacent nerve, causing neuropathies and paresthesias. Axonal degeneration and neuronal demyelination are also possible due to the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells, causing necrotizing or occlusive vasculitis (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1352">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism have collaborated and established criteria for classifying RA. These criteria are based on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1079" title="1079"></span>a point system where a total score of 6 or greater is required for the diagnosis of RA. The scoring system is based on joint involvement (number of joints affected), serology (low positive or high positive rheumatoid factor [RF] or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA]), abnormal results of the acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]), and duration of symptoms greater than 6 weeks. Patients diagnosed with RA who are excluded from these diagnostic criteria include: (1) patients who have one joint with synovitis that is not related to any other clinical disease and who also score at least 6 to 10 points on the scale, and (2) patients diagnosed with bony erosions on x-ray (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2470">Aletaha, Neogi, Silman, et&#x00A0;al., 2010</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2495">Molano-Gonzalez, Olivares-Matinez, Anaya, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The initial clinical manifestations of RA include symmetric joint pain and morning joint stiffness lasting longer than 1 hour. Over the course of the disease, clinical manifestations of RA vary, usually reflecting the stage and severity of the disease. Symmetric joint pain, swelling, warmth, erythema, and lack of function are classic symptoms. Palpation of the joints reveals spongy or boggy tissue. Often, fluid can be aspirated from the inflamed joint. Characteristically, the pattern of joint involvement begins in the small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2500">Omma et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). As the disease progresses, the knees, shoulders, hips, elbows, ankles, cervical spine, and temporomandibular joints may be affected. The onset of symptoms is usually acute. Symptoms are usually bilateral and symmetric.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early stages of disease, even before the presentation of bony changes, limitation in function can occur when there is active inflammation in the joints. Joints that are hot, swollen, and painful are not easily moved. The patient tends to guard or protect these joints by immobilizing them. Immobilization for extended periods can lead to contractures, creating soft tissue deformity.</p>
<p class="indent">Deformities of the hands (e.g., ulnar deviation and swan neck deformity) and feet are common in RA (see <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a>, <a href="c35-sec02.xhtml#ff35-6">Fig. 35-6</a>). The deformity may be caused by misalignment resulting from swelling, progressive joint destruction, or the subluxation (partial dislocation) that occurs when one bone slips over another and eliminates the joint space. Deformities of RA differ from those seen with osteoarthritis (OA), such as Heberden&#x2019;s and Bouchard&#x2019;s nodes (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">RA is a systemic disease with multiple extra-articular features. Most common are fever, weight loss, fatigue, anemia, lymph node enlargement, and Raynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon (cold- and stress-induced vasospasm causing episodes of digital blanching or cyanosis). Rheumatoid nodules are common in patients with more advanced RA. These nodules are usually nontender and movable in the subcutaneous tissue. They usually appear over bony prominences such as the elbow, are varied in size, and can disappear spontaneously or progress to ulceration (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2019</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Young, 2019</a>). Nodules occur only in people who have rheumatoid factor. Other extra-articular features include arteritis, neuropathy, pericarditis, splenomegaly, and Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome (dry eyes and dry mucous membranes).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1353">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several assessment findings are associated with RA: rheumatoid nodules, joint inflammation detected on palpation, and certain laboratory findings. The history and physical examination focus on manifestations, such as bilateral and symmetric stiffness, tenderness, swelling, and temperature changes in the joints (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2019</a>). The patient is also assessed for extra-articular changes; these often include weight loss, sensory changes, lymph node enlargement, and fatigue. Symptoms and examination findings are often recorded using a disease activity score, a variety of which are in use, to evaluate disease activity, help guide treatment decisions, and monitor treatment efficacy (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2490">Mahmood, van Tuyl, Schoonmade, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Rheumatoid factor is present in many patients with RA, but its presence alone is not diagnostic of RA, and its absence does not rule out the diagnosis. Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) have a specificity of approximately 95% at detecting RA (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). The ESR and CRP tend to be significantly elevated in the acute phases of RA and are therefore useful in monitoring active disease and disease progression. The complete blood count (CBC) should be assessed to establish a baseline count especially prior to starting medications (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Patients may exhibit anemia, and platelets may be elevated due to the inflammatory process. A tuberculin (TB) skin test should be done prior to the initiation of certain medications to rule out tuberculosis. In the event the patient has latent TB and has never been treated, the infection can be reactivated. The patient should also be assessed for hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which could impact treatment strategies if positive. If the client tests positive for hepatitis, the infection should be treated prior to starting medication. Liver and kidney monitoring are recommended for most DMARD therapy because it can cause elevation of the liver enzymes and can also affect kidney function.</p>
<p class="indent">X-ray, ultrasound, or both of the hands, wrists, and feet can be useful in establishing a baseline for joint evaluation, and assessing the joints for erosions and synovitis. Joint damage may occur within the first 6 to 12 months of diagnosis and should be followed as indicated. Plain x-ray is the most common radiographic study used to track disease progression as it is inexpensive, reliable, and reproducible (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2490">Mahmood et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). MRI can also be useful to detect small erosions that may not be visible on x-ray or ultrasound.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1354">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment at all phases of the RA disease process is to decrease joint pain and swelling, achieve clinical remission, decrease the likelihood of joint deformity, and minimize disability. Initial treatment delays have been implicated in greater long-term joint deformity. Aggressive and early treatment regimens are warranted. The use of a targeted pharmacologic treatment strategy is recommended to decrease RA disease activity (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Once the diagnosis of RA is made, treatment should begin with either a nonbiologic or biologic DMARD. The goal of using DMARD therapy is preventing inflammation and joint damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Recommended treatment guidelines include beginning with the nonbiologic DMARDs (methotrexate is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1080" title="1080"></span>preferred agent but leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine are also used) biologics, or tofacitinibic within 3 months of disease onset. Care should be used with each of these medications by performing routine blood testing for liver and kidney function, along with monitoring the CBC for anemia. Dosage may need to be modified for patients with renal impairment (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another treatment approach for RA is the use of biologic DMARDs. These agents have been specifically engineered to target the most prominent proinflammatory mediators in RA&#x2014;TNF-&#x03B1;, B cells, T cells, IL-1, and IL-6 (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#tt34-2">Table 34-2</a>). Biologic DMARDs are the first targeted therapy for RA. Clinical evidence suggests that biologic DMARDs work more quickly and show a greater delay in radiologic disease progression when compared to nonbiologic DMARDs. The biologic DMARDs are more expensive and have fewer years of usage with the RA population. Therefore, they tend to be reserved for patients with persistent moderate to severe RA who have not responded adequately to synthetic DMARDs (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">After initiating treatment with a DMARD, patients generally report a beneficial effect within 6 weeks and tolerate the medication relatively well. However, some patients may take longer to see improvement. Corticosteroids are recommended as a &#x201C;bridge&#x201D; in the early treatment but are not recommended for long-term therapy due to side effects (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A newer class of drugs, the Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, bind to the active JAK enzyme sites, inhibiting autophosphorylation and thus inhibiting cytokine production and decreasing the immune response (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2494">Mogul et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). JAK inhibitors are used in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiologic DMARDs. They may also be used as monotherapy (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2494">Mogul et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">NSAIDs and specifically the cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme blockers are used for pain and inflammation relief. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are commonly prescribed because of their low cost and analgesic properties. They must be used with caution, however, in long-term chronic diseases because of the possibility of gastric ulcers. Several COX-2 enzyme blockers have been approved for treatment of RA. Cyclo-oxygenase is an enzyme that is involved in the inflammatory process. COX-2 medications block the enzyme involved in inflammation (COX-2) while leaving intact the enzyme involved in protecting the stomach lining (COX-1). As a result, COX-2 enzyme blockers are less likely to cause gastric irritation and ulceration than other NSAIDs; however, they are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and must be used with caution (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The nurse should be aware that NSAIDs do not prevent erosions or alter disease progression and, consequently, are medications useful only for symptom relief (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Additional analgesia may be prescribed for periods of extreme pain. Opioid analgesic agents are avoided because of the potential for continuing need for pain relief. Nonpharmacologic pain management techniques (e.g., relaxation techniques, heat and cold applications) are taught.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Established Rheumatoid Arthritis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In patients with established RA, a formal program with occupational and physical therapy is prescribed to educate the patient about principles of pacing activities, work simplification, range of motion, and muscle-strengthening exercises. The patient is encouraged to participate actively in the management program. The medication program is reevaluated periodically, and appropriate changes are made if disease progression is occurring despite pharmacologic treatment. Additional agents may be added to enhance the disease-modifying effect of methotrexate. Combination therapy using one nonbiologic DMARD and one biologic DMARD is common (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For more established RA, reconstructive surgery and corticosteroids are often used. Reconstructive surgery is indicated when pain cannot be relieved by conservative measures and the threat of loss of independence is eminent. Surgical procedures include synovectomy (excision of the synovial membrane), tenorrhaphy (suturing of a tendon), arthrodesis (surgical fusion of the joint), surgical repair, and replacement of the joint. Surgery is not performed during exacerbations.</p>
<p class="indent">Systemic corticosteroids are used when the patient has unremitting inflammation and pain or needs a &#x201C;bridging&#x201D; medication while waiting for the slower DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate) to begin taking effect. Low-dose corticosteroid therapy is prescribed for the shortest time necessary to minimize side effects (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2503">Singh et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Single large joints that are severely inflamed and fail to respond promptly to the measures outlined previously may be treated by local injection of a corticosteroid.</p>
<p class="indent">Topical analgesic agents such as capsaicin and methylsalicylate are often prescribed. Topical diclofenac sodium gel may help with joint pain in the hands and knees (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For most patients with RA, the emotional and possible financial burden of the disease can lead to depressive symptoms and sleep deprivation. The patient may require the short-term use of low-dose antidepressant medications, such as amitriptyline, paroxetine, or sertraline, to reestablish an adequate sleep pattern and manage depressive symptoms. Patients may benefit from referrals for talk therapy or group support.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Obesity Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the general population and in patients with RA. One large study reported that the prevalence of obesity, diagnosed with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, was approximately 20% at diagnosis and increased each year (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2498">Nikiphorou, Norton, Young, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Furthermore, the presence of obesity adversely affected disease progression, function, and quality of life in patients with RA followed for 10 to 25 years (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2498">Nikiphorou et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Management of obesity in the patient with RA is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain medications (i.e., oral corticosteroids) used in RA treatment stimulate the appetite and, when combined with decreased activity, may lead to weight gain. In fact, one study reported that approximately half the increase in BMI within the first year of diagnosis with RA could be attributed to steroid use (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2498">Nikiphorou et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A dietician can counsel the patient about better food choices. Food selection should include the five major groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and protein), with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1081" title="1081"></span>emphasis on foods high in vitamins, protein, and iron for tissue building and repair. Patients who are overweight or have obesity need to be counseled about eating a healthy, calorie-restricted diet.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1355">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of the patient with RA follows the basic plan of care presented earlier (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a>). The most common issues for the patient with RA include pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, altered mood, and limited mobility. The patient with newly diagnosed RA needs information about the disease to make daily self-management decisions and cope with having a chronic disease. Consultation with a dietician for assessment and assistance with appropriate food choices may be helpful.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients commonly have comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease that can lead to complications. It has been estimated that the primary cause of death for up to 40% of patients diagnosed with RA is cardiovascular disease. The cause of cardiovascular disease in these patients is thought to be due to elevated lipid values, chronic inflammation, dysfunction of the endothelium, and/or abnormal homocysteine levels (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Medications used for treating RA may cause serious and adverse effects. The primary provider bases the prescribed medication regimen on clinical findings and past medical history, and then, with the help of the nurse, monitors for side effects using periodic clinical assessments and laboratory testing. The nurse, who can be available for consultation between visits with the primary provider, works to help the patient recognize and deal with these side effects (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#tt34-2">Table 34-2</a>). Medication may need to be stopped or the dose reduced. If the patient experiences an increase in symptoms while the complication is being resolved or a new medication is being initiated, the nurse&#x2019;s counseling regarding symptom management may relieve potential anxiety and distress.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education is an essential aspect in nursing care of the patient with RA to enable the patient to maintain as much independence as possible, to take medications accurately and safely, and to use adaptive devices correctly (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2499">Oh et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Patient education focuses on self-management related to the disorder, the therapeutic regimen prescribed to treat it, and the potential side effects of medications. Patients undergoing surgery need education as well. The nurse works with the patient and family on strategies to maintain independence, function, and safety in the home (see <a href="#ct34-4">Chart 34-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient and family are encouraged to verbalize their concerns and ask questions. Because RA commonly affects young women, major concerns may be related to the effects of the disease on childbearing potential, caring for family, or work responsibilities. The patient with a chronic illness may seek a &#x201C;cure&#x201D; or have questions about alternative therapies. Research indicates that acupuncture is safe and may be beneficial for patients with RA (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Chou &#x0026; Chu, 2018</a>). There is not enough evidence of the effectiveness of other complementary, alternative, and integrative health therapies, and more rigorous research is needed (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Chou &#x0026; Chu, 2018</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2486">Katz-Talmor, Katz, Porta-Katz, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates patients using topical analgesic agents to apply sparingly, avoid areas of open skin, and avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Patients should also wash their hands carefully after application and assess for local skin irritation. Pain, fatigue, and depressive symptoms can interfere with the patient&#x2019;s ability to learn and should be addressed before the education is initiated. Various educational strategies may then be used, depending on the patient&#x2019;s previous knowledge base, interest level, degree of comfort, social or cultural influences, and readiness to learn. The nurse educates the patient about basic disease management and necessary adaptations in lifestyle. Some types of aerobic exercise and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1082" title="1082"></span>strength training should be discussed (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2485">Kapale et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Because suppression of inflammation and autoimmune responses require the use of anti-inflammatory, disease-modifying antirheumatic, and immunosuppressive agents, the patient is taught about prescribed medications, including type, dosage, rationale, potential side effects, self-administration, and required monitoring procedures. If hospitalized, the patient is encouraged to practice new self-management skills with support from caregivers and significant others. The nurse then reinforces disease management skills during each patient contact. Barriers are assessed, and measures are taken to promote adherence to medications and the treatment program.</p>

<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Depending on the severity of the disease and the patient&#x2019;s resources and supports, referral for home care may be warranted. For example, the patient who is an older adult or frail, has RA that limits function significantly, and lives alone may need referral for home care.</p>
<p class="indent">The impact of RA on everyday life is not always evident when the patient is seen in the hospital or in an ambulatory care setting. The increased frequency with which nurses see patients in the home provides opportunities for recognizing problems and implementing interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of patients with RA.</p>
<p class="indent">During home visits, the nurse has the opportunity to assess the home environment and its adequacy for patient safety and management of the disorder. Adherence to the treatment program can be more easily monitored in the home setting, where physical and social barriers to adherence are more readily identified. For example, a patient who also has diabetes and requires insulin may be unable to fill the syringe accurately or unable to administer the insulin because of impaired joint mobility. Appropriate adaptive equipment needed for increased independence is often identified more readily when the nurse sees how the patient functions in the home. Any barriers to adherence are identified, and appropriate referrals are made.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients at risk for impaired skin integrity, the home health nurse can closely monitor skin status and also educate, provide, or supervise the patient and family in preventive skin care measures. The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s need for assistance in the home and supervises home health aides, who may meet many of the needs of the patient with RA. Referrals to physical and occupational therapists may be made as problems are identified and limitations increase. A home health nurse may visit the home to make sure that the patient can function as independently as possible despite mobility problems and can safely manage treatments, including pharmacotherapy. The patient and family should be informed about support services such as Meals on Wheels and local Arthritis Foundation chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">Because many of the medications used to suppress inflammation are injectable, the nurse may administer the medication to the patient or educate about self-injection. These frequent contacts allow the nurse to reinforce other disease management techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status, adequacy of symptom management, and adherence to the management plan. Patients should know which type of rheumatic disease they have, not just that they have &#x201C;arthritis&#x201D; or &#x201C;arthritis of the knee.&#x201D; The importance of attending follow-up appointments is emphasized to the patient and family, and they should be reminded about the importance of participating in other health promotion activities and health screening.</p>

<p class="nonindent">SLE is an inflammatory, autoimmune disorder that affects nearly every organ in the body. The overall incidence of SLE is estimated to be 1.8 to 7.6 per 100,000 people (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2475">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018</a>). It occurs 4 to 12 times more frequently in women than in men and occurs more often in African Americans, Hispanics/Latino Americans, Asians, and American Indians/Alaska Natives than among White Americans (CDC, 2018). In addition to SLE, other forms of adult lupus exist, including subacute cutaneous or discoid lupus erythematous, and drug-induced lupus (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2471">Aringer, Costenbader, Daikh, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1357">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">While the exact cause is not known, SLE starts with the body&#x2019;s immune system inaccurately recognizing one or more components of the cell&#x2019;s nucleus as foreign, seeing it as an antigen. The immune system starts to develop antibodies to the nuclear antigen. In particular, B cells begin to overproduce antibodies with the help of multiple cytokines such as B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), which is overexpressed in SLE. The antibodies and antigens form antigen&#x2013;antibody complexes and have the propensity to get trapped in the capillaries of visceral structures. The antibodies also act to destroy host cells. It is thought that those two mechanisms are responsible for the majority of the clinical manifestations of this disease process. The immunoregulatory disturbance is thought to be brought about by some combination of four distinct factors: genetic, immunologic, hormonal, and environmental (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Research into the genetic origins of SLE has thus far revealed that multiple genes are likely implicated in the development of SLE (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). The large majority of SLE cases, however, remain sporadic and unrelated to family medical history.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the high number of women with SLE compared with men, it is hypothesized that female sex hormones (estrogen) play a role in the predisposition to SLE. Estrogen may contribute to the body&#x2019;s response of overreacting to the body&#x2019;s own tissues.</p>
<p class="indent">Although genetics and hormones likely play a role in the predisposition of SLE, it is hypothesized that exogenous or environmental triggers are also implicated in the onset of the disease process. These triggers may include cigarette smoke, ultraviolet rays, exposure from sunlight and fluorescent light bulbs, medications (hydralazine, minocyline, or procainamide), viral infections, emotional stress, stress on the body (e.g., surgery, pregnancy), and silica dust exposure in the occupational setting (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1358">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SLE is an autoimmune, systemic disease that can affect any body system (<a href="#ff34-2">Fig. 34-2</a>). The disease process involves chronic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1083" title="1083"></span>states where symptoms are minimal or absent and acute flares where symptoms and lab results are elevated. Symptoms most often include fever, fatigue, skin rashes, as well as joint pain and swelling (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2471">Aringer et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; CDC, 2018). The mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, renal, nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems are most commonly involved. Less commonly affected are the gastrointestinal tract and liver as well as the ocular system.</p>

<p class="indent">Some type of cutaneous system manifestation is experienced in up to 85% of patients with SLE (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Several skin manifestations may occur in patients with SLE, including subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which involves papulosquamous or annular polycyclic lesions, and a discoid rash, which is a chronic rash with erythematous papules or plaques and scaling and can cause scarring and pigmentation changes (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2471">Aringer et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). In some cases, the only skin involvement may be a discoid rash. In some patients with SLE, the initial skin involvement is the precursor to more systemic involvement. The lesions often worsen during <strong>exacerbations</strong> (flares) of the systemic disease and possibly are provoked by sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Oral ulcers, which may accompany skin lesions, may involve the buccal mucosa or the hard palate, occur in crops, and are often associated with exacerbations. Other cutaneous manifestations include splinter hemorrhages, alopecia, and Raynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon.</p>
<p class="indent">Joint pain and swelling occur in more than 90% of patients with SLE (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Joint swelling, tenderness, and pain on movement are also common. Frequently, these are accompanied by morning stiffness.</p>
<p class="indent">The cardiac system is also commonly affected in SLE. Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Patients may present with substernal chest pain that is aggravated by movement or inspiration. Symptoms can be acute and severe or last for weeks at a time. Other cardiac symptoms may involve myocarditis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and valvular incompetence.</p>
<p class="indent">Nephritis as a result of SLE, also referred to as lupus nephritis, occurs due to a buildup of antibodies and immune complexes that cause damage to the nephrons. Serum creatinine levels and urinalysis are used in screening for renal involvement. Early detection allows for prompt treatment so that renal damage can be prevented. Renal involvement may lead to hypertension, which also requires careful monitoring and management (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Central nervous system involvement is widespread, encompassing the entire range of neurologic disease. The varied and frequent neuropsychiatric presentations of SLE are now widely recognized and include psychosis, cognitive impairment, seizures, peripheral and cranial neuropathies, transverse myelitis, and strokes. These are generally demonstrated by subtle changes in behavior patterns or cognitive ability.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1359">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis of SLE is based on a complete history, physical examination, and blood tests. In addition to the general assessment performed for any patient with a rheumatic disease, assessment for known or suspected SLE has special features. The skin is inspected for erythematous rashes. Cutaneous erythematous plaques with an adherent scale may be observed on the scalp, face, or neck. Areas of hyperpigmentation or depigmentation may be noted, depending on the phase and type of disease. The patient should be questioned about skin changes (because these may be transitory) and specifically about sensitivity to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light. The scalp should be inspected for alopecia and the mouth and throat for ulcerations reflecting gastrointestinal involvement.</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiovascular assessment includes auscultation for pericardial friction rub, possibly associated with myocarditis and accompanying pleural effusions. The pleural effusions and infiltrations, which reflect respiratory insufficiency, are demonstrated by abnormal lung sounds. Papular, erythematous, and purpuric lesions developing on the fingertips, elbows, toes, and extensor surfaces of the forearms or lateral sides of the hand that may become necrotic suggest vascular involvement.</p>
<p class="indent">Joint swelling, tenderness, warmth, pain on movement, stiffness, and edema may be detected on physical examination. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1084" title="1084"></span>The joint involvement is often symmetric and similar to that found in RA.</p>
<p class="indent">The neurologic assessment is directed at identifying and describing any central nervous system changes. The patient and family members are asked about any behavioral changes, including manifestations of neurosis or psychosis. Signs of depression are noted, as are reports of seizures, chorea, or other central nervous system manifestations.</p>
<p class="indent">The antinuclear antibody (ANA) is positive in more than 95% of patients with SLE, indicating exceptional specificity (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2471">Aringer et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Other laboratory tests include anti-DNA (antibody that develops against the patient&#x2019;s own DNA), anti-ds DNA (antibody against DNA that is highly specific to SLE, which helps differentiate it from drug-induced lupus), and anti-Sm (antibody against Sm, which is a specific protein found in the nucleus). Other blood work includes the CBC, which may reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1360">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SLE can be life-threatening, but advances in its treatment have led to improved survival and reduced morbidity. Acute disease requires interventions directed at controlling increased disease activity or exacerbations that can involve any organ system. Disease activity is a composite of clinical and laboratory features that reflect active inflammation secondary to SLE. Management of the more chronic condition involves periodic monitoring and recognition of meaningful clinical changes requiring adjustments in therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The goals of treatment include preventing progressive loss of organ function, reducing the likelihood of acute disease, minimizing disease-related disability, and preventing complications from therapy. Management of SLE involves regular monitoring to assess disease activity and therapeutic effectiveness.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The mainstay of SLE treatment is based on pain management and nonspecific immunosuppression. Therapy includes monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, antimalarial agents, NSAIDs, and immunosuppressive agents. Each of these medications has potentially serious side effects, including organ damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes and binds to BLyS. BLyS acts to stimulate B cells to produce antibodies against the body&#x2019;s own nuclei, which is an integral part of the disease process in SLE. Belimumab acts to render BLyS inactive, preventing it from binding to B-cell surfaces and stimulating B-cell activity. This action then halts the production of unnecessary antibodies and decreases disease activity in SLE. Live vaccines are contraindicated for 30 days before taking this medication (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Rituximaub is an additional monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of SLE for its immune modulating effects (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2489">MacIsaac, Siddiqui, Jamula, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroids are another medication used topically for cutaneous manifestations, in low oral doses for minor disease activity, and in high doses for major disease activity. Intravenous (IV) administration of corticosteroids is an alternative to traditional high-dose oral administration. One of the most important risk factors associated with the use of corticosteroids in SLE is osteoporosis and fractures (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An antimalarial medication, hydroxychloroquine, is effective for managing cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and mild systemic features of SLE (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). The NSAIDs used for minor clinical manifestations are often used in conjunction with corticosteroids in an effort to minimize corticosteroid requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">Immunosuppressive agents (alkylating agents and purine analogues) are used because of their effect on overall immune function. These medications are generally reserved for patients who have serious forms of SLE that have not responded to conservative therapies. Examples include cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, and methotrexate, which are contraindicated in pregnancy and have been used most frequently in SLE nephritis (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1361">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of the patient with SLE is based on the fundamental plan presented earlier in the chapter (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a>). The most common nursing diagnoses include fatigue, impaired skin integrity, body image disturbance, and lack of knowledge for self-management decisions. The disease or its treatment may produce dramatic changes in appearance and considerable distress for the patient. The changes and the unpredictable course of SLE necessitate expert assessment skills and nursing care with sensitivity to the psychological reactions of the patient. The patient may benefit from participation in support groups, which can provide disease information, daily management tips, and social support. Because sun and ultraviolet light exposure can increase disease activity or cause an exacerbation, patients should be instructed to avoid exposure or to protect themselves with sunscreen and appropriate clothing.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the increased risk of involvement of multiple organ systems, patients should understand the need for routine periodic screenings as well as health promotion activities. A dietary consultation may be indicated to ensure that the patient is knowledgeable about dietary recommendations, given the increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis.</p>
<p class="indent">In the healthy population, smoking and using electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars clearly poses health risks. Smoking increases the incidence of respiratory infections, lung cancer, risk of coronary artery disease; increases blood pressure, which can worsen kidney function; inhibits liver function (which can also inhibit treatment medications from working appropriately, such as hydroxychloroquine); increases the risk for skin diseases; and increases the risk for osteoporosis. The health risks of ENDS use is under investigation. Patients diagnosed with SLE are at even higher risk of developing lung cancer and other rare cancers. Therefore, smoking cessation programs should be offered to all patients who report smoking habits (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2496">Montes, Mocarzel, Lanzieri, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient about the importance of continuing prescribed medications and addresses the changes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1085" title="1085"></span>and potential side effects that are likely to occur with their use. The patient is reminded of the importance of monitoring because of the increased risk of systemic involvement, including renal and cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the immunosuppression associated with systemic corticosteroid usage, the nurse must watch for signs and symptoms of infection, especially with patients who are acutely ill.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should also screen the patient for osteoporosis, because long-term use of corticosteroids increases the incidence of osteoporosis. Patients should have a bone mineral density test performed at diagnosis and prior to beginning steroid use to determine a baseline status and then every 2 years thereafter. Educating the patient regarding calcium and vitamin D supplementation daily is encouraged, along with the benefits of weight-bearing activities to support bone health.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1362">Primary Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s Syndrome</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome is a rare systemic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects middle-aged women (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2478">Cornec, Devauchelle-Pensec, Mariette, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome often manifests in conjunction with other autoimmune diseases, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease, RA, and SLE (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2489">MacIsaac et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2495">Molano-Gonzalez et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1363">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s is a multisystem disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration leading to failure of the lacrimal and salivary glands (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2479">Cui, Li, Yin, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1364">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common symptoms involve kerotoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes), xerostomia (dry mouth), pain, and fatigue (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2478">Cornec et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2479">Cui et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Some patients will complain that their eyes feel &#x201C;gritty,&#x201D; as if there is sand present. The patient&#x2019;s eyes will exhibit increased redness and lack of tearing. The mouth will have dry and sticky mucous membranes. The reduced saliva production may lead to difficulty swallowing.</p>
<p class="indent">Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome can also exhibit symptoms in many other organ systems. Lesions may ulcerate and can be painful. Optic neuritis, trigeminal neuralgia, and sensory neuropathy may be present, with symptoms such as burning pain in the extremities, numbness, vertigo, arthralgia, and/or myalgia. Raynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon, which involves blood vessel spasms leading to decreased circulation to the toes, fingers, nose, and ears, may be reported. Patients experience symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2479">Cui et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Sleep disturbances are frequently reported and may be related to pain, fatigue, and depressive symptoms (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2481">Hackett, Gotts, Ellis, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1365">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The classification criteria for diagnosis of Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome identify six distinct indices (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel, Stone, Crofford, et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Ocular symptoms such as chronic dry eye (Kerotoconjunctivitis Sicca).</span></li>
<li><span>Positive ocular tests (evaluating tear production, corneal, and conjunctival damage). Ocular testing may include Schemer tear test or Rose Bengal tests.</span></li>
<li><span>Oral symptoms, dry mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Histopathology evaluation (of salivary glands). This will help differentiate the cause of dry mouth from other causes, such as infection, malignancy, stones, and sarcoidosis.</span></li>
<li><span>Salivary gland involvement.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Laboratory tests include autoantibodies to ribonucleoprotein particles (Ro[SS-A] and/or La[SS-B]), which act as antigens in this disease process. Other laboratory indices are also useful in diagnosing Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome. Rheumatoid factor is present in 50% to 70% of patients. ANA, circulating DNA (cDNA), anti-CCP, ACPA, and anticentromere antibody (ACA) are all potentially present in Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome and in some cases may act as markers for disease activity (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2495">Molano-Gonzalez et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For vasculitis manifestations, a skin biopsy can yield useful information such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis found on histologic examination. If neurologic symptoms are present, nerve conduction studies, MRI, electroencephalograms, and cerebrospinal fluid testing may be used to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1366">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is no cure for Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome, and treatment is aimed at symptom management and improving quality of life (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2478">Cornec et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2479">Cui et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2481">Hackett et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Artificial tears, drops such as pilocarpine, and ocular ointments such as topical cyclosporine are used for dry eyes. Tears normally drain through the lacrimal puncta to the nose, which can render artificial tears ineffective. Therefore, punctum plugs may be a useful management tool. One systematic review reported that pilocarpine is highly effective in decreasing symptoms of dry mouth by increasing salivary flow (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2482">Hamad, Lodi, Porter, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Biotene oral rinse may also be useful for some patients. Additional suggestions include eating small frequent meals; omitting spicy, salty, and irritating food; and avoiding smoking (including ENDS), excessive alcohol use, and drugs with anticholinergic side effects. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of rituximab and interferone (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2478">Cornec et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2482">Hamad et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2489">MacIsaac et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Patients need to be screened for depression and sleep disturbances, then appropriate referrals made when these comorbid conditions are present (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2479">Cui et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2481">Hackett et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1367">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care is based on the fundamental plan of nursing care presented earlier (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a>). The primary issues for the patient with Sj&#x00F6;gren&#x2019;s syndrome are pain, fatigue, and inadequate knowledge of self-management techniques. The nurse is in the unique position to educate and reinforce the treatment regimen with the patient, especially involving the ocular treatments to avoid eye infections secondary to the dry eyes. The high prevalence of pain, fatigue, and depressive symptoms may interfere with the patient&#x2019;s ability to learn and engage in self-management techniques and should be addressed (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2479">Cui et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1085</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1086" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1086">p. 1086</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1368">Scleroderma</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune disease affecting the connective tissue of the skin, blood vessel walls, and internal organs. There are two general types: localized (affecting only the cutaneous system) or diffuse (routinely referred to as systemic sclerosis and affecting multiple organ systems). Similar to other autoimmune diseases, women are affected four times more than men, and the onset occurs typically between the ages of 25 and 50 years (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Scleroderma has a variable course with remissions and exacerbations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1369">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathogenesis is poorly understood. Scleroderma commonly begins with skin involvement. Mononuclear cells cluster on the skin and stimulate lymphokines to stimulate procollagen. Insoluble collagen is formed and accumulates excessively in the tissues (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). Initially, the inflammatory response causes edema, with a resulting taut, smooth, and shiny skin appearance. The skin then undergoes fibrotic changes, leading to loss of elasticity and movement. Eventually, the tissue degenerates and becomes nonfunctional. This chain of events, from inflammation to degeneration, also occurs in blood vessels, major organs, and body systems (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1370">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The skin and subcutaneous tissues become increasingly hard and rigid due to excess collagen and cannot be pinched up from the underlying structures. Wrinkles and lines are obliterated. The skin is dry because sweat secretion over the involved region is suppressed. The extremities stiffen and lose mobility. The condition spreads slowly; for years, these changes may remain localized in the hands and the feet. The face appears masklike, immobile, and expressionless, and the mouth becomes rigid; referred to as &#x201C;stone facies&#x201D; (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The changes within the body, although not visible directly, are vastly more important than the visible changes. The esophagus hardens, interfering with swallowing. The lungs become scarred, impeding respiration. Digestive disturbances occur because of sclerosing (hardening) of the intestinal mucosa. Vascular involvement of the kidneys leads to malignant hypertension and renal insufficiency. Cardiac disorders include pericarditis, heart block, and myocardial fibrosis (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may manifest a variety of symptoms referred to as the CREST syndrome. <em>CREST</em> stands for <em>c</em>alcinosis (calcium deposits in the tissues), <em>R</em>aynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon, <em>e</em>sophageal dysmobility, <em>s</em>clerodactyly (scleroderma of the digits), and <em>t</em>elangiectasia (capillary dilation that forms a vascular lesion) (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1371">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment focuses on the sclerotic changes in the skin, contractures in the fingers, and color changes or lesions in the fingertips. Assessment of systemic involvement requires a systems review with special attention to gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, and cardiac symptoms. Limitations in mobility and self-care activities should be assessed, along with the impact the disease has had (or will have) on body image.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no one conclusive diagnostic test used to diagnose scleroderma. Generally, the patient is diagnosed with the CREST type of scleroderma if they have four of the five symptoms in the syndrome (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1372">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of scleroderma is mainly symptomatic and supportive. No medication regimen is effective in modifying the disease process in scleroderma, but various medications are used to treat organ system involvement. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors when there is kidney involvement has led to a substantial decrease in mortality from hypertensive kidney disease (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">All patients require counseling, during which realistic individual goals may be determined. Support measures include strategies to decrease pain and limit disability. A moderate exercise program is encouraged to prevent joint contractures. Patients are advised to avoid extreme temperatures and to use lotion to minimize skin dryness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1373">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of the patient with scleroderma is based on the fundamental plan of nursing care presented earlier (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a>). The primary nursing diagnoses are impaired skin integrity; self care deficits; impaired nutritional status; and disturbed body image. The patient with advanced disease may also have impaired gas exchange, impaired cardiac output, impaired swallowing, and constipation.</p>
<p class="indent">Providing meticulous skin care and preventing the effects of Raynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon are major nursing challenges. See <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion of Raynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1374">Polymyositis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Polymyositis is a group of diseases that are termed <em>idiopathic inflammatory myopathies</em> (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>). They are rare chronic conditions, with an incidence estimated at 2 cases per 10,000 adults per year. Polymyositis is most commonly seen in women versus men (2:1) and usually seen between 40 and 50 years of age (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Miller &#x0026; Vleugels, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1375">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Polymyositis is classified as autoimmune because autoantibodies are present. However, these antibodies do not cause damage to muscle cells, indicating only an indirect role in tissue damage. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, including cellular and humoral immune mechanisms (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1376">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The onset may be very slow and insidious, with symptoms gradually worsening over weeks to months. Proximal muscle weakness is typically the first symptom. Muscle weakness is usually symmetric and diffuse. Common complaints include having difficulty rising from a chair, climbing steps, or holding <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1087" title="1087"></span>up the head. Myalgia and muscle tenderness occur in 25% to 50% of patients. Dermatomyositis, a related condition, is most commonly identified by an erythematous smooth or scaly lesion found over the joint surface, which often occurs prior to symptoms of weakness in 50% to 60% of patients (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Miller &#x0026; Vleugels, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1377">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A complete history and physical examination help exclude other muscle-related disorders. As with other diffuse connective tissue disorders, no single test confirms polymyositis. An electromyogram is performed to rule out degenerative muscle disease. A muscle biopsy may reveal inflammatory infiltrate in the tissue. Serum studies indicate increased muscle enzyme activity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1378">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of medical management (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). IV immune globulin, plasmapheresis, lymphapheresis, and total-body irradiation have been used if there is no response to corticosteroids. The goal is to control inflammation and prevent long-term damage to muscles, joints, and internal organs (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Norris, 2019</a>). The antimalarial agent hydroxychloroquine may be effective for skin rashes. Physical therapy is initiated slowly, with range-of-motion exercises to maintain joint mobility, followed by gradual strengthening exercises (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1379">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care is based on the fundamental plan of nursing care presented earlier (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a>). The primary nursing diagnoses for the patient with polymyositis are impaired mobility, fatigue, self care deficit, and lack of knowledge of self-management techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with polymyositis may have symptoms similar to those of other inflammatory diseases. However, proximal muscle weakness is characteristic, making activities such as combing the hair, reaching overhead, and using stairs difficult. Therefore, the use of assistive devices may be recommended, and referral to occupational or physical therapy may be warranted.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1380">Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Giant Cell Arteritis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">PMR involves stiffness of muscles and pain in the neck, shoulder, and pelvic girdle. GCA is a form of vasculitis affecting the medium-sized and large arteries of the body (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>). GCA is also sometimes referred to as temporal arteritis (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2483">Hill, Black, Nossent, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). PMR and GCA represent a spectrum of one disease. Both primarily affect individuals older than 50 years and are associated with the same HLA haplotype genetic markers. PMR and GCA occur predominately in Caucasians and often in first-degree relatives. PMR has an annual incidence rate of 52 cases per 100,000 people older than 50 years. GCA varies by geographic location and has the highest incidence in Scandinavian countries. PMR is two to three times more common than GCA (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1381">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The underlying mechanism of action involved with PMR and GCA is unknown. It is clear, however, that the immune system is abnormally activated in both disease processes with increases in circulating monocytes that produce IL-1 and IL-6. These circulating monocytes make the endothelial linings of blood vessels more vulnerable to vasculitis (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>). Immunoglobulin deposits in the walls of inflamed temporal arteries suggest that an autoimmune process is at work.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1382">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">PMR is characterized by severe proximal muscle discomfort with mild joint swelling. Severe aching in the neck, shoulder, and pelvic muscles is common. Stiffness is noticeable most often in the morning and after periods of inactivity. This stiffness can become so severe that patients struggle putting on a coat or combing their hair. Systemic features include low-grade fever, weight loss, malaise, anorexia, and depression. Because PMR usually occurs in people 50 years and older, it may be confused with, or dismissed as, an inevitable consequence of aging.</p>
<p class="indent">GCA may cause headaches, changes in vision, and jaw claudication. These symptoms should be evaluated immediately because of the potential for blindness and stroke if left untreated (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2483">Hill et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). PMR and GCA have a self-limited course, lasting several months to several years (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2466">Klippel et&#x00A0;al., 2008</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1383">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment focuses on musculoskeletal tenderness, weakness, and decreased function. Careful attention should be directed toward assessing the head (for changes in vision, headaches, and jaw claudication). An MRI scan may be used in the assessment of extra-articular synovitis in patients with PMR, regardless of symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Often, diagnosis is difficult because of the lack of specificity of tests. A markedly high ESR is a screening test but is not definitive. The CRP level and platelet count also provide valuable data. In fact, simultaneous elevation in the ESR and CRP has a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 75.7% in making the diagnosis of GCA when coupled with clinical findings (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Seetharaman, 2019</a>). Diagnosis of both GCA and PMR is more likely to be made by eliminating other potential diagnoses. The dramatic and immediate response to treatment with corticosteroids is considered by some to be diagnostic.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of GCA, biopsy of the temporal artery is the definitive diagnostic tool (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2513">Seetharaman, 2019</a>). High-resolution MRI is an alternative or adjunct to the traditional temporal artery biopsy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1384">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment for patients with PMR (without GCA) is moderate doses of corticosteroids. Longer durations of corticosteroid treatment are required with patients who have higher baseline inflammatory markers. Gradual tapering of the corticosteroid treatment should be monitored. NSAIDs are sometimes given in mild disease. The treatment for patients with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1088" title="1088"></span>GCA is rapid initiation of and strict adherence to a regimen of corticosteroids. This is essential to avoid the complication of blindness (<a href="c34-sec06.xhtml#bib2483">Hill et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Aspirin is an adjunctive treatment may help reduce the risk of visual loss.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1385">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of the patient with PMR is based on the fundamental plan of nursing care presented earlier (see <a href="c34-sec01.xhtml#ct34-3">Chart 34-3</a>). The most common nursing diagnoses are pain and lack of knowledge of medications.</p>
<p class="indent">A management concern is that the patient will take the prescribed medication, frequently corticosteroids, until symptoms improve and then discontinue the medication. The decision to discontinue the medication should be based on clinical and laboratory findings and the prescription. Nursing implications are related to helping the patient prevent and monitor adverse effects of medications (e.g., infections, diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, and depression) and adjust to those side effects that cannot be prevented (e.g., increased appetite and altered body image).</p>
