<p class="nonindent">HHS is a metabolic disorder most often of type 2 diabetes resulting from a relative insulin deficiency initiated by an illness that raises the demand for insulin. This is a serious condition in which hyperosmolality and hyperglycemia predominate, with alterations of the sensorium (sense of awareness). At the same time, ketosis is usually minimal or absent. The basic biochemical defect is the lack of effective insulin (i.e., insulin resistance). Persistent hyperglycemia causes osmotic diuresis, which results in losses of water and electrolytes. To maintain osmotic equilibrium, water shifts from the intracellular fluid space to the extracellular fluid space. With glycosuria and dehydration, hypernatremia and increased osmolarity occur. <a href="#tt46-6">Table 46-6</a> compares DKA and HHS.</p>
<p class="indent">HHS occurs most often in older adults (50 to 70 years of age) who have no known history of diabetes or who have type 2 diabetes (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>). HHS often can be traced to an infection or a precipitating event such as an acute illness (e.g., stroke), medications that exacerbate hyperglycemia (e.g., thiazides), or treatments such as dialysis. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1517" title="1517"></span>The history includes days to weeks of polyuria with adequate fluid intake. What distinguishes HHS from DKA is that ketosis and acidosis generally do not occur in HHS, partly because of differences in insulin levels. In DKA, no insulin is present, and this promotes the breakdown of stored glucose, protein, and fat, which leads to the production of ketone bodies and ketoacidosis. In HHS, the insulin level is too low to prevent hyperglycemia (and subsequent osmotic diuresis), but it is high enough to prevent fat breakdown. Patients with HHS do not have the ketosis-related gastrointestinal symptoms that lead them to seek medical attention. Instead, they may tolerate polyuria and polydipsia until neurologic changes or an underlying illness (or family members or others) prompts them to seek treatment.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2044">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical picture of HHS is one of hypotension, profound dehydration (dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor), tachycardia, and variable neurologic signs (e.g., alteration of consciousness, seizures, hemiparesis) (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Down, 2018</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="#tt46-6">Table 46-6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2045">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnostic assessment includes a range of laboratory tests, including blood glucose, electrolytes, BUN, complete blood count, serum osmolality, and arterial blood gas analysis. The blood glucose level is greater than 600 mg/dL, the osmolality exceeds 320 mOsm/kg, and ketoacidosis is absent (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>). Electrolyte and BUN levels are consistent with the clinical picture of severe dehydration (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>). Mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, and hallucinations are common secondary to the cerebral dehydration that results from extreme hyperosmolality. Orthostatic hypotension accompanies the dehydration (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2046">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The overall approach to the treatment of HHS is similar to that of DKA: fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and insulin administration. Because patients with HHS are typically older, close monitoring of volume and electrolyte status is important for prevention of fluid overload, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. Fluid treatment is started with 0.9% or 0.45% NS, depending on the patient&#x2019;s sodium level and the severity of volume depletion. Central venous or hemodynamic pressure monitoring guides fluid replacement. Potassium is added to IV fluids when urinary output is adequate and is guided by continuous ECG monitoring and frequent laboratory determinations of potassium (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Extremely elevated blood glucose concentrations decrease as the patient is rehydrated. Insulin plays a less important role in the treatment of HHS because it is not needed for reversal of acidosis, as in DKA. Nevertheless, insulin is usually given at a continuous low rate to treat hyperglycemia, and replacement IV fluids with dextrose are given (as in DKA) after the glucose level has decreased to the range of 250 to 300 mg/dL (13.8 to 16.6 mmol/L) (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other therapeutic modalities are determined by the underlying illness and the results of continuing clinical and laboratory evaluation. It may take 3 to 5 days for neurologic symptoms to clear, and treatment of HHS usually continues well after metabolic abnormalities have resolved. After recovery from HHS, many patients can control their diabetes with MNT alone or with MNT and oral antidiabetic medications. Insulin may not be needed once the acute hyperglycemic complication is resolved. Frequent SBGM is important in prevention of recurrence of HHS (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">For the patient with DKA, the nurse monitors the ECG for arrhythmias indicating abnormal potassium levels. Vital signs (especially blood pressure and pulse), arterial blood gases, breath sounds, and mental status are assessed every hour and recorded on a flow sheet. Neurologic status checks are included as part of the hourly assessment because cerebral edema can be a severe and sometimes fatal outcome. Blood glucose levels are checked every hour (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For the patient with HHS, the nurse assesses vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory values. Fluid status and urine output are closely monitored because of the high risk of kidney failure secondary to severe dehydration. Because HHS tends to occur in older patients, the physiologic changes that occur with aging should be considered. Careful assessment of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and kidney function throughout the acute and recovery phases of HHS is important (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph30"><strong><small>NURSING DIAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for hypovolemia associated with polyuria and dehydration</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Fluid imbalance associated with fluid loss or shifts</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and heart failure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hypokalemia</p>

<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cerebral edema</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, increased knowledge about diabetes basic skills and self-care, decreased anxiety, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1518" title="1518"></span><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph30"><strong><small>MAINTAINING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Intake and output are measured. IV fluids and electrolytes are given as prescribed, and oral fluid intake is encouraged when it is permitted. Laboratory values of serum electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) are monitored. Vital signs are monitored hourly for signs of dehydration (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension) along with assessment of breath sounds, level of consciousness, presence of edema, and cardiac status (ECG rhythm strips).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>INCREASING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIABETES MANAGEMENT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The development of DKA or HHS suggests the need for the nurse to carefully assess the patient&#x2019;s understanding of and adherence to the diabetes management plan. Furthermore, factors that may have led to the development of DKA or HHS are explored with the patient and family. If the patient&#x2019;s blood glucose monitoring, dietary intake, use of antidiabetic medications (insulin or oral agents), and exercise patterns differ from those identified in the diabetes management plan, their relationship to the development of DKA or HHS is discussed, along with early manifestations of DKA or HHS. If other factors, such as trauma, illness, surgery, or stress, are implicated, appropriate strategies to respond to these and similar situations in the future are described so that the patient can respond in the future without developing life-threatening complications. The nurse may need to provide education about basic skills again to patients who may not be able to recall the instructions. If the patient has omitted insulin or oral antidiabetic agents that have been prescribed, the nurse explores the reasons for doing so and addresses those issues to prevent future recurrence and readmissions for treatment of these complications.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient has not previously been diagnosed with diabetes, the opportunity is used to educate the patient about the need for maintaining blood glucose at a normal level and learning about diabetes management and basic skills.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>DECREASING ANXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Educating the patient about cognitive strategies may be useful for relieving tension, overcoming anxiety, decreasing fear, and achieving relaxation (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). Examples include:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Imagery:</em> The patient concentrates on a pleasant experience or restful scene.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Distraction:</em> The patient thinks of an enjoyable story or recites a favorite poem or song.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Optimistic self-recitation:</em> The patient recites optimistic thoughts (&#x201C;I know all will go well&#x201D;).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Music:</em> The patient listens to soothing music (an easy-to-administer, inexpensive, noninvasive intervention).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4">Fluid Overload. Fluid overload can occur because of the administration of a large volume of fluid at a rapid rate, which is often required to treat patients with DKA or HHS. This risk is increased in older patients and in those with preexisting cardiac or kidney disease. To avoid fluid overload and resulting heart failure and pulmonary edema, the nurse monitors the patient closely during treatment by measuring vital signs and intake and output at frequent intervals. Central venous pressure monitoring and hemodynamic monitoring may be initiated to provide additional measures of fluid status. Physical examination focuses on assessment of cardiac rate and rhythm, breath sounds, venous distention, skin turgor, and urine output. The nurse monitors fluid intake and keeps careful records of IV and other fluid intake, along with urine output measurements.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4">Hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is a potential complication during the treatment of DKA. Low serum potassium levels may result from rehydration, increased urinary excretion of potassium, movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells with insulin administration, and restoration of the cellular sodium&#x2013;potassium pump. Prevention of hypokalemia includes cautious replacement of potassium; however, before its administration, it is important to ensure that a patient&#x2019;s kidneys are functioning. Because of the adverse effects of hypokalemia on cardiac function, monitoring of the cardiac rate, cardiac rhythm, ECG, and serum potassium levels is essential.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4">Cerebral Edema. Although the exact cause of cerebral edema is unknown, rapid correction of hyperglycemia, resulting in fluid shifts, is thought to be the cause. Cerebral edema, which occurs more often in children than in adults, can be prevented by a gradual reduction in the blood glucose level. An hourly flow sheet is used to enable close monitoring of the blood glucose level, serum electrolyte levels, fluid intake, urine output, mental status, and neurologic signs. Precautions are taken to minimize activities that could increase intracranial pressure.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> <strong><small>EDUCATING PATIENTS ABOUT SELF-CARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is educated about basic skills, including treatment modalities (diet, insulin administration, monitoring of blood glucose, and, for type 1 diabetes, monitoring of urine ketones); the patient is also educated about recognition, treatment, and prevention of DKA and HHS (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Down, 2018</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>). Education addresses those factors leading to DKA or HHS. Follow-up education is arranged with a home health nurse and dietitian or an outpatient diabetes education center. This is particularly important for patients who have experienced DKA or HHS because of the need to address factors that led to its occurrence (e.g., dehydration). For patients who have had HHS, avoiding dehydration and paying attention to increased urination or thirst are even more important than insulin administration. The importance of self-monitoring and of monitoring and follow-up by primary providers is reinforced, and the patient is reminded about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments.</p>
