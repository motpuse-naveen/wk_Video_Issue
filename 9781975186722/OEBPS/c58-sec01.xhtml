<h4 class="h4a" id="s2718">ASSESSMENT OF THE EYE</h4>
<h4 class="h4" id="s2719">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Unlike most organs of the body, the eye is available for external examination, and its anatomy is more easily assessed than other body parts (see <a href="#ff58-1">Fig. 58-1</a>). The eyeball, or globe, is situated in the bony protective orbit (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Shaw &#x0026; Lee, 2017</a>). Lined with muscle and connective and adipose tissues, the orbit is shaped like a four-sided pyramid, surrounded on three sides by the sinuses: ethmoid (medially), frontal (superiorly), and maxillary (inferiorly). The optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery enter the orbit at its apex through the optic foramen. The eyeball is moved through all fields of gaze by the extraocular muscles. The four rectus muscles and two oblique muscles (see <a href="#ff58-2">Fig. 58-2</a>) are innervated by cranial nerves (CNs) III, IV, and VI. Normally, the movements of the two eyes are coordinated and the brain perceives a single image.</p>

<p class="indent">The eyelids are composed of thin, elastic skin that covers striated and smooth muscles and protect the anterior portion of the eye. The eyelids contain multiple glands (sebaceous, sweat, and lacrimal). The upper lid normally covers the uppermost portion of the iris and is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III). The lid margins contain meibomian glands, the inferior and superior puncta, and the eyelashes. The triangular spaces formed by the junction of the eyelids are known as the inner or medial canthus and the outer or lateral canthus. With every blink, the eyelids wash the cornea and conjunctiva with tears.</p>
<p class="indent">Tears are vital to eye health. Formed by the lacrimal gland and the accessory lacrimal glands, tears are secreted in response to reflex or emotional stimuli. A healthy tear is composed of three layers: lipoid, aqueous, and mucoid. These layers nourish the cornea and create a smooth optical surface of the cornea and conjunctival epithelium. If there is a defect in the composition of any of these layers, the integrity of the cornea may be compromised.</p>
<p class="indent">The conjunctiva, a thin transparent mucous membrane, provides a barrier to the external environment extending under the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva) and over the sclera (bulbar conjunctiva). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1898" title="1898"></span>The junction of the two portions is known as the fornix. The conjunctiva meets the cornea at the limbus on the outermost edge of the iris.</p>

<p class="indent">The eyeball is composed of the following three layers:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>The outer dense fibrous layer, including the sclera and transparent cornea</li>
<li>The middle vascular layer, containing the iris, ciliary body, and choroid</li>
<li>The inner neural layer, including the retina, optic nerve, and visual pathway</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The eyeball is divided anatomically into two segments. The anterior segment is between the anterior cornea and posterior iris, including the anterior and posterior chambers. The posterior segment is between the posterior lens and the retina, including the vitreous chamber. The eyeball also has three fluid-containing chambers. The aqueous-filled <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anterior chamber:&lt;/b&gt; aqueous-containing space in the eye between the posterior (endothelial) cornea and the anterior iris and pupil">anterior chamber</button></strong> lies between the posterior cornea and the anterior iris and pupil. The posterior chamber is a small aqueous-containing space between the posterior iris and pupil and anterior lens. The vitreous chamber, containing clear gelatinous vitreous fluid, is the largest chamber in the ocular fundus between the lens and retina (see <a href="#ff58-3">Fig. 58-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aqueous humor:&lt;/b&gt; transparent, nutrient-containing fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye">aqueous humor</button></strong> is transparent, nutrient-containing fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers and helps give the eye its shape (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Moore, Dalley, &#x0026; Agur, 2018</a>). The aqueous is produced in the posterior chamber by the ciliary body; it flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber and drains through the trabecular meshwork into the canal of Schlemm. Production of aqueous humor is related to the intraocular pressure (IOP). Normal IOP is less than 21 mm Hg (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4199">Sihota, Angmo, Ramaswamy, et al., 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vitreous humor:&lt;/b&gt; transparent, colorless gelatinous material that fills the vitreous chamber behind the lens">Vitreous humor</button></strong>, which is composed mostly of water and encapsulated by a hyaloid membrane, helps maintain the shape of the eye. The vitreous is attached to the retina by scattered collagenous filaments. The vitreous shrinks and shifts with age. Through this degenerative process, the gel-like characteristics liquefy, causing stringy debris known as floaters.</p>
<p class="indent">The sclera is the white avascular dense fibrous structure that helps maintain the shape of the eyeball and protects the intraocular contents. Scleral thinning and changes of the scleral collagen fibers can cause the underlying uveal pigment to be seen, resulting in a blue or gray sclera. The episclera is a vascularized loose elastic tissue that overlies the sclera supplying nutritional support and reacting to inflammation.</p>
<p class="indent">The cornea, a vulnerable transparent avascular domelike structure, forms the most anterior portion of the eyeball and is the main refracting surface of the eye. It is composed of five layers: the epithelium, Bowman&#x2019;s membrane, stroma, Descemet&#x2019;s membrane, and endothelium. It contains high concentrations of nerve fibers and is extremely sensitive to pain. The epithelium, the outermost protective layer, absorbs oxygen and nutrients from the tear film nourishing the cornea. The epithelial cells readily regenerate, unlike the innermost endothelial cells, which do not regenerate and result in corneal edema when injured.</p>
<p class="indent">The uveal tract is the vascular middle layer of the eye consisting of the iris, ciliary body, and the choroid.</p>
<p class="indent">The iris surrounding the pupil is a highly vascularized pigmented collection of fibers that give the eye color. The dilator and sphincter muscles of the iris control pupil size. The dilator muscles are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The sphincter muscles are controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p class="indent">The ciliary body consists of ciliary processes, ciliary muscles, and zonular fibers (ligaments) that work together to form aqueous fluid and control focusing through the zonular fibers that suspend the crystalline lens.</p>
<p class="indent">The choroid lies between the retina and the sclera, supplying blood and oxygen to the outer retina. Pigmented cells containing melanocytes in the choroid assist to absorb scattered light.</p>
<p class="indent">Directly behind the pupil and iris lies the lens, an avascular and almost completely transparent biconvex structure held in position by zonular fibers in the ciliary body. The lens <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1899" title="1899"></span>enables focusing for near and distance vision through accommodation, the process by which the lens of the eye adjusts the focal length to focus a clear image on the retina. With aging and certain conditions (e.g., diabetes or trauma), the lens loses its transparency and ability to focus due to formation of a cataract (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">The retina&#x2014;the innermost surface of the fundus composed of neural tissue&#x2014;is an extension of the optic nerve. Viewed through the pupil, the landmarks of the retina are the optic disc, the retinal vessels, and the macula. The point of entrance of the optic nerve into the retina is the optic disc. The optic disc is pink, either oval or circular in shape, and has sharp margins. In the disc, a physiologic depression or cup is present centrally, with the retinal blood vessels emerging from it. The retinal tissues arise from the optic disc and line the inner surface of the vitreous chamber. The retinal vessels enter the eye through the optic disc, branching out through the retina and forming superior and inferior branches. The macula is the area of the retina responsible for central vision. The rest of the retina is responsible for peripheral vision. In the center of the macula is the most sensitive area&#x2014;the fovea&#x2014;which is avascular and surrounded by the superior and inferior vascular arcades. Two important layers of the retina are the retinal pigment epithelium and the sensory retina. A single layer of cells constitutes the retinal pigment epithelium. These cells have numerous functions, including the absorption of light. The sensory retina contains the photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. The rods are responsible for night or low light vision. The cones are retinal photoreceptor cells essential for visual acuity, color discrimination, and fine detail. Cones are distributed throughout the retina, with their greatest concentration in the fovea. Rods are absent in the fovea.</p>
<p class="indent">Visual acuity depends on a healthy functioning eye and an intact visual pathway. This pathway is made up of the retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracks, lateral geniculate bodies, optic radiations, and the visual cortex area of the brain. The visual pathway is part of the central nervous system (see <a href="c58-sec02.xhtml#ff58-4">Fig. 58-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The optic nerve (CN II) transmits impulses from the retina to the occipital lobe of the brain. The optic nerve head, or optic disc, is the physiologic blind spot in each eye. The optic nerve leaves the eye and then meets the optic nerve from the other eye at the optic chiasm. The chiasm is the anatomic point at which the nasal fibers from the nasal retina of each eye cross to the opposite side of the brain. The nerve fibers from the temporal retina of each eye remain uncrossed. Fibers from the right half of each eye, which would be the left visual field, carry impulses to the right occipital lobe. Fibers from the left half of each eye, or the right visual field, carry impulses to the left occipital lobe. Beyond the chiasm, these fibers are known as the optic tract. The optic tract continues on to the lateral geniculate body. The lateral geniculate body is connected by the optic radiations to the cortex of the occipital lobe of the brain.</p>
