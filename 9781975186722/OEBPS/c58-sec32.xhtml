<h4 class="h4" id="s2827">Enucleation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Enucleation is removal of the eyeball (globe) from the orbit, leaving the muscles and orbital contents intact. It may be surgically performed for the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Injury resulting in prolapse of uveal tissue or loss of light perception</li>
<li>A blind, painful, deformed, or disfigured eye, usually caused by glaucoma, retinal detachment, or chronic inflammation</li>
<li>An eye without useful vision that is producing or has produced sympathetic ophthalmia in the other eye</li>
<li>Intraocular tumors that are untreatable by other means</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The procedure for enucleation involves the separation and cutting of each of the ocular muscles and surrounding soft tissue and cutting of the optic nerve from the eyeball. The insertion of an orbital implant typically follows, and the conjunctiva is closed. A large pressure dressing is applied over the area.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evisceration:&lt;/b&gt; protrusion of organs through the surgical incision">Evisceration</button></strong> involves the removal of the intraocular contents through an incision or opening in the cornea or sclera. Evisceration may be surgically performed to treat severe ocular trauma with ruptured globe, severe ocular inflammation, or severe ocular infection. The optic nerve, sclera, extraocular muscles, and sometimes the cornea are left intact. The main advantage of evisceration over enucleation is that the final cosmetic result and motility after fitting the ocular prosthesis are enhanced.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;exenteration:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of the entire contents of the orbit, surrounding soft tissue, and most or all of the eyelids">Exenteration</button></strong> is the surgical removal of the entire contents of the orbit, surrounding soft tissue, and most or all of the eyelids. This surgery is indicated in malignancies of the orbit that are life-threatening or when more conservative modalities of treatment have failed or are inappropriate. An example is squamous cell carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses, skin, and conjunctiva with deep orbital involvement. In its most extensive form, exenteration may include the removal of all orbital tissues and resection of the orbital bones.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2828">Ocular Prostheses</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Orbital implants and conformers (ocular prostheses usually made of silicone rubber) maintain the shape of the eye after enucleation or evisceration to prevent a contracted, sunken appearance. The temporary conformer is placed over the conjunctival closure after the implantation of an orbital implant. A conformer is placed after the enucleation or evisceration procedure to protect the suture line, maintain the fornices, prevent contracture of the socket in preparation for the ocular prosthesis, and promote the integrity of the eyelids.</p>
<p class="indent">All ocular prosthetics have limitations in their motility. There are two designs of eye prostheses. The anophthalmic ocular prostheses are used in the absence of the globe. Scleral shells look just like the anophthalmic prosthesis (see <a href="#ff58-16">Fig. 58-16</a>) but are thinner and fit over a globe with intact corneal sensation. An eye prosthesis usually lasts about 6 years, depending on the quality of fit, comfort, and cosmetic appearance. When the anophthalmic socket is completely healed, conformers are replaced with prosthetic eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">An ocularist is a specially trained and skilled professional who makes prosthetic eyes. After the ophthalmologist <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1932" title="1932"></span>is satisfied that the anophthalmic socket is completely healed and is ready for prosthetic fitting, the patient is referred to an ocularist. The healing period is usually 6 to 8 weeks. It is advisable for the patient to have a consultation with the ocularist before the fitting. Obtaining accurate information and verbalizing concerns can lessen anxiety about wearing an ocular prosthesis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2829">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Removal of an eye has physical, social, and psychological ramifications for any person. The significance of loss of the eye and vision must be addressed in the plan of care. The patient&#x2019;s preparation should include information about the surgical procedure and placement of orbital implants and conformers and the availability of ocular prosthetics to enhance cosmetic appearance. In some cases, patients may choose to see an ocularist before the surgery to discuss ocular prosthetics.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2830">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Education About Postsurgical and Prosthetic Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who undergo eye removal need to know that they will usually have a large ocular pressure dressing, which is typically removed after a week, and that an ophthalmic topical antibiotic ointment is applied in the socket three times daily.</p>
<p class="indent">After the removal of an eye, there is a loss of depth perception. Patients must be advised to take extra caution in their ambulation and movement to avoid miscalculations that may result in injury. It may take some time to adjust to monocular vision.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient must be advised that conformers may inadvertently fall out of the socket. If this happens, the conformer must be washed, wiped dry, and placed back in the socket.</p>
<p class="indent">When surgical eye removal is unexpected, such as in severe ocular trauma, leaving no time for the patient and family to prepare for the loss, the nurse&#x2019;s role in providing emotional support is crucial.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a new prosthetic eye may need referral to home, community-based or transitional services that provide assistance in the home. These patients also benefit from a referral for rehabilitation services.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients need to be educated about how to insert, remove, and care for the prosthetic eye. Proper hand hygiene must be observed before inserting and removing an ocular prosthesis. A suction cup may be used if there are problems with manual dexterity. Precautions, such as draping a towel over the sink and closing the sink drain, must be taken to avoid loss of the prosthesis. When educating patients or family members, a return demonstration is important to assess the level of understanding and ability to perform the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Before insertion, the inner punctal or outer lateral aspects and the superior and inferior aspects of the prosthesis must be identified by locating the identifying marks, such as a reddish color in the inner punctal area. For people with low vision, other forms of identifying markers, such as dots or notches, are used. The upper lid is raised high enough to create a space and then the patient learns to slide the prosthesis up, underneath, and behind the upper eyelid. Meanwhile, the patient pulls the lower eyelid down to help put the prosthesis in place and to have its inferior edge fall back gradually to the lower eyelid. The lower eyelid is checked for correct positioning.</p>
<p class="indent">To remove the prosthesis, the patient cups one hand on the cheek to catch the prosthesis, places the forefinger of the free hand against the midportion of the lower eyelid, and gazes upward. Gazing upward brings the inferior edge of the prosthesis nearer the inferior eyelid margin. With the finger pushing inward, downward, and laterally against the lower eyelid, the prosthesis slides out into the cupped hand.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">An eye prosthesis can be worn and left in place for several months. Hygiene and comfort are usually maintained with daily irrigation of the prosthesis in place with normal saline solution, hard contact lens solution, or artificial tears. In the case of dry eye symptoms, the use of ophthalmic ointment lubricants or oil-based drops, such as vitamin E and mineral oil, can be helpful. Removing crusting and mucus discharge that accumulate overnight is performed with the prosthesis in place. Malpositions may occur when wiping or rubbing the prosthesis in the socket. The prosthesis can be repositioned with the use of clean fingers. Proper wiping of the prosthesis should be a gentle temporal-to-nasal motion to avoid malpositions.</p>
<p class="indent">The prosthesis needs to be removed and cleaned when it becomes uncomfortable and when there is increased mucus discharge. The socket should also be rendered free of mucus and inspected for any signs of infection. Any unusual discomfort, irritation, or redness of the globe or eyelids may indicate excessive wear, debris under the shell, or lack of proper hygiene. Any infection or irritation that does not resolve needs medical attention.</p>
