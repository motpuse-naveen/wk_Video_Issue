<h4 class="h4" id="s2640">Irritant Contact Dermatitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Contact dermatitis (also called <em>eczema</em>) is an inflammatory reaction of the skin to physical, chemical, or biologic agents. The epidermis is damaged by repeated physical and chemical irritations. Contact dermatitis may be of the primary irritant type, in which a nonallergic reaction results from exposure to an irritating substance, or it may be an allergic reaction resulting from exposure of sensitized people to contact allergens (see <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Common causes of irritant contact dermatitis are soaps, detergents, scouring compounds, and industrial chemicals. Predisposing factors include extremes of heat and cold, frequent contact with soap and water, and a preexisting skin disease. Persons at risk include those whose occupations require repeated handwashing (e.g., nurses) or repeated exposure to food or other irritants (e.g., food preparation workers, cleaners, hairdressers). Women tend to be affected more commonly than men (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Goldner &#x0026; Fransway, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2641">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The eruptions begin when the causative agent contacts the skin. The first reactions include pruritus, burning, and erythema, followed closely by edema, papules, vesicles, and oozing or weeping. In the subacute phase, these vesicular changes are less marked, and they occur alternatively with crusting, drying, fissuring, and peeling. If repeated reactions occur or if the patient continually scratches the skin, lichenification and pigmentation occur. Secondary bacterial invasion may follow (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Goldner &#x0026; Fransway, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2642">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of management are to soothe and heal the involved skin and protect it from further damage. The distribution pattern of the reaction is identified to differentiate between allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. A detailed history is obtained. If possible, the offending irritant is removed. Local irritation should be avoided, and soap is not generally used until healing occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">Many preparations are advocated for relieving dermatitis. In general, a barrier cream that contains ceramide or dimethicone is used for small patches of erythema. A thin layer of cream or ointment containing a corticosteroid is commonly used, although the efficacy of corticosteroids has not been demonstrated in research (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Goldner &#x0026; Fransway, 2018</a>). The patient is educated about how to treat and prevent future bouts of irritant contact dermatitis (<a href="#ct56-4">Chart 56-4</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2643"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtv1.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The first known outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and quickly spread through the province <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1842" title="1842"></span>of Hubei. Working for long hours caring for patients with COVID-19, Hubei health care workers (HCWs), including nurses and physicians, wore PPE, such as N95 respirators, goggles, face shields, double gloves, and gowns, for extended hours (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for discussion on PPE). In addition, HCWs spent more time than typical engaging in hand hygiene protocols. As a consequence of these practices that were aimed at protecting themselves and others from SARS-CoV-2 infection, many HCWs on the frontlines of the pandemic in Hubei reported high rates of irritant contact dermatitis. One study of 700 frontline HCWs reported an overall prevalence of irritant contact dermatitis of 97%, with 83.1% of HCWs reporting nasal bridge irritation, presumably from prolonged usage of N95 respirators and goggles (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4062">Lan, Song, Miao, et al., 2020</a>). Another group of researchers found that among 61 frontline HCWs, 68.9% reported nasal bridge scarring. These same researchers reported that the incidence of adverse skin reactions to N95 respirators was 95.1%, to gloves 88.5%, and to other PPE 60.7% (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4054">Hu, Fan, Li, et al., 2020</a>). In response to these reports, the AAD promulgated a white paper of guidelines that HCWs could adopt to avoid occupationally induced skin disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key recommendations include the following (AAD, 2020):</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Strategies for Avoiding Irritant Contact Dermatitis</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The precautions listed below may help prevent repeated cases of irritant contact dermatitis and should be followed for at least 4 months after skin appears to be completely healed.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Study the pattern and location of your dermatitis and think about which things have touched your skin and which things may have caused the problem; try to avoid contact with these materials.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid heat, soap, and rubbing, all of which are external irritants.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Choose bath soaps, laundry detergents, and cosmetics that do not contain fragrance.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid using a fabric softener dryer sheet. Fabric softeners that are added to the washer may be used.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid topical medications, lotions, or ointments, except those specifically prescribed for your condition.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wash your skin thoroughly immediately after exposure to possible irritants.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ensure that when wearing gloves (such as for washing dishes or general cleaning), they are cotton lined. Do not wear them more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time.</p>

<ul class="bull56"><li>HCWs should use a moisturizer after engaging in hand hygiene. Continued hand moisturization when off work is also recommended in order to better protect the skin. Moisturizers that contain at least 5% petrolatum are most effective.</li>
<li>If an HCW uses an N95 respirator that is irritating, the HCW should notify their respective safety officer and request an alternative N95 respirator that might be less irritating. If that is not possible, then a liquid skin sealant/protectant should be applied to the irritated area and dried before the mask is donned. Petrolatum should <em>not</em> be used as a protectant, however, as it can interfere with the seal of the mask.</li>
<li>All HCWs who utilize PPE should keep their skin clean, dry, and well-moisturized. In particular, the face should be well-moisturized when off work. Cosmetics that include foundations and concealers should not be used. If skin moisturizers are applied, they should be applied at least one hour prior to donning PPE. Irritated areas, particularly the forehead, cheeks, and bridge of the nose, may be treated with petrolatum when off work.</li>
<li>If masks must be reused, they should be thoroughly dry before they are donned a second time.</li></ul>
