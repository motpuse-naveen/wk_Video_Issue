<h4 class="h4" id="s1786">The Patient Undergoing Bariatric Surgery</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bariatric:&lt;/b&gt; relating to obesity; term derives from two Greek words meaning &#x201C;weight&#x201D; and &#x201C;treatment&#x201D;">bariatric</button></strong> is derived from two Greek words meaning &#x201C;weight&#x201D; and &#x201C;treatment.&#x201D; Thus, bariatric surgery is surgery indicated to treat obesity. Surgery is typically performed after other nonsurgical attempts at weight control have failed. Insurance coverage for bariatric surgery varies widely, but most insurance companies will consider surgery as a treatment if the patient has Class III obesity or Class II obesity with a related medical condition (e.g., type 2 diabetes, OSA) (see <a href="c42-sec01.xhtml#tt42-1">Table 42-1</a>) (Obesity Action Coalition [OAC], 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">According to estimates by the ASMBS (2018b), the number of bariatric surgeries performed in the United States grew by nearly 30% between 2011 and 2017. Bariatric surgical procedures work by restricting a patient&#x2019;s ability to eat (restrictive procedure), interfering with ingested nutrient absorption (malabsorptive procedures), or both. The different types of bariatric surgical procedures require unique lifestyle modifications. In order to optimize their success, patients should be well informed about the specific lifestyle changes, eating habits, and bowel habits that may result from each type of procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Bariatric surgery typically results in a weight loss of 10% to 35% of total body weight within 2 years postoperatively, with the majority of weight loss occurring within the first year (OAC, 2019b; Shanti &#x0026; Patel, 2019). Comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and OSA may resolve; and dyslipidemia improves (<a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Shanti &#x0026; Patel, 2019</a>). Bariatric surgery has been extended to carefully selected adolescents with severe obesity and comorbidity because of the positive results it has achieved in adults (<a href="#bib3225">Ruiz-Cota, Bacard&#x00ED;-Gasc&#x00F3;n, &#x0026; Jim&#x00E9;nez-Cruz, 2019</a>). However, the long-term benefits for patients who undergo bariatric surgery during adolescence are debatable, as weight regain and risk reduction of comorbidities tend to resume within 5 years postoperatively (<a href="#bib3256">Ruiz-Cota et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patient selection is critical, and the preliminary process may necessitate months of counseling, education, and evaluation by a multidisciplinary team, including social workers, dietitians, a nurse counselor, a psychologist or psychiatrist, and a bariatric surgeon. The selection criteria for patients has changed considerably since the advent of bariatric surgery, with patients with BMIs as low as 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> now considered candidates for surgical intervention if they have comorbid conditions that may demonstrably improve post weight loss (e.g., type 2 diabetes) (Nguyen et al., 2020; NIDDK, 2016a) (see <a href="#ct42-6">Chart 42-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because bariatric surgery involves a drastic change in the functioning of the digestive system, patients need counseling before and after the surgery. Guidelines have been developed to assist in the care of patients having bariatric surgery (<a href="#bib3205">Mechanick, Apovian, Brethauer, et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1787">Surgical Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, and gastric banding are the current bariatric procedures that might be performed. These procedures may be performed by laparoscopy or by an open surgical technique. Currently, the sleeve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1355" title="1355"></span>gastrectomy is the most commonly performed procedure, followed by the RYGB; postoperative outcomes are equally favorable between sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB, and generally better than outcomes with gastric banding (ASMBS, 2018b; Kizy, Jahansouz, Downey, et al., 2017; <a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>). Gastric banding tends to be done less commonly, as there have been reports of problems with band failures and a need for more frequent patient postoperative monitoring (<a href="#bib3235">Tsai, Zehetner, Beel, et al., 2019</a>). Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch tends to result in the most postoperative weight loss, and is therefore more commonly indicated for patients with very high BMIs (<a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The RYGB is a combined restrictive and malabsorptive procedure. The gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy are restrictive procedures, and the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch combines gastric restriction with intestinal malabsorption. Figure 42-5A&#x2013;D provides additional details about these procedures.</p>

<p class="processppara">Preoperatively, the nurse assesses for contraindications to major abdominal surgery. Previous attempts at losing weight are also assessed, including strategies such as nutritional counseling, dieting, or exercise programs. The nurse ensures the patient has received education and counseling regarding the possible risks and benefits of bariatric surgery including the complications, postsurgical outcomes, dietary changes, and the need for lifelong follow-up. The nurse also confirms that the patient has been screened for behavioral disorders that may interfere with postsurgical outcomes. Dietary counseling is initiated preoperatively to prepare for postoperative dietary changes (Mechanick et al., 2019; OAC, 2019b).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse ensures that preoperative screening tests are obtained and scrutinizes the results. Typical laboratory tests include a complete blood cell count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. See Appendix A on <img class="m" src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/> for normal values for these laboratory tests. Patients with obesity may have OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), heart disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes (or prediabetes), and vitamin and mineral deficiencies; thus, other screening tests that may be obtained include a sleep study, upper endoscopy, electrocardiogram (ECG), lipid panel, AST, ALT, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c, as well as iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, thiamine, folate, vitamin D, and calcium levels.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Postoperatively, the nurse assesses the patient to ensure that goals for recovery are met and that the patient exhibits absence of complications secondary to the surgical intervention. See <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a> for general assessment of the postoperative patient.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>NURSING DIAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about the nature of the surgical procedure, dietary limitations, and activities</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with impending surgery</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with surgical procedure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for hypovolaemia associated with nausea, gastric irritation, and pain</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for infection associated with anastomotic leak</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional status associated with dietary restrictions</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disturbed body image associated with body changes from bariatric surgery</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Change in bowel habits, including diarrhea and/or constipation</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hemorrhage</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Venous thromboembolism (VTE)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Bile reflux</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Dumping syndrome</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Dysphagia</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Bowel or gastric outlet obstruction</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Preoperative goals include that the patient will become knowledgeable about the preoperative and postoperative dietary routine/restrictions and will have decreased anxiety about the surgery. Postoperative goals include relief of pain, maintenance of homeostatic fluid balance, prevention of infection, adherence to detailed diet instructions to include progression of food intake as well as fluid intake (to prevent dehydration), knowledge about vitamin supplements and the need for lifelong follow-up, achievement of a positive body image, and maintenance of normal bowel habits (ASMBS, 2013; <a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small><img class="m" src="images/icon21.png" alt=""/> Fostering Patient Knowledge</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Although care of patients with obesity who are undergoing surgery is best achieved with a multidisciplinary care team, nurses have the opportunity to lead patient education initiatives. A systematic review noted that weight management centers within and outside of the United States have not extensively tested education practices for their effectiveness (<a href="#bib3183">Groller, 2017</a>). Furthermore, patient education was not comparable across centers with much variance between educational content and delivery practices specific to teaching style and educator role (<a href="#bib3183">Groller, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Education for patients undergoing bariatric surgery should include information on the surgical procedure, nutrition requirements, activity, and psychosocial behaviors (<a href="#bib3183">Groller, 2017</a>). Providing this education to patients in small group and individualized teaching sessions will enable patients to ask questions and have the nurse evaluate patient understanding to promote adherence to the treatment plan.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse counsels the patient anticipating bariatric surgery to ingest nothing but clear liquids for a specified period of time preoperatively (typically about 24 to 48 hours before). Nutritional support for patients scheduled for bariatric surgery is tailored to meet each patient&#x2019;s individual need to ensure optimal consumption of micronutrients. Bariatric diets usually follow a slow progression from clear liquids only continuing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1356" title="1356"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1357" title="1357"></span>for up to 48 hours postoperatively, to full liquids with sugar-free or low sugar options, to pureed diet, to soft solids and, eventually by approximately the 8-week postoperative time frame, to solid foods (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Petcu, 2017</a>). This slow progression is necessary to maximize weight loss, and to prevent complications such as nausea, vomiting, bile reflux, and diarrhea.</p>

A horizontal row of staples across the fundus of the stomach creates a pouch with a capacity of 20 to 30 mL. The jejunum is divided distal to the ligament of Treitz, and the distal end is anastomosed to the new pouch. The proximal segment is anastomosed to the jejunum. <strong>B.</strong> Gastric banding. A prosthetic device is used to restrict oral intake by creating a small pouch of 10 to 15 mL that empties through the narrow outlet into the remainder of the stomach. <strong>C.</strong> Sleeve gastrectomy. The stomach is incised vertically and up to 85% of the stomach is surgically removed, leaving a &#x201C;sleeve&#x201D;-shaped tube that retains intact nervous innervation and does not obstruct or decrease the size of the gastric outlet. <strong>D.</strong> Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (also called <em>sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal switch</em>). Half of the stomach is removed, leaving a small area that holds about 60 mL. The entire jejunum is excluded from the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. The duodenum is disconnected and sealed off. The ileum is divided above the ileocecal junction, and the distal end of the jejunum is anastomosed to the first portion of the duodenum. The distal end of the biliopancreatic limb is anastomosed to the ileum.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s diet likely will be limited upon discharge from the hospital; because of this, patients scheduled for bariatric surgery are given guidelines prior to surgery on which foods and liquids they may consume postoperatively so that they may stock up on these items at home before they are admitted to the hospital. These typically include sugar-free drinks, gelatins and puddings, flavored electrolyte drinks, fat-free milk, protein drinks, sugar-free applesauce, and low-fat soups (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Petcu, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>REDUCING ANXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse provides the patient preparing for bariatric surgery anticipatory guidance as to what to expect during the surgery and postoperatively. In addition, the nurse may encourage the patient to join a bariatric surgery support group preoperatively, with the intent that the patient will continue to participate in this group postoperatively. Most bariatric surgery centers sponsor patient support groups that meet in person or online. These support groups provide a forum where patients contemplating bariatric surgery may talk with patients who have had the surgery and may provide them with guidance and tips that can help to lessen their anxiety (<a href="#bib3205">Mechanick et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>RELIEVING PAIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After surgery, analgesic agents may be given as prescribed to relieve pain and discomfort. In the past, patient-controlled analgesic pumps were used postoperatively; however, this is no longer recommended practice (<a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>). The opioid crisis has stimulated research to question opioid prescription and use practices in this population (<a href="#bib3189">Heinberg, Pudalov, Alameddin, et al., 2019</a>). New recommendations favor nonopioid agents and restriction to no more than 15 doses of oral opioids during any postoperative recovery (<a href="#bib3178">Friedman, Ghiassi, Hubbard, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>). Patients are usually prescribed oral immediate-release opioids (e.g., oxycodone) and other nonopioid agents, such as acetaminophen. The nurse should educate the patient about these medications and monitor their effectiveness. It is especially important to provide adequate pain relief so that the patient can perform pulmonary care activities (deep breathing and coughing) and leg exercises, turn from side to side, and ambulate. The nurse assesses the effectiveness of analgesic intervention and consults with other members of the health care team if pain is not adequately controlled (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). Positioning the patient in a low or high Fowler position promotes comfort and emptying of the stomach after any type of gastric surgery, including bariatric procedures.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>ENSURING FLUID VOLUME BALANCE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients who have had bariatric surgery usually receive IV fluids for the first several hours postoperatively. Once they are awake and alert on the surgical unit, they are encouraged to begin intake of sugar-free oral fluids. Introducing small volumes of these liquids is believed to stimulate GI peristalsis and perfusion and thwart gastric reflux. Sugar-free fluids are preferred because they are not implicated in causing dumping syndrome (see later discussion). With a typical regimen, patients are encouraged to slowly sip 30 mL of these fluids every 15 minutes (<a href="#bib3256">Fencl, Walsh, &#x0026; Vocke, 2015</a>). Patients should stop ingesting fluids, however, if they feel nauseated or full. Antiemetic agents may be prescribed to relieve nausea and prevent vomiting, which could cause strain on the surgical site and cause either a hemorrhage or anastomotic leak (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>PREVENTING INFECTION/ANASTOMOTIC LEAK</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Disruption at the site of anastomosis (i.e., surgically resected site) may cause leakage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing infection and possible sepsis. Patients at risk for this particular complication tend to be older, male, and with greater body mass. In addition, anastomotic leak is more commonly associated with open rather than laparoscopic procedures. Patients with anastomotic leaks typically exhibit nonspecific signs and symptoms that include fever, abdominal pain, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. This may progress to sepsis and possibly septic shock if not recognized and treated early (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). The nurse must be astute in recognizing these manifestations and alerting the patient&#x2019;s primary provider should they occur (<a href="#bib3256">Petcu, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A patient suspected of having an anastomotic leak may have an upper GI series that includes follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast dye, which may find leaking contrast dye, thus confirming the diagnosis. Treatment varies depending on the timing (early or late postoperatively) and severity of the leak. CT-guided drainage of the area may be appropriate for a less severe leak in the later postoperative phase of recovery, but an early or severe leak requires immediate open surgical intervention to repair the leak (<a href="#bib3256">Petcu, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>ENSURING ADEQUATE NUTRITIONAL STATUS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After bowel sounds have returned and oral intake is resumed, six small feedings consisting of a total of 600 to 800 calories per day are provided, and consumption of fluids between meals is encouraged to prevent dehydration. The nurse instructs the patient to eat slowly and stop when feeling full. Eating too much or too fast or eating high-calorie liquids and soft foods can result in vomiting or painful esophageal distention. Gastric retention may be evidenced by abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting. A nutritionist is typically consulted to assist with diet restrictions and diet progression (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>) (see <a href="#ct42-7">Chart 42-7</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Common dietary deficiencies in patients who have had bariatric surgery include malabsorption of organic iron, which may require supplementation with oral or parenteral iron, and a low serum level of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; the patient may be prescribed monthly vitamin B<sub>12</sub> intramuscular injections to prevent pernicious anemia (<a href="#bib3256">Holsworth &#x0026; Gallagher, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for further discussion of pernicious anemia).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>SUPPORTING BODY IMAGE CHANGES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After bariatric surgery most patients report greatly improved perceptions of their body image, as well as improved quality of life. In particular, patients identified satisfaction with bariatric surgery when they achieved personal weight goals, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1358" title="1358"></span>adhered to postoperative care rules, and saw physical health improvements (<a href="#bib3184">Groller, Teel, Stegenga, et al., 2018</a>). However, some patients report lingering dissatisfaction with their body images. In particular, some patients may report dissatisfaction related to loose skin folds and may eventually seek elective body-contouring surgical options (e.g., breast reductions, breast lifts, abdominoplasty) (<a href="#bib3184">Groller et al., 2018</a>). The nurse provides support to the patient who reports dissatisfaction with body image post weight loss by acknowledging the patient&#x2019;s feelings as real, sharing that these perceptions are not unusual, and providing links to live or online supports groups or counselors, as necessary (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct42-8">Chart 42-8</a>).</p>
<div class="box11a"><p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct42-7"><strong>Chart 42-7</strong> <img class="m" src="images/icon21.png" alt=""/> <strong>PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Dietary Guidelines for the Patient Who Has Had Bariatric Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eat smaller but more frequent meals that contain protein and fiber; each meal size should not exceed 1 cup.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eat only foods high in nutrients (e.g., peanut butter, cheese, chicken, fish, beans).</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Consume fat as tolerated.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ensure a low carbohydrate intake; in particular, avoid concentrated sources of carbohydrates (e.g., candy).</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eat two protein snacks daily; animal protein may be poorly tolerated after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, however.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eat slowly and chew thoroughly or may feel food &#x201C;sticking&#x201D; in throat.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assume a low Fowler position during mealtime and then remain in that position for 20 to 30 minutes after mealtime&#x2014;this delays stomach emptying and decreases the likelihood of dumping syndrome.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Know that antispasmodic agents, as prescribed, also may aid in delaying the emptying of the stomach.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid drinking fluid with meals; instead, consume fluids up to 30 minutes before a meal and 60 minutes after mealtime.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do drink plenty of water; refrain from drinking liquid calories (e.g., alcoholic beverages, fruit drinks, nondiet sodas).</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take prescribed dietary supplements of vitamins and medium-chain triglycerides.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After surgery, the nurse assesses the patient for complications from the bariatric surgery, such as changes in bowel habits, hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism (VTE), bile reflux, dumping syndrome, dysphagia, and bowel or gastric outlet obstruction.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Change in Bowel Habits</span>. Patients may complain of either diarrhea or constipation postoperatively. Diarrhea is more common an occurrence after bariatric surgery, particularly after malabsorptive procedures (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>). Both may be prevented if the patient consumes a nutritious diet that is high in fiber. Steatorrhea also may occur as a result of rapid gastric emptying, which prevents adequate mixing with pancreatic and biliary secretions (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>). In mild cases, reducing the intake of fat and administering an antimotility medication (e.g., loperamide) may control symptoms. Persistent diarrhea or steatorrhea may warrant further diagnostic testing, such as an upper endoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsies to rule out the presence of additional pathology, such as celiac disease or <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Hemorrhage.</span> Postoperative hemorrhage may be a complication following bariatric surgery. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage may be evident by frank, bright red oral or rectal bleeding, tarry melena, bloody output from the wound or drains, if present, as well as typical clinical manifestations of severe bleeding and hemorrhagic shock (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, syncope) (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Bleeding within the first 72 hours postoperatively is most likely caused by disruption in a staple or suture. Bleeding 72 hours to 30 days postoperatively is most likely from formation of a gastric or duodenal ulcer (<a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Petcu, 2017</a>) (see <a href="c40.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Venous Thromboembolism.</span> Patients who have bariatric surgery are at moderate to high risk of VTE, including both PE and DVT. Patients who are older, have higher BMIs, and have a prior history of a VTE or coagulation defect are at higher risk (<a href="#bib3256">Holsworth &#x0026; Gallagher, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>). ASMBS guidelines for VTE prevention specify that in the immediate postoperative period, patients who have had bariatric surgery should be prescribed mechanical compression (e.g., intermittent pneumatic compression devices) and prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) agents (e.g., dalteparin, enoxaparin). The duration of time that mechanical compression and anticoagulation should continue postoperatively is not described, however, and is left to the discretion of the patient and primary provider. In addition to implementing this prescribed therapy, nurses caring for patients post bariatric surgery should encourage them to begin early ambulation to further deter the advent of VTE (<a href="#bib3256">Holsworth &#x0026; Gallagher, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>) (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Bile Reflux.</span> Bile reflux may occur with procedures that manipulate or remove the pylorus, which acts as a barrier to the reflux of duodenal contents. Reflux of bile can cause gastritis or esophagitis (inflammation of the stomach or esophagus, respectively). Burning epigastric pain and vomiting of bilious material manifest this condition. Eating or vomiting does not relieve the symptoms. Bile reflux may be managed with proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) (<a href="#bib3256">Nguyen et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Dumping Syndrome.</span> <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dumping syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; physiologic response to rapid emptying of gastric contents into the small intestine; manifested by nausea, weakness, sweating, palpitations, syncope, and possibly diarrhea (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; vagotomy syndrome)">Dumping syndrome</button></strong> is an unpleasant set of vasomotor and GI symptoms that commonly occur in patients who have had bariatric surgery. For many years, it had been theorized that the hypertonic gastric food boluses that quickly transit into the intestines drew extracellular fluid from the circulating blood volume into the small intestines to dilute the high concentration of electrolytes and sugars, resulting in symptoms. Now, it is thought that this rapid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1359" title="1359"></span>transit of the food bolus from the stomach into the small intestines instead causes a rapid and exuberant release of metabolic peptides that are responsible for the symptoms of dumping syndrome (<a href="#bib3256">Mattar &#x0026; Rogers, 2020</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Patient Experiences with Education and Satisfaction in Weight Loss Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Groller, K. D., Teel, C., Stegenga, K. H., et al. (2018). Patient perspectives about bariatric surgery unveil experiences, education, satisfaction, and recommendations for improvement. <em>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</em>, <em>14</em>(6), 785&#x2013;796.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Accreditation standards require weight management centers to provide programs before and after weight loss surgery (WLS) to educate and support patients throughout lifestyle transitions. The educational programs offered at weight management centers vary by curriculum, timing, and delivery approach and may not be evidence based or patient centered. Despite these educational efforts, up to 35% of patients who undergo WLS will experience some type of weight recidivism (gain) within the first 2 postoperative years. Patient risk of regaining 5% or more from maximum weight lost continues to increase each year postoperatively. First-line treatment for patients who regain previously lost weight after WLS is to enroll and participate in additional educational programs that reinforce previously learned concepts about lifestyle demands post surgery. This study sought to obtain patient perspectives about their WLS journey with emphasis on their experiences with education, satisfaction, and recommendations to enhance the experience for future patients.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This qualitative descriptive study used a purposive sampling method to recruit adult patients from an accredited weight management center. Fifty percent of all WLS cases completed within the previous 6 months were randomly selected and were mailed an invitation letter to participate in the research study. English-speaking adult patients who responded to the invitation letter were interviewed. All 11 participants, 36% male, participated in an audio-recorded interview with one researcher using a semistructured interview guide. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and evaluated using Colaizzi&#x2019;s method for inductive content analysis. Interview responses were categorized and grouped into codes, subthemes, and main themes once data saturation was achieved. Member-checking occurred to confirm final themes and subthemes that emerged from the interview data.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study sample was fairly homogenous and oversampled males to obtain perspectives from both genders. The concept of A New Me-Version 2.0 included three main themes that emerged from participant interviews. Programming and Tools (Theme 1) provided insight on how individuals undergoing WLS obtained support from the weight management center program. Updates and Upgrades (Theme 2) explained lifestyle challenges and routines before and after WLS and quality-of-life concerns. The last theme, Lessons Learned and Future Considerations (Theme 3), described satisfaction level through the lived experience and provided suggestions for improving the experience for future patients.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Results from this study provide insight into the lived WLS patient experience. Through emerged themes, WLS success was associated with meeting weight goals, adhering to new lifestyle routines, and seeing improved health. Participants emphasized education efforts should focus on explaining program objectives, incorporating technology to support monitoring of holistic transformations, and fostering a network of community members. This study also identified the need for future research to develop WLS education best practices and study the impact WLS education has on clinical outcomes.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Symptoms of dumping syndrome typically occur within a few minutes to 2 hours after eating and include tachycardia, dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea (<a href="#bib3256">Mattar &#x0026; Rogers, 2020</a>). These symptoms typically resolve once the intestine has been evacuated (i.e., with defecation). Later, blood glucose rises rapidly, followed by increased insulin secretion. This results in a reactive hypoglycemia, which also is unpleasant for the patient. Vasomotor symptoms that occur 10 to 90 minutes after eating include pallor, perspiration, palpitations, headache, and feelings of warmth, dizziness, and even drowsiness. Anorexia may also result from dumping syndrome, because the patient may be reluctant to eat (<a href="#bib3256">Mattar &#x0026; Rogers, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Dysphagia.</span> <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysphagia:&lt;/b&gt; difficulty swallowing">Dysphagia</button></strong>, or difficulty swallowing, may occur in patients who have had any type of restrictive bariatric procedure. If it occurs, it tends to be most severe 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively and may persist for up to 6 months after surgery. Dysphagia may be prevented by educating patients to eat slowly, to chew food thoroughly, and to avoid eating tough foods such as steak or dry chicken or doughy bread. Patients with severe dysphagia who have had gastric banding may benefit from having their bands adjusted. Patients who have had other restrictive procedures may experience relief of symptoms after having stomal strictures relieved endoscopically (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Bowel and Gastric Outlet Obstruction.</span> Bowel or gastric outlet obstruction may occur as a complication of bariatric surgery. The typical manifestations and treatments of gastric outlet obstruction are described in <a href="c40.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>; however, there is a key difference in the treatment of a patient who has undergone bariatric surgery with a gastric outlet obstruction. It is contraindicated to insert a nasogastric (NG) tube in patients that have had bariatric surgery, even if they have a gastric outlet obstruction. Alternative treatment options may include endoscopic procedures aimed at relieving the obstruction, such as balloon dilation, or surgical revisions (<a href="#bib3256">King &#x0026; Herron, 2020</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>PROMOTING HOME, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND TRANSITIONAL CARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients are usually discharged from the hospital within 4 days postoperatively (this may be within 24 to 72 hours for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1360" title="1360"></span>patients who have had laparoscopic procedures) with detailed dietary instructions (see <a href="#ct42-7">Chart 42-7</a>) as well as instructions about how to either begin or resume an appropriate exercise regimen. Instructions on making follow-up appointments with the bariatric surgeon for routine postoperative visits or for complications are shared with the patient (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="nonindent"><img style="float:left;" class="t" src="images/icon21.png" alt=""/> <span class="orange">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The nurse provides education with the patient about nutrition, nutritional supplements, pain management, the importance of physical activity, and the symptoms of dumping syndrome and measures to prevent or minimize these symptoms. Patients who undergo laparoscopic or open RYGB procedures may have one or more Jackson&#x2013;Pratt drains, which may remain in place after discharge. The nurse educates the patient or caregiver about how to empty, measure, and record the amount of drainage. Patients should be instructed to avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen) post discharge, as they have been implicated in development of stomach ulcers (<a href="#bib3256">Mechanick et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3256">Peterson &#x0026; Kempenich, 2020</a>). The nurse must emphasize the continued need for follow-up (even after weight loss goals are met) and continued support group participation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="orange">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> After bariatric surgery, all patients require lifelong monitoring of weight, comorbidities, metabolic and nutritional status, and dietary and activity behaviors because they are at risk for developing malnutrition or weight gain. Women of childbearing age who have bariatric surgery are advised to use contraceptives for at least 18 months after surgery to avoid pregnancy until their weight stabilizes. After weight loss, the patient may elect additional surgical interventions for body contouring. These may include breast reductions, lipoplasty to remove fat deposits, or a panniculectomy or abdominoplasty to remove excess abdominal skin folds (Mechanick et al., 2019; OAC, 2019b).</p>
