<h4 class="h4" id="s454">Special Considerations during the Perioperative Period</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In an effort to reduce surgical complications, The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) developed National Patient Safety Goals. The goals are updated yearly and identify performance measures aimed at preventing surgical complications, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), surgical site infections (SSIs), and wrong-site surgery related to positive patient identification (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1242">Joint Commission, 2019</a>). On the day of surgery, the preoperative nurse should verify the list of home medications with the patient and, if applicable, confirm which medications the patient discontinued and when they were last taken. This information assists providers in understanding the patient&#x2019;s medical conditions and helps to avoid medication interactions between what patients take at home and what is administered to them during surgery (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Ubaldi, 2019</a>). For example, particular beta-blockers taken within 24 hours of surgery are associated with improved perioperative cardiovascular outcomes. If the patient has not taken the usual dosage of this medication, the anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) must evaluate whether or not it should be administered prior to surgery or during the perioperative period. The nurse in the perioperative area needs to be alert for appropriate preoperative prescriptions aimed at preventing VTE and SSIs. If these prescriptions are not present, they should be requested so that appropriate treatment begins before the start of surgery.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The hazards of surgery for older adults are proportional to the number and severity of comorbidities and the nature and duration of the operative procedure. Anesthesia associated with these surgeries can precipitate the dysregulation of older adult physiology. Identification of at-risk older adult patients is important in determining the appropriate operative risk and management (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1252">Vernon, Rice, Titch, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Cardiac reserves are lower, renal and hepatic functions are depressed, and gastrointestinal activity is likely to be reduced. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment that focuses on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems may help improve immediate perioperative outcomes (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). See <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="c08-sec02.xhtml#tt8-1">Table&#x00A0;8-1</a> for additional age-related changes.</p>
<p class="indent">In the preoperative period, the nurse pays careful attention to the integumentary system of the patient as it can reveal pertinent data about the patient&#x2019;s health status. Assessment includes the overall condition of the skin, and determination of any bruises, abrasions, and discolorations (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Phillips, 2017</a>). Precautions are taken when moving an older adult. Decreased subcutaneous fat makes older adults more susceptible to temperature changes. A lightweight cotton blanket is an appropriate cover when an older patient is moved to and from the OR but never replaces asking patients if they feel sufficiently warm and attending to their needs.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 399</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page400" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="400">p. 400</span></div>
<p class="indent">The older adult is at a higher risk of cardiovascular complications. Of all the body systems, the cardiovascular system exerts the most influence on anesthesia. The older adult patient usually has decreased or slow circulation to the rest of the body. A preoperative assessment, including blood tests, blood pressure, and EKG, can identify potential risks including anemia, hypertension, and arrhythmias (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Phillips, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to physical risks, the older adult should be assessed for poor memory and cognition. When older adults are in a vulnerable and stressful state, such as preparing for surgery, they may show poor concentration, confusion, and disorganized thought patterns (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). Nurses must educate patients and caregivers about appropriate pain management and encourage good communication to obtain greater postoperative pain relief. Older adults may need multiple education formats (verbal and print) along with extra time in order to understand and retain what is communicated (see Providing Patient Education section).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s456"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Bariatric Patients</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bariatrics:&lt;/b&gt; having to do with patients with obesity">Bariatrics</button></strong> is a specialty that revolves around diagnosing, treating, and managing patients with obesity. The prevalence of obesity is approximately 39.8% and affects about 93.3 million adults in the United States (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1235">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018</a>). Obesity increases the risk and severity of complications associated with surgery. Preoperative assessment of the patient with obesity should pay careful attention to pulmonary, cardiovascular, psychological, and integumentary systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with obesity have more subcutaneous fat. The increase in adipose tissue can result in difficult intravenous (IV) access and delayed wound healing at the incision site (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). Obesity is also associated with increased SSIs and joint replacement failure. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 45 are at a significantly increased risk for total joint replacement failure and postoperative infection (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Boudreaux &#x0026; Simmons, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with obesity tends to have shallow respirations when supine, increasing the risk of hypoventilation and postoperative pulmonary complications. Additionally, diagnosed and undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among patients with obesity. Since these apnea and hypopnea events occur during sleep, most patients with OSA may not be aware that they have the condition. It has been estimated that up to 80% of individuals with moderate to severe OSA may remain undiagnosed and untreated (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Chung, Abdullah, &#x0026; Liao, 2016</a>). Positive identification of OSA and OSA risks can dramatically reduce intubation and postoperative complications (see <a href="c18.xhtml">Chapter 18</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s457">Patients with Disability</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Special considerations for patients with mental or physical disability include the need for appropriate assistive devices, modifications in preoperative education, and additional assistance with and attention to positioning or transferring. Assistive devices include hearing aids, eyeglasses, braces, prostheses, and other devices. People who are hearing impaired may need and are entitled by law to a sign interpreter or some alternative communication system perioperatively. If the patient relies on signing or speech (lip) reading and their eyeglasses or contact lenses are removed or the health care staff wears surgical masks, an alternative method of communication will be needed. These needs must be identified in the preoperative evaluation and clearly communicated to personnel. Specific strategies for accommodating the patient&#x2019;s needs must be identified in advance. Ensuring the security of assistive devices is important, because these devices are expensive and require time to replace if lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses in the preoperative area report that patients with mobility limitations have difficulty transferring from a standing position to the transport gurney and then, once on the gurney, to reposition themselves (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Link, 2018</a>). Therefore, the surgical team should incorporate a plan of care that ensures safe patient movement and handling. The patient with a disability that affects body position (e.g., cerebral palsy, postpolio syndrome, and other neuromuscular disorders) may need special positioning during surgery to prevent pain and injury. Patients with disability may be unable to sense painful positioning if their extremities are incorrectly adjusted, or they may be unable to communicate their discomfort. A comprehensive care plan should be developed preoperatively addressing the type of disability and patient specific needs.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with respiratory problems related to a disability (e.g., multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy) may experience difficulties unless the problems are made known to the anesthesiologist or CRNA and adjustments are made (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1223">Barash, Cullen, Stoelting, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). These factors need to be clearly identified in the preoperative period and communicated to the appropriate personnel.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s458">Patients Undergoing Ambulatory Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ambulatory surgery:&lt;/b&gt; includes outpatient, same-day, or short-stay surgery that does not require an overnight hospital stay">Ambulatory surgery</button></strong> includes outpatient, same-day, or short-stay surgery not requiring admission for an overnight hospital stay but may entail observation in a hospital setting for 23 hours or less. During the brief time the patient and family spend in the ambulatory setting, the nurse must quickly and comprehensively assess and anticipate the needs of the patient and at the same time begin planning for discharge and follow-up home care.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse needs to be sure that the patient and family understand that the patient will first go to the preoperative area before going to the OR for the surgical procedure and then will spend some time in the PACU before being discharged home with the family member later that day. Other preoperative education content should also be verified and reinforced as needed (see later discussion). The nurse should ensure that any plans for follow-up home care or new assistive devices are in place if needed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s459">Patients Undergoing Emergency Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Emergency surgeries are unplanned and occur with little time for preparation of the patient or the perioperative team. The unpredictable nature of trauma and emergency surgery poses unique challenges throughout the perioperative period. It is important for the nurse to communicate with the patient and team members as calmly and effectively as possible in these situations. (See <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> for the duties of the members of the perioperative team.)</p>
<p class="indent">Factors that affect patients preparing to undergo surgery also apply to patients undergoing emergency surgery, although usually in a very condensed time frame. The only <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page401" title="401"></span>opportunity for preoperative assessment may take place at the same time as resuscitation in the emergency department. A quick visual survey of the patient is essential to identify all sites of injury if the emergency surgery is due to trauma (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a> for more information). The patient, who may have undergone a traumatic experience, may need extra support and explanation of the surgery. For the patient who is unconscious, essential information, such as pertinent past medical history and allergies, need to be obtained from a family member, if one is available.</p>
