<h4 class="h4" id="s2349">Endocervicitis and Cervicitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endocervicitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the mucosa and the glands of the cervix">Endocervicitis</button></strong> is an inflammation of the mucosa and the glands of the cervix that may occur when organisms gain access to the cervical glands after penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse and, less often, after procedures such as abortion, intrauterine manipulation, or vaginal delivery. If untreated, the infection may extend into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and pelvic cavity. Inflammation can irritate the cervical tissue, resulting in spotting or bleeding and mucopurulent cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix with exudate).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2350">Chlamydia and Gonorrhea</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most common causes of endocervicitis, although <em>Mycoplasma</em> may also be involved. Chlamydia causes about 2.86 million infections every year in the United States; it is most commonly found in young people who are sexually active with more than one partner and is transmitted through sexual contact (CDC, 2016). Untreated chlamydia infections can spread to the fallopian tubes and uterus leading to serious complications including PID, an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, and infertility (CDC, 2016). Chlamydial infections of the cervix often produce no symptoms, but cervical discharge, dyspareunia, dysuria, and bleeding may occur. Other complications include conjunctivitis and perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh&#x2013;Curtis syndrome) (CDC, 2016). Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported STI, with over a million new infections each year (CDC, 2019). The inflamed cervix that results from infection may leave a woman more vulnerable to HIV transmission from an infected partner. Gonorrhea is often asymptomatic and a major cause of PID, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain (CDC, 2019). Diagnosis can be confirmed by urine culture or other methods such as using a swab to obtain a sample of cervical or penile discharge from the patient&#x2019;s partner (CDC, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2351">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The CDC recommends treating chlamydia with doxycycline for 1 week or with a single dose of azithromycin (CDC, 2016). Antimicrobial resistance to fluoroquinolones in the treatment of gonorrhea has left cephalosporins as the remaining recommended treatment (ACOG, 2018a; CDC, 2019). Dual therapy with azithromycin and ceftriaxone given simultaneously on the same day is the recommended first-line treatment for gonorrhea infection (ACOG, 2018a; CDC, 2019). Partners must also be treated. Women who are pregnant are cautioned not to take tetracycline because of potential adverse effects on the fetus. In these cases, erythromycin may be prescribed. Results are usually good if treatment begins early. Possible complications from delayed or no treatment are tubal disease, ectopic pregnancy, PID, and infertility.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultures for chlamydia and other STIs should be obtained from all patients who have been sexually assaulted when they first seek medical attention; patients are treated prophylactically. Cultures should then be repeated in 2 weeks. Annual screening for chlamydia is recommended for all young women who are sexually active and older women with new sex partners or multiple partners (CDC, 2016).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2352">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All women who are sexually active may be at risk for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other STIs, including HIV. Nurses can assist patients in assessing their own risk. Recognition of risk is a first step before changes in behavior occur. Patients should be discouraged from assuming that a partner is &#x201C;safe&#x201D; without open, honest discussion. Nonjudgmental attitudes, educational counseling, and role-playing may be helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">Because chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other STIs may have a serious effect on future health and fertility, and because many of these disorders can be prevented by the use of condoms and spermicides and careful choice of partners, nurses can play a major role in counseling patients about safer sex practices. Exploring options with patients, addressing knowledge deficits, and correcting misinformation may reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients should be advised to refer partners for evaluation and treatment. All women aged 25 and younger who are sexually active should be screened annually. Those older than 25 years should be screened if risk factors are present. Repeat testing should occur 3 months after treatment (CDC, 2016).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses can educate women and help them improve communication skills and initiate discussions about sex with their partners. Communicating with partners about sex, risk, postponing penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse, and using safer sex behaviors, including the use of condoms, may be lifesaving. Some young women report having sex but not being comfortable enough to discuss sexual risk issues. Nurses can help women to advocate for their own health by discussing safety with partners prior to sexual activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Reinforcing the need for annual screening for chlamydia and other STIs is an important part of patient education. Instructions also include the need for the patient to abstain from penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse until all her sex partners are treated (CDC, 2016).</p>
