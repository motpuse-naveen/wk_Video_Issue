<h4 class="h4" id="s1424">Low Back Pain</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Most low back pain is caused by one of many musculoskeletal problems, including acute lumbosacral strain, unstable lumbosacral ligaments and weak muscles, intervertebral disc problems, and unequal leg length. Depression, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and stress are frequent comorbidities (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2612">Ramanathan, Hibbert, Wiles, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Generally, back pain due to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1114" title="1114"></span>musculoskeletal disorders is aggravated by activity, whereas pain due to other conditions is not. Higher numbers of areas of pain are associated with a higher level of disability. Other nonmusculoskeletal causes of back pain, beyond the scope of this chapter, include kidney disorders, pelvic problems, retroperitoneal tumors, and abdominal aortic aneurysms.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1425"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older patients may experience back pain associated with osteoporotic vertebral fractures (see later discussion), osteoarthritis of the spine, and spinal stenosis. In addition, inactivity can have grave consequences on quality of life, progression of medical disease, energy level, and morbidity in older adults (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Simon &#x0026; Hicks, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1426">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The spinal column can be considered a rod constructed of rigid units (vertebrae) and flexible units (intervertebral discs) held together by complex facet joints, multiple ligaments, and paravertebral muscles. Its unique construction allows for flexibility while providing maximum protection for the spinal cord. The spinal curves absorb vertical shocks from running and jumping. The abdominal and thoracic muscles are important in lifting activities, working together to minimize stress on the spinal units. Disuse weakens these supporting muscular structures. Obesity, postural problems, structural problems, and overstretching of the spinal supports may result in back pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The intervertebral discs change in character as a person ages. A young person&#x2019;s discs are mainly fibrocartilage with a gelatinous matrix. Over time, the fibrocartilage becomes dense and irregularly shaped. Disc degeneration is a common cause of back pain. The lower lumbar discs, L4&#x2013;5 and L5&#x2013;S1, are subject to the greatest mechanical stress and the greatest degenerative changes. Disc protrusion or facet joint changes can cause pressure on nerve roots as they leave the spinal canal, which results in pain that radiates along the nerve (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). See <a href="c65.xhtml">Chapter 65</a> for discussion of the management of intervertebral disc disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1427">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The typical patient reports either acute back pain (lasting fewer than 3 months) or chronic back pain (3 months or longer without improvement) and fatigue. The patient may report pain radiating down the leg, which is known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;radiculopathy:&lt;/b&gt; disease of a spinal nerve root, often resulting in pain and extreme sensitivity to touch">radiculopathy</button></strong> (i.e., pain radiating from a diseased spinal nerve root) or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sciatica:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the sciatic nerve, resulting in pain and tenderness along the nerve through the thigh and leg">sciatica</button></strong> (i.e., pain radiating from an inflamed sciatic nerve); presence of this symptom suggests nerve root involvement. The patient&#x2019;s gait, spinal mobility, reflexes, leg length, leg motor strength, and sensory perception may be affected. Physical examination may disclose paravertebral muscle spasm (greatly increased muscle tone of the back postural muscles) with a loss of the normal lumbar curve and possible spinal deformity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1428">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The initial evaluation of acute low back pain includes a focused history and physical examination, including observation of the patient, gait evaluation, and neurologic testing (see <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a>). The findings suggest either nonspecific lumbar strain or potentially serious problems, such as a spinal fracture, cancer, infection, or rapidly progressing neurologic deficits. The presence of bruising, older age, and prolonged use of corticosteroid medications increases the risk of a fracture posttraumatic injury (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Gironda, Nguyen, &#x0026; Mosqueda, 2016</a>). In addition, the nurse should be alert to the potential for older adult abuse.</p>
<p class="indent">Another potential cause of low back pain is <em>cauda equina syndrome,</em> which results from compression of the cauda equina, the bundle of spinal nerves that arise from the lower portion of the spinal cord. When these nerves become compressed, the patient will have signs and symptoms that include severe or progressive neurologic deficit, recent bowel or bladder dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia which is characterized by paresthesias in the perineal, inner thigh, or buttock region that may be asymmetrical (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2606">Qaseem, Wilt, McLean, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Cauda equina syndrome is a medical emergency requiring immediate referral to an emergency department so that the patient may receive expeditious treatment to relieve the underlying cause before nerve damage occurs (e.g., treatment can consist of surgical removal of vertebral fragments, decompression of a tumor mass).</p>
<p class="indent">The diagnostic procedures described in <a href="#ct36-1">Chart 36-1</a> may be indicated for the patient with potentially serious or prolonged low back pain. Red flags that trigger prescribing these studies include suspected spinal infection, severe neurologic weakness, urinary or fecal incontinence, and a new onset of back pain in a patient with cancer (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2606">Qaseem et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The nurse prepares the patient for these studies, provides the necessary support during the testing period, and monitors the patient for any adverse responses to the procedures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1429">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most back pain is self-limited and resolves within 4 to 6 weeks with analgesics, rest, and avoidance of strain. Based on initial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1115" title="1115"></span>assessment findings indicating nonspecific back symptoms, the patient is reassured that the pain is not due to a serious condition and x-rays or other imaging modalities are not necessary (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2606">Qaseem et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Management focuses on relief of discomfort, activity modification, and patient education. The presence of other medical problems and fear of pain complicates the picture and has higher cost, less favorable outcomes, and more long-term disability (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2580">Karasawa, Yamadada, Iseki, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Nonprescription analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and short-term prescription muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine) are effective in relieving acute low back pain, but no one medication is considered superior to another (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2595">Michigan Quality Improvement Consortium [MQIC], 2018</a>). Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and the dual-action serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine) or atypical anticonvulsant medications (e.g., gabapentin, which is prescribed for pain from radiculopathy) are used effectively in chronic low back pain. Opioid medications are indicated only short term (1 to 2 weeks) for acute moderate to severe cases of low back pain, except in older adults, those with kidney disease, or those who must avoid chronic NSAID exposure because of its adverse gastric effects. Systemic corticosteroids and acetaminophen are not effective in fully alleviating acute low back pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2583">Krebs, Gravely, Nugent, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). For chronic pain, a reduction of pain by 30% less than baseline is the goal (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Dupuis &#x0026; Duff, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Effective nonpharmacologic interventions include thermal applications (hot or cold) and spinal manipulation (e.g., chiropractic therapy). Lumbar support belts are not recommended to treat acute low back pain but may be marginally effective devices for preventing low back pain in occupational health settings (MQIC, 2018). Orthopedic shoe inserts are not recommended for prevention but may help correct an underlying issue contributing to the problem (e.g., unequal leg length). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (e.g., biofeedback), exercise regimens, spinal manipulation, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage, and yoga are all effective nonpharmacologic interventions for treating chronic low back pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2606">Qaseem et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients need to alter their activity patterns to avoid aggravating the pain. They should avoid twisting, bending, lifting, and reaching&#x2014;all of which stress the back. The patient is taught to change position frequently. Sitting should be limited to 20 to 50 minutes based on level of comfort. Absolute bed rest is no longer recommended; typical activities of daily living (ADLs) should be resumed as soon as possible. A quick return to normal activities and a program of low-stress aerobic exercise are recommended (MQIC, 2018). Conditioning exercises for both back and trunk muscles are begun after about 2 weeks to help prevent recurrence of pain. Active motion activities such as walking have a beneficial impact on outcomes (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Dupuis &#x0026; Duff, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1430">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse asks the patient to describe the discomfort (e.g., location, severity, duration, characteristics, radiation, and weakness in the legs). Descriptions of how the pain occurred, such as with a specific action (e.g., opening a garage door) or with an activity in which weak muscles were overused (e.g., weekend gardening), and how the patient has dealt with the pain often suggest areas for intervention and patient education.</p>
<p class="indent">If back pain is a recurring problem, assessment about previous successful pain control methods helps in planning current management. Information about work and recreational activities helps identify areas for back health education. Because stress and anxiety can evoke muscle spasms and pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2571">Feinstein, Khalsa, Yeh, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>), the nurse assesses environmental variables, work situations, and family relationships. In addition, the nurse assesses the effect of chronic pain on the emotional well-being of the patient. Referral to a mental health professional for assessment and management of stressors contributing to the low back pain and related depression may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">During the interview, the nurse observes the patient&#x2019;s posture, position changes, and gait. Often, the patient&#x2019;s movements are guarded, with the back kept as still as possible. The patient should be directed to a chair of standard seat height with arms for support. The patient may sit and stand in an unusual position, leaning away from the most painful side, and may need assistance when undressing for the physical examination.</p>
<p class="indent">On physical examination, the nurse assesses the spinal curve, any leg length discrepancy, and pelvic crest and shoulder symmetry. The nurse palpates the paraspinal muscles and notes spasm and tenderness. When the patient is in a prone position, the paraspinal muscles relax and any deformity caused by spasm can subside. The nurse asks the patient to bend forward and then laterally, noting any discomfort or limitations in movement. It is important to determine the effect of these limitations on ADLs. The nurse evaluates nerve involvement by assessing deep tendon reflexes, sensations (e.g., paresthesia), and muscle strength. Back and leg pain on straight-leg raising (with the patient supine, the patient&#x2019;s leg is lifted upward with the knee extended) suggests nerve root involvement.</p>
<p class="indent">The major nursing goals for patient management include relief of pain, improved physical mobility, the use of back-conserving techniques of body mechanics, improved self-esteem, and weight reduction (as necessary) (see <a href="#ct36-2">Chart 36-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s response to analgesic agents. As the acute pain subsides, medication dosages are reduced. The nurse evaluates and notes the patient&#x2019;s response to various pain management modalities (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). The nurse cautions the patient with severe pain not to remain on bed rest because extended periods of inactivity are not effective and result in deconditioning. A medium to firm, nonsagging mattress (a bed board may be used) is recommended; there is no evidence to support the use of a firm mattress (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2608">Radwan, Fess, James, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Lumbar flexion is increased by elevating the head and thorax 30 degrees by using pillows or a foam wedge and slightly flexing the knees supported on a pillow. Alternatively, the patient can assume a lateral position with knees and hips flexed (curled position) with a pillow between the knees and legs and a pillow supporting the head (see <a href="#ff36-1">Fig. 36-1</a>). A prone position should be avoided because it accentuates lordosis. The nurse instructs the patient to get out of bed by rolling to one side and placing the legs down while pushing the torso up, keeping the back straight.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">As the patient achieves comfort, an exercise program is gradually initiated with low-stress aerobic exercises, such as short walks or swimming. The physical therapist designs an exercise program for the patient to reduce lordosis, increase flexibility, and reduce strain on the back. It may include hyperextension exercises to strengthen the paravertebral muscles, flexion exercises to increase back movement and strength, and isometric flexion exercises to strengthen trunk muscles. Each 30-minute daily exercise period begins and ends with muscle stretching and relaxation.</p>

Photo by B. Proud.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The nurse encourages the patient to adhere to the prescribed exercise program. Some patients may find it difficult to do so for a long period. In these instances, alternating activities may help facilitate adherence to the regimen. Activities should not cause excessive lumbar strain or twisting, with avoidance of activities such as horseback riding and weight lifting.</p>
<p class="indent">Good body mechanics and posture are essential to avoid recurrence of back pain. The patient must be taught how to stand, sit, lie, and lift properly (see <a href="#ff36-2">Fig. 36-2</a>). Providing the patient with a list of suggestions helps in making these long-term changes (see <a href="#ct36-2">Chart 36-2</a>). The patient who wears high heels is encouraged to change to low heels with good arch support. The patient who is required to stand for long periods should shift weight frequently and rest one foot on a low stool, which decreases lumbar lordosis. Standing on a foot cushion made of foam or rubber can be helpful. The proper posture can be verified by looking in a mirror to see whether the chest is up, the abdomen is tucked in, and the shoulders are down and relaxed. Locking the knees when standing is avoided as well as bending forward for long periods.</p>

(<strong><em>Right</em></strong>) Incorrect position for lifting.

<p class="indent">When sitting, the knees and hips should be flexed, with the knees in level with the hips or higher to minimize lordosis. The feet should be flat on the floor or supported on a raised surface. Patients should avoid sitting on stools or chairs that do not provide firm back support.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse instructs the patient in the safe and correct way to lift objects&#x2014;using the strong quadriceps muscles of the thighs, with minimal use of weak back muscles (see <a href="#ff36-3">Fig. 36-3</a>). With feet placed hip-width apart to provide a wide base of support, the patient should bend the knees, tighten the abdominal muscles, and lift the object close to the body with a smooth motion, avoiding twisting and jarring motions. The patient should avoid lifting more than one third of their ideal weight without help to prevent injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Role-related responsibilities may have to be modified with the onset of low back pain (e.g., carrying children). As recovery progresses, the patient may resume them. However, if these activities contributed to the development of low back pain, resuming them may lead to the development of chronic low back pain, with associated disability. If the patient experiences secondary gains associated with low back disability (e.g., workers&#x2019; compensation, easier lifestyle or workload, increased emotional support), there is a risk that the patient will not fully resume work and family roles. Earlier return to work and lifestyle, even at a reduced level, have better outcomes than waiting for full recovery (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2606">Qaseem et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Antidepressants and counseling may be needed to assist the person in resuming a full, productive life. Specialized back clinics use multidisciplinary approaches to help the patient with chronic pain resume role-related responsibilities; these approaches are especially beneficial for patients who experience fear and depression associated with chronic pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2580">Karasawa et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="nonindent"><img class="drop" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt="icon" /> Obesity contributes to back strain by overtaxing the relatively weak back muscles in the absence of abdominal muscle support. Exercises are less effective and more difficult to perform when the patient is overweight. Weight reduction through diet modification is important to minimize recurrence of back pain. A sound nutritional plan that includes a change in eating habits and low-impact activities is vital. Noting achievement of weight reduction and providing positive reinforcement facilitate adherence. Back problems may or may not fully resolve as optimal weight is achieved (MQIC, 2018).</p>
