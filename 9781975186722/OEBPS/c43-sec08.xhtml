<h4 class="h4" id="s1813">Esophageal Varices</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Esophageal varices are present in 30% of patients with compensated cirrhosis and 60% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>) (see Clinical Manifestations in the Hepatic Cirrhosis section for further discussion). Varices are varicosities that develop from elevated pressure in the veins that drain into the portal system. They are prone to rupture and often are the source of massive hemorrhages from the upper GI tract and the rectum. In addition, abnormalities in blood clotting, often seen in patients with severe liver disease, increase the likelihood of bleeding with significant blood loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Once esophageal varices form, they increase in size over time and may eventually bleed (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). In cirrhosis, varices are the most significant source of bleeding. The first bleeding episode has a mortality rate of 10% to 30% depending on the severity of the liver disease and is one of the major causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. Overall mortality associated with acute variceal bleeding ranges from 10% to 40%. The mortality rate is related to failure to control a bleeding episode and the occurrence of early rebleeding (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Patients surviving the first episode of variceal bleeding are at very high risk for recurrent bleeding (approximately 70%) and death (30% to 50%) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1814">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Esophageal varices are dilated, tortuous veins that are usually found in the submucosa of the lower esophagus but may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1376" title="1376"></span>develop higher in the esophagus or extend into the stomach. This condition is almost always caused by portal hypertension, which results from obstruction of the portal venous circulation within the damaged liver.</p>

<p class="indent">Because of increased obstruction of the portal vein, venous blood from the intestinal tract and spleen seeks an outlet through collateral circulation (new pathways for return of blood to the right atrium). The effect is increased pressure, particularly in the vessels in the submucosal layer of the lower esophagus and upper part of the stomach. These collateral vessels are not very elastic; rather, they are tortuous and fragile, and they bleed easily (see <a href="#ff43-8">Fig. 43-8</a>). Less common causes of varices are abnormalities of the circulation in the splenic vein or superior vena cava and hepatic venothrombosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Bleeding esophageal varices are life-threatening and can result in hemorrhagic shock that produces decreased cerebral, hepatic, and renal perfusion. In turn, there is an increased nitrogen load from bleeding into the GI tract and an increased serum ammonia level, increasing the risk of encephalopathy. Usually, the dilated veins cause no symptoms. However, if the portal pressure increases sharply and the mucosa or supporting structures become thin, massive hemorrhaging occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors that contribute to hemorrhage are muscular exertion from lifting heavy objects; straining at stool; sneezing, coughing, or vomiting; esophagitis; irritation of vessels by poorly chewed foods or irritating fluids; and reflux of stomach contents (especially alcohol). Salicylates and any medication that erodes the esophageal mucosa or interferes with cell replication also may contribute to bleeding.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1815">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with bleeding esophageal varices may present with hematemesis, melena, or general deterioration in mental or physical status and often has a history of alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms of shock (cool clammy skin, hypotension, tachycardia) may be present (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1816">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Endoscopy is used to identify the bleeding site, along with ultrasonography, CT scanning, and angiography. Another diagnostic tool, the endoscopic video capsule, can detect esophageal varices but does not substitute for endoscopy unless this test cannot be performed. Standard endoscopy is superior to video capsule for the diagnosis of esophageal varices (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Because varices are present in 50% of patients with cirrhosis, it is recommended that patients who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis undergo screening endoscopy. If no varices are detected on initial endoscopy, the test should be repeated in 2 to 3 years in an effort to identify and treat large varices, which are the ones most likely to bleed. If small varices are identified on initial endoscopy, the test should be repeated in 1 to 2 years (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate endoscopy (see <a href="c38.xhtml">Chapter 38</a>) is indicated to identify the cause and the site of bleeding; approximately 40% of patients with suspected bleeding from esophageal varices are actually bleeding from another source (gastritis, ulcer) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3308">Simonetto et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Nursing support is essential during this often stressful experience. Careful monitoring can detect early signs of cardiac arrhythmias, perforation, and hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="indent">After the examination, fluids are not given until the patient&#x2019;s gag reflex returns. Lozenges and gargles may be used to relieve throat discomfort if the patient&#x2019;s physical condition and mental status permit. If the patient is actively bleeding, oral intake will not be permitted, and the patient will be prepared for further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Portal Hypertension Measurements</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Portal hypertension may be suspected if dilated abdominal veins and hemorrhoids are detected. Splenomegaly and ascites may also be present. Portal venous pressure can be measured directly or indirectly. Indirect measurement of the hepatic vein pressure gradient is the most common procedure. The measurement requires insertion of a catheter with a balloon into the antecubital or femoral vein. The catheter is advanced under fluoroscopy to a hepatic vein. Fluid is infused once the catheter is in position to inflate the balloon. A &#x201C;wedged&#x201D; pressure (similar to pulmonary artery wedge pressure) is obtained by occluding the blood flow in the blood vessel; pressure in the unoccluded vessel is also measured and the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is obtained. An HVPG of over 10 mm Hg is indicative of clinically significant portal hypertension (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>). Although the values obtained may underestimate portal pressure, this measurement may be taken several times to evaluate the results of therapy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Direct measurement of portal vein pressure can be obtained by several methods. One direct measurement requires insertion of a catheter into the portal vein or one of its branches (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). Endoscopic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1377" title="1377"></span>measurement of pressure within varices is used only in conjunction with endoscopic sclerotherapy (see later discussion).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Laboratory Tests</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Laboratory studies may include various liver function tests, such as serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum proteins. Splenoportography, which involves serial or segmental x-rays, is used to detect extensive collateral circulation in esophageal vessels, which would indicate varices. Other tests are hepatoportography and celiac angiography. These are usually performed in the operating room or x-ray department.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1817"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bleeding from esophageal varices is an emergency that can quickly lead to hemorrhagic shock. The patient is critically ill, requiring aggressive medical care and expert nursing care, and is usually transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for a discussion of care of the patient in shock. The extent of bleeding is evaluated, and vital signs are monitored continuously if hematemesis and melena are present.</p>
<p class="indent">Because patients with bleeding esophageal varices have intravascular volume depletion and are subject to electrolyte imbalance, IV fluids, electrolytes, and volume expanders are provided to restore fluid volume and replace electrolytes. Transfusion of blood components also may be required.</p>
<p class="indent">Caution must be taken with volume resuscitation so that overhydration does not occur, because this would raise portal pressure and increase bleeding. An indwelling urinary catheter is usually inserted to permit frequent monitoring of urine output.</p>
<p class="indent">Although a variety of pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical approaches are used to treat bleeding esophageal varices, none is ideal, and most are associated with considerable risk to the patient. Nonsurgical treatment of bleeding esophageal varices is preferable because of the high mortality rate of emergency surgery to control bleeding esophageal varices and because of the poor physical condition that is typical of the patient with severe liver dysfunction.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In suspected variceal bleeding, vasoactive drugs such as octreotide or vasopressin need to be given as soon as possible and before endoscopy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). In a patient who is actively bleeding, medications are given initially because they can be obtained and given more quickly than other therapies. Octreotide, a synthetic analog of the hormone somatostatin, is effective in decreasing bleeding from esophageal varices, and lacks the vasoconstrictive effects of vasopressin. Because of this safety and efficacy profile, octreotide is considered the preferred treatment regimen for immediate control of variceal bleeding. These medications cause selective splanchnic vasoconstriction by inhibiting glucagon release and are used mainly in the management of active hemorrhage. Adverse effects are rare with octreotide but mild hypoglycemia and abdominal cramping can occur (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Vasopressin may be the initial mode of therapy in urgent situations because it produces constriction of the splanchnic arterial bed and decreases portal pressure. As described previously, splanchnic circulation comprises the arterial blood supply and venous drainage of the entire GI tract from the distal esophagus to the midrectum, including the liver and spleen. Vasopressin constricts distal esophageal and proximal gastric veins, thus reducing the inflow into the portal system and therefore the portal pressure. Vital signs and the presence or absence of blood in the gastric aspirate indicate the effectiveness of vasopressin. Monitoring of I&#x0026;O and electrolyte levels is necessary because hyponatremia may develop, and vasopressin may have an antidiuretic effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Coronary artery disease is a contraindication to the use of vasopressin because coronary vasoconstriction is a side effect that may precipitate myocardial infarction. The combination of vasopressin with nitroglycerin (given by the IV, sublingual, or transdermal route) has been effective in reducing or preventing the side effects (constriction of coronary vessels and angina) caused by vasopressin alone. Side effects of vasopressin include myocardial and extremity ischemia as well as cardiac arrhythmias; therefore, vasopressin is used only in urgent situations or when other agents such as octreotide are not available. Vasopressin must be given with close monitoring (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Beta-blocking agents such as propranolol, nadolol, or carvedilol that decrease portal pressure are the most common medications used both to prevent a first bleeding episode in patients with known varices and to prevent rebleeding (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Bunchorntavakul &#x0026; Reddy, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Beta-blockers have been shown to effectively reduce the risk of variceal bleeding and its associated mortality. Beta-blockers should not be used in acute variceal hemorrhage, but they are effective prophylaxis against initial and recurrent bleeding episodes (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Bunchorntavakul &#x0026; Reddy, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Nitrates such as isosorbide lower portal pressure by venodilation and decreased cardiac output and may be used in combination with beta-blockers to reduce the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Bunchorntavakul &#x0026; Reddy, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17a.png" alt=""/> Balloon Tamponade</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although used infrequently today, balloon tamponade therapy may be used to temporarily control hemorrhage and to stabilize a patient with massive bleeding prior to other definitive management (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). This procedure involves the insertion of a tube from the nose into the stomach. This tube has two inflatable balloons, one esophageal and one gastric. When inflated from a port external to the patient, these balloons compress bleeding varices in the stomach or esophagus to inhibit bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">When indicated, balloon tamponade can be successful; however, there are risks. Displacement of the tube and the inflated balloon into the oropharynx can cause life-threatening obstruction of the airway and asphyxiation. This may occur if the patient pulls on the tube because of confusion or discomfort. It may also result from rupture of the gastric balloon, which causes the esophageal balloon to move into the oropharynx. Sudden rupture of the balloon causes airway obstruction and aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. Therefore, the tube must be tested before insertion to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1378" title="1378"></span>minimize this risk by ensuring that the balloons can attain and maintain inflation. Aspiration of blood and secretions into the lungs is frequently associated with balloon tamponade, especially in the stuporous or comatose patient. Endotracheal intubation before insertion of the tube protects the airway and minimizes the risk of aspiration. Ulceration and necrosis of the nose, the mucosa of the stomach, or the esophagus may occur if the tube is left in place too long, inflated too long, or inflated at too high a pressure. The therapy is used for as short a time as possible to control bleeding while emergency treatment is completed and definitive therapies are instituted (no longer than 12 hours, preferably less) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The patient being treated with balloon tamponade must remain under close observation in the ICU and must be monitored continuously because of the risk of serious complications such as aspiration, esophageal ulcer formation, and perforation. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the patient does not pull on or inadvertently displace the tube.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Nursing measures include frequent mouth and nasal care. For secretions that accumulate in the mouth, tissues should be within easy reach of the patient. Oral suction may be necessary to remove secretions.</p>
<p class="indent">Although balloon tamponade stops the bleeding in 90% of patients, bleeding recurs in 60% to 70%, necessitating other treatment modalities, such as endoscopic therapies (see later discussion). Once the balloons are deflated or the tube is removed, the patient must be assessed frequently because of the high risk of recurrent bleeding (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Endoscopic Sclerotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In endoscopic <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sclerotherapy:&lt;/b&gt; the injection of substances into or around esophagogastric varices to cause constriction, thickening, and hardening of the vessel and stop bleeding">sclerotherapy</button></strong> (see <a href="#ff43-9">Fig. 43-9</a>), also referred to as injection sclerotherapy, a sclerosing agent (i.e., sodium morrhuate, ethanolamine oleate, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or ethanol) is injected through a fiberoptic endoscope into or adjacent to the bleeding esophageal varices to promote thrombosis and eventual sclerosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>). The process of sclerotherapy causes inflammation of the involved vein with eventual thrombosis and loss of the lumen of the vessel. The procedure has been used successfully to treat acute GI hemorrhage but is not recommended for prevention of first and subsequent variceal bleeding episodes where <strong>endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)</strong>, also known as esophageal banding therapy (discussed later), is the first-line treatment (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">After treatment for acute hemorrhage, the patient must be observed for bleeding, perforation of the esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, and esophageal stricture. Antacids, histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) antagonists such as cimetidine, or proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole may be given after the procedure to counteract the chemical effects of the sclerosing agent on the esophagus and the acid reflux associated with the therapy.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Endoscopic Variceal Ligation (Esophageal Banding Therapy)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In EVL (see <a href="#ff43-10">Fig. 43-10</a>), also referred to as variceal banding, a modified endoscope loaded with an elastic rubber band is passed through an overtube directly onto the varix (or varices) to be banded. After the bleeding varix is suctioned into the tip of the endoscope, the rubber band is slipped over the tissue, causing necrosis, ulceration, and eventual sloughing of the varix.</p>

<p class="indent">An EVL procedure is effective in controlling acute bleeding. Compared with sclerotherapy, EVL also significantly reduces the rebleeding rate, mortality, procedure-related complications, as well as number of sessions needed to eradicate varices and thus has replaced sclerotherapy as the treatment of choice in the management of esophageal varices (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Potential complications include superficial ulceration and dysphagia, transient chest discomfort, and, rarely, esophageal strictures. An EVL procedure in combination with pharmacologic therapy may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1379" title="1379"></span>be more effective than monotherapy (i.e., a single mode of therapy) in the treatment of acute hemorrhage. EVL is also recommended for patients who have experienced variceal bleeding while receiving beta-blocker therapy and for those who cannot tolerate beta-blocking agents (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A TIPS procedure (see <a href="#ff43-9">Fig. 43-9</a>) is indicated for the treatment of an acute episode of uncontrolled variceal bleeding refractory to pharmacologic or endoscopic therapy. In 10% to 20% of patients for whom urgent band ligation or sclerotherapy and medications are not successful in eradicating bleeding, a TIPS procedure can effectively control acute variceal hemorrhage by rapidly lowering portal pressure. Polytetrafluoroethylene-covered TIPS placement should be considered in high-risk patients with cirrhosis and active bleeding at the time of endoscopy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Potential complications of TIPS include bleeding, sepsis, heart failure, organ perforation, shunt thrombosis, and progressive liver failure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Additional Therapies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The use of endoscopically placed tissue adhesives and fibrin glue has been successful in the treatment of gastric and esophageal varices. Coated expandable stents (placed via endoscope) have also been used effectively for the same purpose (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Portosystemic shunting into lower resistance vessels (those vessels not affected by the high pressure in the portal system) and the end-organ collateral variceal formation that results in bleeding may also be treated by a variety of embolization procedures, including balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3305">Philips, Rajesh, Augustine, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1818">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several surgical procedures have been developed to treat esophageal varices and to minimize rebleeding, but these procedures have significant risk. Procedures that may be used for esophageal varices are direct surgical ligation of varices; splenorenal, mesocaval, and portacaval venous shunts to relieve portal pressure; and esophageal transection with devascularization. These procedures are rarely used and remain controversial, as studies regarding their effectiveness and outcomes continue. What is known is that these procedures are very effective in controlling variceal bleeding. They may be considered as second-line management (rescue therapy) in those patients for whom all other treatments have failed, those who are not candidates for liver transplantation, and those who require a bridge to transplantation. There is a high incidence of encephalopathy after the surgical shunting procedures, and morbidity and mortality statistics remain high (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Philips et al., 2019</a>). The TIPS procedure has largely replaced the use of surgical decompression shunts and ligation procedures but these interventions may still be used in some cases to manage esophageal varices.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Bypass Procedures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical decompression (shunt surgery) of the portal circulation may be used with the advent of a variceal bleeding episode. Although effective in eradicating bleeding, survival statistics and encephalopathy are worse than other preventative measures such as a TIPS procedure when this method is employed for prophylaxis, and shunt surgery for this purpose has largely been abandoned worldwide (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Kovacs &#x0026; Jensen, 2019</a>). The current recommendation is that surgical shunts be considered only in patients who have Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores of &#x003C;15, who are not candidates for hepatic transplantation, or who have limited access to TIPS therapy and needed follow-up. (See later discussion of MELD classification in Liver Transplantation section.)</p>
<p class="indent">An aim of a surgical shunt is to reduce portal venous pressure (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Brunicardi, 2019</a>). One surgical shunting procedure (see <a href="#ff43-11">Fig. 43-11</a>) is the distal splenorenal shunt, which is made between the splenic vein and the left renal vein after splenectomy. A mesocaval shunt is created by anastomosing the superior mesenteric vein to the proximal end of the vena cava or to the side of the vena cava using grafting material. The goal of distal splenorenal and mesocaval shunts is to decrease portal pressure by draining only a portion of venous blood from the portal bed; therefore, they are considered selective shunts. The liver continues to receive some portal flow, and the incidence of encephalopathy may be reduced. Portacaval shunts are considered nonselective shunts because they divert all portal flow to the vena cava via end-to-side or side-to-side approaches.</p>
<p class="indent">These procedures are extensive and are not always successful because of secondary thrombosis in the veins used for the shunt and because of complications (e.g., encephalopathy, accelerated liver failure). The effectiveness of these procedures has been studied extensively. All shunt procedures are equally effective in preventing recurrent variceal bleeding but may cause further impairment of liver function and encephalopathy. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1380" title="1380"></span>Partial portacaval shunts with interposition grafts are as effective as other shunts but are associated with a lower rate of encephalopathy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). The severity of the disease (by a classification such as the Child&#x2013;Pugh system, discussed later) and the potential for future liver transplantation guide the treatment decision. If the cause of portal hypertension is the rare Budd&#x2013;Chiari syndrome (which is manifested by noncirrhotic portal hypertension caused by hepatic vein thrombosis) or other venous obstructive disease, a portacaval or a mesoatrial shunt may be performed (see Fig.&#x00A0;43-11). The mesoatrial shunt is required when the infrahepatic vena cava is thrombosed and must be bypassed.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Devascularization and Transection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Devascularization and staple-gun transection procedures to separate the bleeding site from the high-pressure portal system have been used in the emergency management of variceal bleeding. The lower end of the esophagus is reached through a small gastrostomy incision; a staple gun permits anastomosis of the transected ends of the esophagus. Rebleeding is a risk, and the outcomes of these procedures vary among patient populations.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The surgical procedures used to treat esophageal varices do not alter the course of the progressive liver disease, and bleeding may recur as new collateral vessels develop. The risk of complications (hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic and respiratory alkalosis, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and seizures) is high.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1819">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing assessment includes monitoring the patient&#x2019;s physical condition and evaluating emotional responses and cognitive status. The nurse monitors and records vital signs and assesses the patient&#x2019;s nutritional and neurologic status. This assessment assists in identifying hepatic encephalopathy (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">If complete rest of the esophagus is indicated because of bleeding, parenteral nutrition is initiated. Gastric suction usually is initiated to keep the stomach as empty as possible and to prevent straining and vomiting. The patient often complains of severe thirst, which may be relieved by frequent oral hygiene and moist sponges to the lips. The nurse closely monitors the blood pressure. Vitamin K therapy and multiple blood transfusions often are indicated because of blood loss. A quiet environment and calm reassurance may help to relieve the patient&#x2019;s anxiety and reduce agitation.</p>
<p class="indent">Bleeding anywhere in the body is anxiety provoking, resulting in a crisis for the patient and family. If the patient has been a heavy user of alcohol, delirium secondary to alcohol withdrawal can complicate the situation. The nurse provides support and explanations about medical and nursing interventions to prepare both the patient and the family, because these procedures can be difficult to undergo and observe. Close monitoring of the patient helps in detecting and managing complications. Management modalities and nursing care of the patient with bleeding esophageal varices are summarized in <a href="#tt43-2">Table 43-2</a>.</p>
