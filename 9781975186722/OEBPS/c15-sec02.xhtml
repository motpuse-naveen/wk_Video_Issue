<h4 class="h4" id="s493">Safety and Infection Prevention</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Within the OR, many factors prevent the spread of microorganisms that may cause surgical site infections (SSIs). These <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page421" title="421"></span>factors involve a combination of facility structure and personnel practices, which are regulated by professional guidelines and overseen by facility members.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s494">The Surgical Environment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The surgical suite is behind double doors, and access is limited to authorized, appropriately clad personnel. The OR is considered a restricted area where careful attention to infection prevention is at the highest standard. In the OR environment, microbial contamination can occur through an airborne or contact route; as a result, the OR has special air filtration devices to screen out contaminating particles, dust, and pollutants. ORs are designed with laminar flow ventilation to circulate particles away from the patient and surgical field. Personnel also follow strict aseptic practices, including hand scrubbing, machine and room cleaning, sterile supply and instrumentation use, and limited movement. Reducing traffic and door openings has been linked to maintaining optimal airflow with minimal circulating particles and contaminants (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Armellino, 2017</a>). Policies governing this environment address such issues as the health of the staff; the cleanliness of the rooms; the sterility of equipment and surfaces; processes for scrubbing, gowning, and gloving; and OR attire (AORN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">The surgical environment is known for its stark appearance and cool temperature. Therefore, it is important to maintain patient normothermia. Research supports warming the patient starting in the preoperative area, and throughout all perioperative phases of care. Examples of intraoperative warming techniques are raising room temperature, using forced-air warming blankets, and administering warmed irrigation and IV solutions (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Phillips, 2017</a>; <a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1292">Williams, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To provide the best possible conditions for surgery, the OR is situated in a location that is central to all supporting services (e.g., pathology, x-ray, and laboratory).</p>
<p class="indent">Many National Patient Safety Goals pertain to the perioperative areas (see <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <a href="c14-sec10.xhtml#ct14-7">Chart&#x00A0;14-7</a>); however, the one with the most direct relevance to the OR is to identify patient safety risks. A unique risk is the risk of fire in the OR due to three factors: a source of fuel, an oxygen source, and a mechanism to ignite a fire (AORN, 2019b; ASPAN, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s495">Prevention of OR Fires</h5>
<p class="nonindent">AORN recommends the use of the Fire Risk Assessment Tool to assess the dangers of fires for each surgical case (see <a href="#ff15-2">Fig.&#x00A0;15-2</a>). The fire risk is discussed during the surgical time-out, and an indication of whether or not the patient has a fire risk is placed on the team communication board in the OR. A regulatory requirement endorsed by The Joint Commission is that every OR perform an annual fire drill to ensure staff familiarity with evacuation plans and to test facility safeguards in the event of a fire (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1283">Joint Commission, 2019</a>). To further improve safety, electrical hazards, emergency exit clearances, and storage of equipment and anesthetic gases are monitored periodically by official agencies, such as the respective state Department of Health and The Joint Commission.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s496">Surgical Attire</h5>
<p class="nonindent">To help decrease microbes, the surgical area is divided into three zones: the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;unrestricted zone:&lt;/b&gt; area in the operating room that interfaces with other departments; includes patient reception area and holding area">unrestricted zone</button></strong>, where street clothes are allowed; the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;semirestricted zone:&lt;/b&gt; area in the operating room where scrub attire is required; may include areas where surgical instruments are processed">semirestricted zone</button></strong>, where attire consists of scrub clothes and caps; and the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;restricted zone:&lt;/b&gt; area in the operating room where scrub attire and surgical masks are required; includes operating room and sterile core areas">restricted zone</button></strong>, where scrub clothes, shoe covers, caps, and masks are worn. The surgeons and other surgical team members wear additional sterile clothing and protective devices during surgery.</p>

<p class="indent">The AORN recommends specific practices for personnel wearing surgical attire to promote a high level of cleanliness in a particular practice setting (AORN, 2019a). OR attire includes close-fitting cotton scrub shirts and pants, gowns, and jackets. Knitted cuffs on sleeves prevent organisms from shedding and being released into the immediate surroundings. Shirts and waist drawstrings should be tucked inside the pants to prevent accidental contact with sterile areas and to contain skin shedding. Wet or soiled garments should be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">Masks are worn at all times in the restricted zone of the OR. High-filtration masks decrease the risk of postoperative wound infection by containing and filtering microorganisms from the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Masks should fit tightly; should cover the nose and mouth completely; and should not interfere with breathing, speech, or vision. Masks must be adjusted to prevent venting from the sides. Disposable masks have a filtration efficiency exceeding 95%. Masks are changed between patients and should not be worn outside the surgical department. The mask must be either on or off; it must not be allowed to hang around the neck.</p>
<p class="indent">Headgear should completely cover the hair (head and neckline, including beard) so that hair, bobby pins, clips, and particles of dandruff or dust do not fall on the sterile field.</p>
<p class="indent">Shoes designated for use inside the OR (not worn home) should be comfortable and supportive. Shoe covers are used <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page422" title="422"></span>when spills or splashes are anticipated. If worn, the covers should be changed whenever they become wet, torn, or soiled (AORN 2019a; Rothrock, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Barriers such as scrub attire and masks do not entirely protect the patient from microorganisms. Upper respiratory tract infections, sore throats, and skin infections in staff and patients are sources of pathogens and must be reported.</p>
<p class="indent">Because artificial fingernails harbor microorganisms and can cause nosocomial infections, a ban on artificial nails by OR personnel is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), AORN, and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC). Research provides support for policies prohibiting artificial nails for health care workers (AORN, 2019a). Short, natural fingernails are encouraged.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s497">Principles of Surgical Asepsis and Sterile Technique</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;surgical asepsis:&lt;/b&gt; absence of microorganisms in the surgical environment to reduce the risk of infection">Surgical asepsis</button></strong> prevents the contamination of surgical wounds. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sterile technique:&lt;/b&gt; measures taken to maintain an area free from living microorganisms, including all spores">Sterile technique</button></strong> implies that the area is free of living microorganisms. The patient&#x2019;s natural skin flora or a previously existing infection may cause postoperative SSI. Rigorous adherence to the principles of sterility by OR personnel is basic to preventing SSIs.</p>
<p class="indent">All surgical supplies, instruments, needles, sutures, dressings, gloves, covers, and solutions that may come in contact with the surgical wound or exposed tissues must be sterilized before use (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). The surgeon, surgical assistants, scrub personnel, and nurses prepare themselves by scrubbing their hands and arms with antiseptic soap and water or alcohol-based (waterless) product. OR personnel must follow the product manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations in order to achieve hand antisepsis (AORN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">The skin of patients, OR team members, and visitors constitutes a microbiologic hazard. In an average individual, an estimated 4000 to 10,000 viable contaminated particles are shed by the skin each minute. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, a bacterium, is the most common type of particle on dispersed skin cells (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Phillips, 2017</a>). Surgical team members wear long-sleeved, sterile gowns and gloves. Head and hair are covered with a cap, and a mask is worn over the nose and mouth to minimize the possibility that bacteria from the upper respiratory tract will enter the wound. During surgery, only personnel who have scrubbed, gloved, and gowned touch sterilized objects. Nonscrubbed personnel refrain from touching or contaminating anything sterile.</p>
<p class="indent">An area of the patient&#x2019;s skin larger than that requiring exposure during the surgery is meticulously cleansed, and an antiseptic solution is applied (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Close attention is paid to the application dry time of the agent, in particular chlorhexidine and other alcohol-based products. If hair removal needs to take place and this was unable to be performed before the patient arrived in the OR suite, this is done immediately before the procedure with electric clippers (not shaved) to minimize the risk of infection (AORN, 2019a). The remainder of the patient&#x2019;s body is covered with sterile drapes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Environmental Controls</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the protocols described previously, surgical asepsis requires meticulous cleaning and maintenance of the OR environment. Floors and horizontal surfaces are cleaned between cases with detergent, soap, and water or a detergent germicide. Sterilized equipment is inspected regularly to ensure optimal operation and performance.</p>
<p class="indent">All equipment that comes into direct contact with the patient must be sterile. Sterilized linens, drapes, and solutions are used. Instruments are cleaned and sterilized in a unit near the OR. Individually wrapped sterile items are used when additional individual items are needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Airborne bacteria are a concern. To decrease the amount of bacteria in the air, standard OR ventilation provides 15 air exchanges per hour, at least three of which are fresh air (AORN, 2019a; Rothrock, 2019). A room temperature of 20&#x00B0; to 24&#x00B0;C (68&#x00B0; to 73&#x00B0;F), humidity between 30% and 60%, and positive pressure relative to adjacent areas are maintained. With the standard air exchanges, air counts of bacteria are reduced to 50 to 150 colony-forming units (CFUs) per cubic foot per minute. Systems with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are needed to remove particles larger than 0.3 &#x03BC;m (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Unnecessary personnel and physical movement may be restricted to minimize bacteria in the air and achieve an OR infection rate no greater than 3% to 5% in clean, infection-prone surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Some ORs have laminar airflow units. These units provide 400 to 500 air exchanges per hour (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). When used appropriately, laminar airflow units result in fewer than 10 CFUs per cubic foot per minute during surgery. The goal for a laminar airflow&#x2013;equipped OR is an infection rate of less than 1%. An OR equipped with a laminar airflow unit is frequently used for total joint replacement or organ transplant surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Even using all precautions, wound contamination may inadvertently occur. Constant surveillance and conscientious technique in carrying out aseptic practices are necessary to reduce the risk of contamination and infection.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Basic Guidelines for Maintaining Surgical Asepsis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">All practitioners involved in the intraoperative phase have a responsibility to provide and maintain a safe environment. Adherence to aseptic practice is part of this responsibility. The basic principles of aseptic technique follow (AORN, 2019a):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>All materials in contact with the surgical wound or used within the sterile field must be sterile. Sterile surfaces or articles may touch other sterile surfaces or articles and remain sterile; contact with unsterile objects at any point renders a sterile area contaminated.</span></li>
<li><span>Gowns of the surgical team are considered sterile in front from the chest to the level of the sterile field. The sleeves are also considered sterile from 2 inches above the elbow to the stockinette cuff.</span></li>
<li><span>Sterile drapes are used to create a sterile field (see <a href="#ff15-3">Fig.&#x00A0;15-3</a>). Only the top surface of a draped table is considered sterile. During draping of a table or patient, the sterile drape is held well above the surface to be covered and is positioned from front to back.</span></li>
<li><span>Items are dispensed to a sterile field by methods that preserve the sterility of the items and the integrity of the sterile field. After a sterile package is opened, the edges are considered unsterile. Sterile supplies, including solutions, are delivered to a sterile field or handed to a scrubbed person in such a way that the sterility of the object or fluid remains intact.</span></li></ul>

<ul class="bull"><li><span>The movements of the surgical team are from sterile to sterile areas and from unsterile to unsterile areas. Scrubbed people and sterile items contact only sterile areas; circulating nurses and unsterile items contact only unsterile areas.</span></li>
<li><span>Movement around a sterile field must not cause contamination of the field. Sterile areas must be kept in view during movement around the area. At least a 1-ft distance from the sterile field must be maintained to prevent inadvertent contamination.</span></li>
<li><span>Whenever a sterile barrier is breached, the area must be considered contaminated. A tear or puncture of the drape permitting access to an unsterile surface underneath renders the area unsterile. Such a drape must be replaced.</span></li>
<li><span>Every sterile field is constantly monitored and maintained. Items of doubtful sterility are considered unsterile. Sterile fields are prepared as close as possible to the time of use.</span></li>
<li><span>The routine administration of hyperoxia (high levels of oxygen) is <em>not</em> recommended to reduce SSIs.</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s498">Health Hazards Associated with the Surgical Environment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Faulty equipment, improper use of equipment, exposure to toxic substances, surgical plume (smoke generated by electrosurgical cautery), as well as infectious waste, cuts, needlestick injuries, and lasers are some of the associated hazards in the surgical environment (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Internal monitoring of the OR includes the analysis of surface swipe samples and air samples for infectious and toxic agents. In addition, policies and procedures for minimizing exposure to body fluids and reducing the dangers associated with lasers and radiation are identified in AORN standards (AORN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the size or location of an incision, unintentional retention of an object (e.g., sponge, instrument) can occur. A retained object can cause wound infection or disruption, an abscess can form, and fistulas may develop between organs (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Safety measures should be in place to reduce the risk of a retained object. Best practices include minimized distractions during the counting process, radiofrequency (RF) technology, and clear communication that includes the willingness to raise concerns among the surgical team members. RF technology acts as a &#x201C;back-up method&#x201D; for sponge counting using low-frequency RF chips inside sponges that can be detected via a wand or other scanning detection device. The technology is used in many institutions and can increase patient safety by detecting retained sponges before the surgeon closes the incision (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1287">Steelman, Schaapveld, Storm, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Laser Risks</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The AORN has recommended practices for laser safety (AORN, 2019a). When lasers are in use, warning signs must be posted on the doors and safety goggles must be available for staff to don prior to room entry. Personnel must also wear a protective mask to prevent inhalation of the plume emitted from the laser. The type of laser in use and the safety precautions in place are verified by all team members during the time-out (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Burlingame, 2017</a>). Several types of lasers are available for clinical use; perioperative personnel should be familiar with the unique features, specific operation, and safety measures for each type of laser used in the practice setting and wear appropriate laser goggles for the type of laser beam in use. Registered nurses trained and certified in laser safety maintain the established standards in the OR (AORN, 2019a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Smoke</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 500,000 health care workers are exposed to surgical smoke each year. This smoke is created from thermal destruction of tissue. Smoke plumes may contain toxic gases and vapors such as benzene, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, bioaerosols, dead and live cellular material, and viruses. It is estimated that in an average day, the effect of breathing surgical smoke could be comparable to smoking 30 unfiltered cigarettes. Perioperative nurses are twice as likely as the general population to report experiencing respiratory problems (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Davis, 2018</a>; <a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1289">US Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Smoke evacuators are used in some procedures to remove the plume from the operative field. If a smoke evacuator is not available, surgical team members should don an N95 respirator mask rather than a surgical mask, which does not prevent smoke from entering the airway orifices. In recent years, this technology has been extended to all surgical cases to protect the surgical team from the potential hazards associated with the generalized smoke plume generated by standard electric cautery units. Evacuating surgical smoke not only protects the perioperative team, but also patients (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Spruce, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Exposure to Blood and Body Fluids</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Basic scrub attire worn by sterile &#x201C;scrubbed-in&#x201D; OR personnel include double sterile gloves, eye protection, surgical mask, a sterile gown, and shoe covers. These help to protect against splashing, drilling, and blood loss exposure. In hospitals where numerous total joint procedures are performed, a complete bubble mask may be used. This mask provides full-barrier protection from bone fragments and splashes. Ventilation is accomplished through an accompanying hood with a separate air filtration system.</p>
<p class="indent">An estimated 380,000 sharps injuries occur in health care per year, and roughly one third of these occur in the OR setting. Interventions such as using sharps with safety engineered devices, passing sharps using a &#x201C;neutral zone&#x201D; or &#x201C;safe zone,&#x201D; and placing used sharps in puncture-resistant containers can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page424" title="424"></span>help to reduce these incidents (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Davis, 2018</a>). The &#x201C;neutral zone&#x201D; or &#x201C;safe zone&#x201D; techniques are designated spaces established for sharps to be put down and picked up (AORN, 2019).</p>
