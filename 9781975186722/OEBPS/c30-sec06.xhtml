<h4 class="h4" id="s1212">Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common malignancy of older adults, and the most prevalent type of adult leukemia in the Western world (NCCN, 2019d). The average age at diagnosis is 71 years (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019c). CLL is rarely seen in Native Americans and infrequently among people of Asian descent. Unlike other forms of leukemia, a strong familial predisposition exists with CLL; the disease can occur in 10% of those with a first- or second-degree relative with the same diagnosis. Veterans of the Vietnam War who were exposed to Agent Orange may be at risk for developing this disease (see the following section), but there is no definitive link to other pesticides or exposure to chemicals. While many patients will have a normal life expectancy, others will have a very short life expectancy due to the aggressive nature of the disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1213"> <img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Agent Orange was an herbicide used as a defoliant by the U.S. military in Vietnam from 1962 until 1975, when American involvement in the Vietnam War ended. Since that time, dioxin, a chemical used in Agent Orange, has been found to be carcinogenic. In particular, there is sufficient evidence that CLL, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are associated with Agent Orange exposure, while there is also evidence that suggests that Agent Orange exposure may be linked to multiple myeloma (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2020a). Approximately 3 million American veterans could have been exposed to the harmful effects of Agent Orange related to their military service in Vietnam. The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) has administered an <em>Agent Orange Registry</em> since 1978. Qualified veterans who enroll in the registry are eligible for health care benefits and consultations. Those veterans who develop cancers secondary to exposure to Agent Orange may be eligible for VA disability benefits (see Resources for additional information for veterans exposed to Agent Orange) (ACS, 2020a).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1214">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CLL is typically derived from a malignant clone of B lymphocytes. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;clone:&lt;/b&gt; proliferation from same cell of origin so that descendent cells are identical to the cell of origin">clone</button></strong> proliferates from a cell of origin so that descendent cells are identical to the cell of origin. In contrast to the acute forms of leukemia, most leukemic cells in CLL are fully mature. One possible mechanism that explains this oncogenesis is that these cells can escape <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apoptosis:&lt;/b&gt; a normal cell mechanism of programmed cell death">apoptosis</button></strong> (programmed cell death), resulting in an excessive accumulation of the cells in the marrow and circulation. CLL is characterized by the progressive accumulation of leukemic cells in the bone marrow, blood, and lymphoid tissues (NCCN, 2019d).</p>
<p class="indent">Because the lymphocytes are small, they can easily travel through the small capillaries within the circulation, and the pulmonary and cerebral complications of leukocytosis seen with myeloid leukemias are not typically found in CLL. However, these cells often accumulate within the lymph nodes and spleen. When it takes less than 12 months for the absolute number of lymphocytes to double (lymphocyte doubling time), a more aggressive disease course may ensue.</p>
<p class="indent">Immunophenotyping of the circulating B cells is critical to establish the diagnosis by identifying the presence of a malignant clone of these cells; it is also used to gauge the prognosis (NCCN, 2019d). Other special cytogenetic and molecular analyses (e.g., fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) are also used to guide prognosis and therapy. Beta-2 microglobulin, a protein found on the surface of lymphocytes, can be measured in the serum; an elevated level correlates with a more advanced clinical stage and poorer prognosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Autoimmune complications can occur at any stage, as either autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. In the autoimmune process, the reticuloendothelial system destroys the body&#x2019;s own erythrocytes or platelets. Patients with CLL also have a greater risk for developing other cancers. Approximately 2% to 10% of patients with CLL will experience transformation of their disease to a very aggressive lymphoma, known as Richter&#x2019;s transformation (NCCN, 2019d); this transformation results in markedly increased lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, B symptoms (see <strong><a href="#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a></strong>), and survival of only a few months despite treatment. Second cancers typically involve the skin, colon, lung, breast, prostate, and kidney.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1215">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally during routine physical examinations or during treatment for another disease. Lymphocytosis (an increased lymphocyte count) is always present. The erythrocyte and platelet counts may be normal or, in later stages of the illness, decreased. Lymphadenopathy is common; this can be severe and sometimes painful (see <a href="#ff30-4">Fig. 30-4</a>). Splenomegaly may also occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with CLL can develop B symptoms (see <strong><a href="#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a></strong>) which portends a worsening prognosis. T-cell function is impaired and may be the cause of tumor progression and increased susceptibility to second malignancies and infections. Life-threatening infections are particularly common with advanced disease, and account for over half of all deaths in this patient population. Viral infections, such as herpes zoster, can become widely disseminated. Defects in the complement system are also seen, which results in increased risk of developing infection with encapsulated organisms (e.g., <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>). Patients should receive an annual comprehensive skin examination (as the incidence of skin cancer is higher in this group), and screening guidelines for other cancers should be followed, such as for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer (NCCN, 2019d) (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec04.xhtml#tt12-3">Table 12-3</a>, for cancer screening guidelines).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1216">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For patients with no symptoms at the time of diagnosis, the traditional &#x201C;watch-and-wait&#x201D; approach is often used until progression of disease is noted (which could be months to years). However, with the advent of newer treatment modalities (i.e., targeted therapies and immunotherapy), treatment may be initiated sooner in the illness trajectory (NCCN, 2019d). Additionally, clinical trials are ongoing to assess for an advantage in survival with newer agents. Various parameters are considered when treatment is selected, including the clinical stage of the disease, disease-associated symptoms, the functional status of the patient, genetic risk, and the extent and efficacy of any prior treatment. Functional status is a complex consideration; in this context, it incorporates the individual&#x2019;s life expectancy independent of CLL (due to other health problems), the ability to tolerate aggressive therapy (e.g., creatinine clearance is particularly important), and the ability to perform activities of daily living (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019c; NCCN, 2019d). Patients with good functional status can typically tolerate aggressive therapy and often achieve a lasting complete remission. In contrast, the objective of treatment in those with more impaired physical status focuses on controlling bothersome symptoms (e.g., drenching night sweats, painful lymphadenopathy).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment for CLL is variable and can consist of a single immunotherapy agent administered in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, such as an immunotherapeutic antibody against the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (e.g., rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab) with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, bendamustine, chlorambucil) as initial therapy. The most commonly prescribed first-line chemotherapeutic agent is fludarabine. When the disease is accompanied by a deletion of the <em>TP53</em> gene or a mutation of this gene, TKIs such as ibrutinib or idelalisib may be used as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents (NCCN, 2019d). Depending upon the age of the patient (less than or greater than 65 years of age) and whether or not the patient has comorbidities, patients with relapsed or refractory disease may also receive newer agents such as venetoclax, duvelisib, or acalabrutinib (NCCN, 2019d).</p>
<p class="indent">The major side effect of fludarabine is prolonged bone marrow suppression, manifested by prolonged periods of neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which puts patients at risk for such infections as <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci, Listeria,</em> mycobacteria, herpes viruses, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) alemtuzumab is often used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents when the disease is refractory to fludarabine, the patient has very poor prognostic markers, or it is necessary to eradicate residual disease after initial treatment. Alemtuzumab targets the CD52 antigen commonly found on CLL cells, and it is effective in clearing the marrow and circulation of these cells without affecting the stem cells. Because CD52 is present on both B and T lymphocytes, patients receiving alemtuzumab are at significant risk for infection; prophylactic use of antiviral agents and antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole) is important and needs to continue for several months after treatment ends. CMV infection is also common with alemtuzumab, idelalisib, and duvelisib, and prophylaxis is important; among commonly prescribed antiviral agents, vancyclovir is more effective than acyclovir for treating CMV (NCCN, 2019d).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients receiving idelalisib or duvelisib have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, severe diarrhea, colitis, and pneumonitis. TKIs have been found to increase the risk of cardiovascular toxicities, including hypertension, prolonged QT interval, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2197">Olsen et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Ongoing periodic assessment of the CBC, blood chemistries, ECG, blood pressure, and bowel habits are important parameters to monitor among patients taking these various agents.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the older age of most patients with CLL, allogeneic HSCT may not be an option, particularly if significant comorbidities exist. However, allogeneic HSCT might be considered for some patients with <em>TP53</em> deletions or mutations who otherwise have a poor prognosis. Morbidity and mortality rates remain high (20%); thus, this treatment modality may be reserved for those patients with high-risk disease, younger age, and high degree of match from the donor (NCCN, 2019d).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1217">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Virtually all patients with CLL have reduced levels of immunoglobulins, and bacterial infections are common, independent of treatment. IV treatment with immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be given to select patients with recurrent infection. While studies have not demonstrated improved survival, the rate of developing major infections is reduced (NCCN, 2019d). Patients with CLL should receive both pneumonia and flu vaccinations as indicated. Live vaccines should be avoided. The patient with CLL is at increased risk of a host of infections; nursing interventions focused on diminishing these risks are summarized in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec07.xhtml#ct12-6">Chart 12-6</a>.</p>

<p class="processppara">Although the clinical picture varies with the type of leukemia as well as with the treatment implemented, the health history may reveal a range of subtle symptoms reported by the patient before the problem is detectable on physical examination. If the patient is hospitalized, assessments should be performed daily, or more frequently as warranted. Because the physical findings may be subtle initially, a thorough, systematic assessment incorporating all body systems is essential. For example, a dry cough, mild dyspnea, and diminished breath sounds may indicate a pulmonary infection. However, the infection may not be seen initially on the chest x-ray; the absence of neutrophils delays the inflammatory response against the pulmonary infection, thus delaying radiographic changes. When serial assessments are performed, current findings are compared with previous findings to evaluate improvement or worsening. Specific body system assessments are delineated in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page960" title="960"></span>the neutropenic and bleeding precautions found in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec07.xhtml#ct12-6">Chart 12-6</a>.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse also must closely monitor the results of laboratory studies, including tracking the leukocyte count, ANC, hematocrit, platelet, creatinine and electrolyte levels, and coagulation and hepatic function tests. Culture results need to be reported immediately so that appropriate antimicrobial therapy can begin or be modified.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> M<span class="small">UCOSITIS</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Although emphasis is placed on the oral mucosa, the entire GI mucosa can be altered, not only by the effects of chemotherapy but also from prolonged administration of antibiotics. See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for assessment and management of mucositis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> N<span class="small">UTRITIONAL</span> I<span class="small">NTAKE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The disease process can increase the patient&#x2019;s metabolic rate and nutritional requirements. Nutritional intake is often reduced because of pain and discomfort associated with stomatitis. Encouraging or providing mouth care before and after meals and administering analgesic agents before eating can help increase intake. If oral anesthetic agents are used, the patient must be warned to chew with extreme care to avoid inadvertently biting the tongue or buccal mucosa.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nausea should not interfere with nutritional intake, because appropriate antiemetic therapy is highly effective. However, nausea can result from antimicrobial therapy, so some antiemetic therapy may still be required after the chemotherapy has been completed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Small, frequent feedings of foods that are soft in texture and moderate in temperature may be better tolerated. Low-microbial diets may be prescribed (avoiding uncooked fruits or vegetables and those without a peelable skin), although there is little evidence to support this intervention (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2197">Olsen et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Nutritional supplements are frequently used. Daily body weight (as well as intake and output measurements) is useful in monitoring fluid status. Both calorie counts and more formal nutritional assessments are often useful. Parenteral nutrition may be required to maintain adequate nutrition.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<span class="small">ASING</span> P<span class="small">AIN AND</span> D<span class="small">ISCOMFORT</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Recurrent fevers are common in acute leukemia; at times, they are accompanied by shaking chills (rigors), which can be severe. Myalgias and arthralgias can result. Acetaminophen is typically given to decrease fever, but it also increases diaphoresis. Sponging with cool water may be useful, but cold water or ice packs should be avoided because the heat cannot dissipate from constricted blood vessels. Bedclothes need frequent changing as well. Gentle back and shoulder massage may provide comfort.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Mucositis can also cause significant discomfort. In addition to oral hygiene practices, patient-controlled analgesia can be effective in controlling the pain (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). With the exception of severe mucositis, less pain is associated with acute leukemia than with many other forms of cancer. However, the amount of psychological suffering that the patient endures can be immense. Patients often benefit from active listening and possible referral for professional counseling.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>D<span class="small">ECREASING</span> F<span class="small">ATIGUE AND</span> A<span class="small">CTIVITY</span> I<span class="small">NTOLERANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Fatigue is a common and oppressive symptom. Nursing interventions should focus on assisting the patient to establish a balance between activity and rest. Patients with acute leukemia need to maintain some physical activity and exercise to prevent the deconditioning that results from inactivity. The use of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter mask can permit the patient to ambulate outside the room despite severe neutropenia. Stationary bicycles may also be set up in the room; however, many patients lack the motivation or stamina to use them. At a minimum, patients should be encouraged to sit up in a chair while awake rather than staying in bed; even this simple activity can improve the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page961" title="961"></span>patient&#x2019;s tidal volume and enhance circulation. Physical therapy can also be beneficial. Patients with acute leukemia may require hospitalization for extensive nursing care (either during induction or consolidation therapy or during resultant complications); sleep deprivation frequently results. Nurses need to implement creative strategies that permit uninterrupted sleep for at least a few hours while still administering necessary medications on schedule (see Nursing Research Profile, <a href="#ct30-2">Chart 30-2</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Bryant, A., Gosselin, T., Coffman, E., et&#x00A0;al. (2018). Symptoms, mobility, and function, and quality of life in adults with acute leukemia during initial hospitalization. <em>Oncology Nursing Forum</em><em>,</em> <em>45</em>(5), 653&#x2013;664.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia require hospitalization, typically for 4 to 6 weeks, for managing aggressive induction therapy and its toxicities. These symptoms can greatly impact the patient&#x2019;s quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to evaluate global, physical, and mental health symptoms in adults with newly diagnosed acute leukemia.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a prospective, longitudinal study with a total of 49 adult participants, including 36 males and 13 females. Data were collected at time of hospitalization (baseline), then weekly until discharge from hospital. Evaluation tools for data included: the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to determine several self-reported quality-of-life measures such as fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbances, and global physical and mental health; the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) to measure symptom concerns that are leukemic specific; Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) to measure function; and the Timed UP and Go Test (TUG) to measure physical mobility.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study was the largest, to date, to evaluate the symptoms and quality of life of patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia during hospitalization. All participants had one or more comorbidities, as well as a group mean body mass index of 30.8 (SD = 6.7), indicative of being overweight or having obesity, at time of hospitalization. No significant differences were seen in global mental health, pain, or KPS during hospitalization. There were significant decreases in fatigue (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001), anxiety (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001), depression (<em>p</em> = 0.004), and sleep disturbance (<em>p</em> = 0.005) from baseline to hospital discharge. Also significant were a decrease in leukemic symptoms (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001), indicating improved leukemic outcomes, which is the goal of therapy.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses need to be aware of factors that can impact sleep in patients with cancer, both during and following treatment. As fatigue plays a major role in sleep disturbances, the nurse needs to assess for and develop strategies to address both concerns, especially while the patient is in the hospital. Poor sleep, fatigue, and pain can all contribute to the increased risk for falls, so safety issues should also be addressed with the patient and the patient&#x2019;s family. The nurse should encourage the patient to exercise and have some physical activity as part of the daily routine, to decrease fatigue while enhancing sleep. Additionally, the nurse should have a good understanding of the symptoms common to patients with leukemia and interventions to manage them as they occur.</p>

<p class="processppara">Febrile episodes, bleeding, and inadequate or overly aggressive fluid replacement can alter the patient&#x2019;s fluid status. Similarly, persistent diarrhea and vomiting that occur with certain chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents, and long-term use of certain antimicrobial agents can cause significant deficits in electrolytes. Intake and output need to be measured accurately, and daily weights should also be monitored. The patient should be assessed for signs of dehydration as well as fluid overload, with particular attention to pulmonary status and the development of dependent edema. Laboratory test results, particularly electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hematocrit, should be monitored and compared with previous results. Replacement of electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, is commonly required. Patients receiving amphotericin or certain antibiotics are at increased risk for electrolyte depletion.</p>

<p class="processppara">Because hygiene measures are so important in this patient population, they must be performed by the nurse when the patient cannot do so. However, the patient should be encouraged to do as much as possible to preserve mobility and function as well as self-esteem. Patients may have negative feelings because they can no longer care for themselves. Empathetic listening is helpful, as is realistic reassurance that these deficits are temporary. As the patient recovers, the nurse assists them to resume more self-care. Patients are usually discharged from the hospital with a vascular access device (e.g., Hickman catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC]), and coordination with appropriate home care services is needed for catheter management.</p>

<p class="processppara">Being diagnosed with acute leukemia can be extremely frightening. In many instances, the need to begin treatment is emergent, and the patient has little time to process the fact that they have the illness before making decisions about therapy. Providing emotional support and discussing the uncertain future are crucial. The nurse also needs to assess how much information the patient wants to have regarding the illness, its treatment, and potential complications. This desire should be reassessed at intervals, because needs and interest in information change throughout the course of the disease and treatment. Priorities must be identified so that procedures, assessments, and self-care expectations are adequately explained even to those who do not wish extensive information.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Many patients exhibit depressive symptoms and begin to grieve for their losses, such as normal family functioning, professional roles and responsibilities, and social roles, as well as physical functioning. The nurse can assist the patient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page962" title="962"></span>to identify the source of the grief and encourage them to allow time to adjust to the major life changes produced by the illness. Role restructuring, in both family and professional life, may be required. It is essential to encourage the patient to identify options and to take time in making important decisions.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s physical condition can deteriorate quickly and it is not often easy to discern if the patient may recover or will die from complications. Providing emotional support to both the patient and the family is critical and equally as important as is rendering expert physical care.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Discharge from the hospital can also provoke anxiety. Although most patients are eager to go home, they may lack confidence in their ability to manage potential complications and to resume their normal activity. Close communication between nurses across care settings can reassure patients that they will not be abandoned.</p>

<p class="processppara">Because acute leukemia is a serious, potentially life-threatening illness, the nurse may offer support to enhance the patient&#x2019;s spiritual well-being. The patient&#x2019;s spiritual and religious practices should be assessed and pastoral services offered. Throughout the patient&#x2019;s illness, the nurse assists the patient to maintain hope. However, that hope should be realistic and will certainly change over the course of the illness. For example, the patient may initially hope to be cured, but with repeated relapses and a change to hospice or palliative care, the same patient may hope for a quiet, dignified death. (Refer to <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for a discussion of palliative and end-of-life care.)</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Most patients cope better when they understand what is happening to them. Based on their health literacy level, and interest, educating the patient and family should begin with a focus on the disease (including some pathophysiology), its treatment, and certainly the resulting significant risk of infection and bleeding (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>, Charts 29-7 and 29-8).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Although management of a vascular access device can be taught to most patients or family members, this care is typically performed by a home care agency or outpatient clinic nursing staff. Patients and family members do need basic education regarding management of the vascular access device, particularly with regard to prevention of infections.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> For patients who are clinically stable but require parenteral antibiotics or blood products, these procedures are most often performed in an outpatient setting. Nurses in these settings must communicate regularly. They need to inform the patient about parameters that are important to monitor, how to monitor them, and to give the patient-specific instructions about when to seek care from the physician or other health care provider.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient and family need to have a clear understanding of the disease, the prognosis, and how to monitor for complications or recurrence. The nurse ensures that this information is provided. Should the patient no longer respond to therapy, it is important to respect the patient&#x2019;s choices about treatment and end-of-life care. Advance directives or other method should be used for patients to state their end-of-life preferences (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="c13-sec02.xhtml#ct13-5">Chart 13-5</a>). In patients with acute leukemia, death typically occurs from infection or, less frequently, from bleeding. Family members need to have information about these complications and the measures to take should either occur. Many family members cannot cope with the care required when a patient begins to bleed actively. It is important to delineate alternatives to keeping the patient at home, such as inpatient hospice units.</p>
