<h4 class="h4" id="s2451">Types of Breast Cancer</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2452">Ductal Carcinoma In Situ</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</strong> is characterized by the proliferation of malignant cells inside the milk ducts without invasion into the surrounding tissue. Unlike invasive breast cancer, DCIS does not metastasize and a woman generally does not die of DCIS unless it develops into invasive breast cancer. DCIS can develop into invasive breast cancer if left untreated. The best estimates are that 14% to 53% of untreated DCIS progresses to invasive breast cancer over a period of 10 years or more. However, the natural history of DCIS is not well understood, and it is currently not possible to accurately predict which women with DCIS will go on to develop invasive breast cancer (ACS, 2019). DCIS is frequently manifested on a mammogram with the appearance of calcifications and is considered breast cancer stage 0.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2453">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Current management takes into account the assurance of an accurate diagnosis, assessment of DCIS size and grade, and careful margin evaluation. The pathologist analyzes the piece of breast tissue removed to determine the type and grade of the DCIS or how abnormal the cells look when compared with normal breast cells and how fast they are growing. Grade&#x00A0;III (high-grade DCIS) cells tend to grow more quickly than grade I (low-grade) and grade II (moderate-grade) cells and look very different from normal breast cells. Accurate grading of DCIS is critical, because high nuclear grade and the presence of necrosis (the premature death of cells in living tissue) are highly predictive of the inability to achieve adequate margins or borders of healthy tissue around the cancer, of local recurrence, and of the probability of missed areas of invasion. The pros and cons of irradiating patients with DCIS who are treated conservatively should be carefully <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1720" title="1720"></span>weighed on a case-by-case basis, considering recent trials have shown that radiation has a beneficial effect on distant recurrence, breast cancer&#x2013;specific mortality, and overall survival. Breast conservation (treatment of a breast cancer without the loss of the breast) can be curative for well-defined subsets of women with DCIS, especially if the area of concern is very small (ACS, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2454">Invasive Cancer</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Invasive breast cancer includes several types of carcinoma and Paget disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Infiltrating ductal carcinoma&#x2014;the most common histologic type of breast cancer&#x2014;accounts for 70% to 80% of all cases (Komen, 2019b). The tumors arise from the duct system and invade the surrounding tissues. They often form a solid irregular mass in the breast (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Micropapillary invasive ductal carcinoma is a rare type of aggressive ductal cancer characterized by a high rate of axillary node metastasis and skin involvement (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Infiltrating lobular carcinoma accounts for 10% to 15% of breast cancers (Komen, 2019b). The tumors arise from the lobular epithelium and typically occur as an area of ill-defined thickening in the breast. They are often multicentric and can be bilateral (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Medullary Carcinoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medullary carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of breast cancers (Komen, 2019b), and it tends to be diagnosed more often in women younger than 50 years. The tumors grow in a capsule inside a duct. They can become large and may be mistaken for a fibroadenoma. The prognosis is often favorable (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mucinous Carcinoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Mucinous carcinoma accounts for about 2% of breast cancers and often presents in women who are postmenopausal and are 75 years and older (Komen, 2019b). A mucin producer, the tumor is also slow growing; thus, the prognosis is more favorable than in many other types (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tubular Carcinoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tubular carcinoma accounts for 1% to 5% of breast cancers (Komen, 2019b). Because axillary metastases are uncommon with this histology, prognosis is usually excellent.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Inflammatory Carcinoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Inflammatory carcinoma is a rare (1% to 5%) (ACS, 2019; Komen, 2019b) and aggressive type of breast cancer that has unique symptoms. The cancer is characterized by diffuse edema and erythema of the skin, often referred to as peau d&#x2019;orange. This is caused by malignant cells blocking the lymph channels in the skin. An associated mass may or may not be present; if there is a mass, it is often a large area of indiscrete thickening. Inflammatory carcinoma can be confused with an infection because of its presentation (Komen, 2019b). The disease can spread to other parts of the body rapidly. Chemotherapy often plays an initial role in controlling disease progression, but radiation and surgery may also follow (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Paget Disease</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Paget disease:&lt;/b&gt; form of breast cancer that begins in the ductal system and involves scaly changes in the nipple, areola, and surrounding skin">Paget disease</button></strong> of the breast accounts for 1% to 4% of diagnosed cases of breast cancer; it is more common in men than in women (Komen, 2019b). Symptoms typically include a scaly, erythematous, pruritic lesion of the nipple. Paget disease often represents DCIS of the nipple but may have an invasive component. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows DCIS without invasion, the prognosis is very favorable (Komen, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2455">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is no single, specific cause of breast cancer. A combination of genetic, hormonal, and possibly environmental factors may increase the risk of its development (see <span class="chart">Table&#x00A0;52-3</span>). More than 80% of all cases of breast cancer are sporadic, meaning that patients have no known family history of the disease. The remaining cases are either familial (there is a family history of breast cancer, but it is not passed on genetically) or genetically acquired. Research suggests that obesity, alcohol use, and smoking (especially when started before the first pregnancy) may increase risk (ACS, 2019). There is some evidence that late-in-life weight gain, a sedentary lifestyle, and night shift work may increase the risk for breast cancer (ACS, 2019). There is no evidence that silicone breast implants, the use of antiperspirants, underwire bras, or abortion (induced or spontaneous) increases the risk of the disease (ACS, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">As stated previously, breast cancer can be genetically inherited, resulting in significant risk. Approximately 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases have been linked to specific genetic mutations. Factors that may indicate a genetic link include multiple first-degree relatives with early-onset breast cancer, breast and ovarian cancer in the same family, male breast cancer, and Ashkenazi Jewish background. <strong><em>BRCA1</em></strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong><em>BRCA2</em></strong> are tumor suppressor genes that normally function to identify damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and thereby restrain abnormal cell growth (O&#x2019;Donnell, Axilbund, &#x0026; Euhus, 2018). Mutations in these genes on chromosome 17 are responsible for the majority of hereditary breast cancer in the United States. <em>BRCA</em> mutations in women have been associated with an overall risk of breast cancer up to 70% (ACS, 2019). Currently, women who are <em>BRCA</em> positive are counseled to start screening, typically using mammography, once a year and then MRI 6 months after the yearly mammography by 25 years of age, or 5 to 10 years earlier than their youngest affected family member. Mutations in the <em>PALB2</em> gene confer similar risk. Males who carry the <em>BRCA2</em> mutation may have a lifetime risk of 6% to 7% of developing breast cancer (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Jain &#x0026; Gradishar, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2456">Protective Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Certain factors may be protective against the development of breast cancer. Breast-feeding for at least 1 year, regular or moderate physical activity, and maintaining a healthy body weight are cited as protective (ACS, 2019). Some research suggests that the use of extra virgin olive oil, as is found in a Mediterranean diet, might be preventive, but recent research is inconclusive (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3793">Mayo Clinic, 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2457">Breast Cancer Prevention Strategies in the Patient Who Is at High Risk</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients often over- or underestimate their risk of developing breast cancer. A consultation with a breast specialist is of paramount importance prior to embarking on any of the prevention strategies that follow. Once patients have an accurate assessment of their risk, along with the knowledge of the pros and cons of each prevention strategy, they can make a decision that is most appropriate for their situation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Long-Term Surveillance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Long-term surveillance focuses on early detection. As recommended by the NCCN (2019), women at high risk for breast cancer benefit from additional screening using MRI along with a yearly mammogram. Clinical breast examinations may be performed twice a year starting as early as 25 years of age. Mammograms may also be performed as early as 25 years of age. Data concerning the effectiveness of BSE are limited. In addition to yearly mammography and MRI, other screening tests, including ultrasonography, may be useful.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chemoprevention</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chemoprevention is the main modality that aims to prevent the disease. Several national, randomized clinical trials have led to FDA approval of tamoxifen and raloxifene as effective chemopreventive agents for use in women who are at high risk (Mayo Clinic, 2019a). Tamoxifen has been shown to reduce risk by up to 50% even in women in whom up to three first-degree relatives are also affected (O&#x2019;Donnell et al., 2018). Because tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events, especially in postmenopausal women, it is more frequently recommended for premenopausal women. In women previously diagnosed with LCIS, who are at risk for developing invasive cancer, tamoxifen has been approved for use premenopausally, while raloxifene is recommended postmenopausally (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Calhoun &#x0026; Anderson, 2018</a>). Postmenopausally, anastrozole and exemestane are also now used for chemoprevention (Mayo Clinic, 2019a). Nurses can help women who are considering chemoprevention by providing them with information about the benefits, risks, and possible side effects of these medications.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1721</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1722" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1722">p. 1722</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Prophylactic Mastectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prophylactic mastectomy is another primary prevention modality that can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 90% to 95% (Mayo Clinic, 2019b) and is sometimes referred to as a &#x201C;risk-reducing&#x201D; mastectomy. The procedure consists of a total <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mastectomy:&lt;/b&gt; removal of the breast tissue and nipple&#x2013;areola complex">mastectomy</button></strong> (removal of breast tissue) and is usually accompanied by immediate breast reconstruction. Possible candidates include women with a strong family history of breast cancer, a diagnosis of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia, a mutation in a <em>BRCA</em> gene, and previous cancer in one breast. Because of physical and psychological ramifications including anxiety, depression, and altered body image, this procedure should be undertaken only after extensive counseling related to its risks and benefits. The procedure does not confer 100% protection against the development of breast cancer (Mayo Clinic, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">A multidisciplinary approach is used to help the patient arrive at a decision that is best for her. Consultation with a genetic counselor, plastic surgeon, medical oncologist, and psychiatrist can be invaluable. The patient needs to understand that this surgery is elective and not emergent. The nurse can play a valuable role in providing the patient with information, clarification, and support during the decision-making process.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2458">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Breast cancers can occur anywhere in the breast but are usually found in the upper outer quadrant, where the most breast tissue is located. In general, the lesions are nontender, fixed rather than mobile, and hard with irregular borders. Complaints of diffuse breast pain and tenderness with menstruation are usually associated with benign breast disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of mammography, more women are seeking treatment at earlier stages of the disease. These women often have no signs or symptoms other than a mammographic abnormality. Some women with advanced disease seek initial treatment after ignoring symptoms. Advanced signs may include skin dimpling, nipple retraction, or skin ulceration.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2459">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Techniques to determine the diagnosis of breast cancer include various types of biopsy, which have been described previously. Tumor staging and analysis of additional prognostic factors are used to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment regimen (see below).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2460">Staging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Staging involves classifying the cancer by the extent of the disease in the body. It is based on whether the cancer is invasive or noninvasive, the size of the tumor, how many lymph nodes are involved, and if it has spread to other parts of the body. The stage of a cancer is one of the most important factors in determining prognosis and treatment options. The most common system used to describe the stages of breast cancer is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) system (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec04.xhtml#ct12-3">Chart&#x00A0;12-3</a>). Other factors considered in staging include hormone receptors and genetic mutations.</p>
<p class="indent">Other diagnostic tests may be performed before or after surgery to help in the staging of the disease. The extent of testing often depends on the clinical presentation of the disease and may include chest x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scan, MRI scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bone scans, and blood work (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and tumor markers [i.e., carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 15-3]).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2461">Prognosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several different factors must be taken into consideration when determining the prognosis of a patient with breast cancer. Two of the most important factors are tumor size and whether the tumor has spread to the axillary (underarm) lymph nodes.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, the smaller the tumor appears, the better the prognosis. A tumor starts with a genetic alteration in a single cell and takes time to divide and double in size. A carcinoma may double in size 30 times to become 1 cm or larger, at which point it becomes clinically apparent. Doubling time varies, but breast tumors are often present for several years before they become palpable. Nurses can reassure patients that once breast cancer is diagnosed, they have a safe period of several weeks to make decisions regarding treatment; however, a lengthy delay is not advisable.</p>
<p class="indent">Prognosis also depends on the extent of spread of the breast cancer. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 88% for a stage I breast cancer and 15% for a stage IV breast cancer (ACS, 2019). The most common route of regional spread is to the axillary lymph nodes. Other sites of lymphatic spread include the internal mammary and supraclavicular nodes (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff52-5">Fig.&#x00A0;52-5</a></span>). Distant metastasis can affect any organ, but the most common sites are bone, lung, liver, and brain (<a href="http://Breastcancer.org">Breastcancer.org</a>, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the type of breast cancer and the stage, other factors may help determine prognosis (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-3">Chart&#x00A0;52-3</a></span>). Amplification (excessive number of copies of certain genes) or overexpression (excessive amounts of their protein product) may represent a poorer prognosis. The HER<strong>-</strong>2/neu (also known as <em>ERBB2</em>) oncogene is the classic example; approximately 20% of invasive breast cancers, which typically involve the more aggressive tumors, have amplification or overexpression of this gene (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3793">Mayo Clinic, 2020</a>). The proliferative rate or rapidity in growth rate (S-phase fraction) and DNA content (ploidy) of a tumor are factors that are also associated with overall survival rate.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2462">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The main goal of surgery is to gain local control of the disease. With breast cancer being diagnosed today at earlier stages, options for less invasive, breast conserving surgical procedures are available. Surgical treatment options for noninvasive and invasive breast cancer are summarized in <span class="chart"><a href="#tt52-4">Table&#x00A0;52-4</a></span>.</p>

The procedure involves removal of breast tissue, including the nipple&#x2013;areola complex. In addition, a portion of the axillary lymph nodes are also removed in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). If immediate breast reconstruction is desired, the patient is referred to a plastic surgeon prior to the mastectomy so that the patient has the opportunity to explore all available options (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-4">Chart&#x00A0;52-4</a></span>). In modified radical mastectomy, the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles are left intact, unlike in radical mastectomy, in which the muscles are removed.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Total Mastectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Like modified radical mastectomy, total mastectomy (i.e., simple mastectomy) also involves removal of the breast and nipple&#x2013;areola complex but does not include ALND. Total mastectomy may be performed in patients with noninvasive breast cancer (e.g., DCIS), which does not have a tendency to spread to the lymph nodes. It may also be performed prophylactically in patients who are at high risk for breast cancer (e.g., LCIS, <em>BRCA</em> mutation). A total mastectomy may also be performed in conjunction with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with invasive breast cancer.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The goal of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;breast conservation treatment:&lt;/b&gt; surgery to remove a breast tumor and a margin of tissue around the tumor without removing any other part of the breast; may or may not include lymph node removal and radiation therapy">breast conservation treatment</button></strong> (i.e., lumpectomy, wide excision, partial or segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy) is to excise the tumor in the breast completely and obtain clear margins while achieving an acceptable cosmetic result. If the procedure is being performed to treat a noninvasive breast cancer, lymph node removal is not necessary. For an invasive breast cancer, lymph node removal (SLNB or ALND) is indicated. The lymph nodes are removed through a separate semicircular incision in the axilla.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The status of the lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor in breast cancer. The SLNB is a less invasive alternative to ALND and is considered a standard of care for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. ALND is associated with potential morbidity, including lymphedema, cellulitis, decreased arm mobility, and sensory changes. Studies suggest that SLNB is highly accurate and is associated with a low axillary recurrence rate (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Prati, Chang, &#x0026; Chung, 2018</a>). <span class="chart"><a href="#tt52-5">Table&#x00A0;52-5</a></span> compares SLNB and ALND.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sentinel lymph node:&lt;/b&gt; first lymph node(s) in the lymphatic basin that receives drainage from the primary tumor in the breast; identified by a radioisotope or blue dye">sentinel lymph node</button></strong>, which is the first node (or nodes) in the lymphatic basin that receives drainage from the primary tumor in the breast, is identified by injecting a radioisotope or blue dye into the breast; the radioisotope or dye then travels via the lymphatic pathways to the node. In SLNB, the surgeon uses a handheld probe to locate the sentinel lymph node, excises it, and sends it for pathologic analysis, which is often performed immediately during the surgery using frozen-section analysis. If the sentinel lymph node is positive, the surgeon can proceed with an immediate ALND, thus sparing the patient a return trip to the operating room and additional anesthesia. (The patient could also return for additional surgery at a later time.) If the sentinel lymph node is negative, a standard ALND is not needed, thus sparing the patient the possible complications of the procedure. After the procedure is complete, all specimens are sent to pathology for more thorough analysis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2463">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who undergo SLNB in conjunction with breast conservation treatments are generally discharged the same day. Patients who undergo SLNB with total mastectomy usually stay in the hospital overnight, possibly longer if breast reconstruction is being performed. The patient must be informed that although frozen-section analysis is highly accurate, false-negative results can occur. A negative sentinel lymph node on frozen-section analysis may show metastatic disease on subsequent analysis, indicating that ALND is still necessary. The patient should also be reassured that the radioisotope and blue dye are generally safe. The nurse informs patients that they may notice a blue-green discoloration in the urine or stool for the first 24 hours as the blue dye is excreted. The incidence of lymphedema, decreased arm mobility, and seroma formation (collection of serous fluid) in the axilla is generally low, but the patient should be prepared for these possibilities. Women who have SLNB alone have neuropathic sensations similar to those who undergo ALND, although the prevalence and severity of these sensations and the resulting distress are lower with SLNB.</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong><strong>What Is Acceptable Treatment for a Patient with Breast Cancer during a Pandemic?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You work as a staff nurse on an oncology surgery unit. K.M. is a 37-year-old woman who is one day postoperative for a mastectomy for an invasive ductal carcinoma of her left breast. There is an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within your community. K.M. does not have COVID-19 and the surgical unit where you work has been designated to manage patients without COVID-19; nonetheless, a no visitor policy is enforced throughout your hospital and K.M. may not receive any visitors. When you enter K.M.&#x2019;s room to perform your baseline assessment, you find her crying. She says to you, &#x201C;This is terrible. When my sister had a mastectomy 3 years ago, she was able to have breast reconstruction done at the same time. I did not have that choice because only the mastectomy was considered essential&#x2014;the reconstruction was considered elective! I have to wait before I can have that done and go through surgery all over again! It is so unfair! And it is so unfair that my husband had to drop me off at the curb and cannot be with me! He is worried sick!&#x201D; K.M. is not the only patient you have cared for during this pandemic who has faced obstacles receiving what had previously been considered standard care. Additionally, many of your patients have voiced anger, frustration, anxiety, and fear because their loved ones are barred from being able to visit them postoperatively.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Access to health care resources can drastically change during a pandemic. Resources may be scarce not only for patients who are directly infected by the pathogen responsible for the pandemic, but for all patients. For instance, access to the services rendered by health care personnel (e.g., surgeons), facilities (e.g., surgical centers, operating rooms), pharmacologic agents, medical devices, to name a few, may all be disrupted or delayed because of societal needs to divert maximum resources to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Diversion of these resources can result in a scarcity of resources considered as standard therapy during other times. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to and delays in access to care for many patients with breast cancer, as well as patients with other cancers.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>). K.M. feels that she should have been eligible to have reconstruction done at the same time as her mastectomy. Her availability of choices and her personhood were arguably threatened by not being able to select her preferred surgical procedure. She might have elected to wait to have her mastectomy until such time as the breast reconstruction could have also been done; however, her risk of an adverse outcome related to her cancer would have been greater. Is it just to enforce these types of resource delays during a pandemic?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>K.M. expresses frustration at not being able to see her husband postoperatively. Are visitor prohibitions during a pandemic so much a threat to beneficence that they should not be enforced? Or are these types of universal prohibitions justifiable?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be mobilized to assist you in caring for K.M. and other patients on your unit? How can you assure that your professional need to deliver quality care to your patients is not threatened? How can you preserve your own sense of self-worth?</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse must not overlook the psychosocial needs of the patient who has undergone SLNB. Although SLNB is a less invasive procedure than ALND and results in a shorter recovery period, a patient who has undergone SLNB also has many difficult issues surrounding her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The nurse must listen, provide emotional support, and refer the patient to appropriate specialists when indicated.</p>

<p class="processppara">Many cancer centers have coordinators to help patients navigate appointments, decision-making, and care-paths. Nurses can encourage patients and their support persons to establish and maintain contact with these coordinators and utilize available resources as needed along their journeys. The nurse will reinforce a coordinator&#x2019;s support, if available; if no coordinator is available, nurses assume much of this responsibility.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer are expected to absorb an abundance of new information during a very emotionally difficult time, and this may lead to difficulty in making treatment decisions. The nurse plays a key role in reviewing treatment options by reinforcing information provided to the patient and answering any questions. The nurse fully prepares the patient for what to expect before, during, and after surgery. Patients undergoing breast conservation with ALND, or a total or modified radical mastectomy, generally remain in the hospital overnight (or longer if they have immediate reconstruction). Surgical drains will be inserted in the mastectomy incision and in the axilla if the patient undergoes ALND. A surgical drain is generally not needed after SLNB. The patient should be informed that she will go home with the drain(s) and that complete instructions about drain care will be provided prior to discharge. In addition, the patient should be informed that she will often have decreased arm and shoulder mobility after ALND and that she will be shown range-of-motion exercises prior to discharge. The patient should also be reassured that appropriate analgesia and comfort measures will be provided to alleviate any postoperative discomfort.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> F<small>EAR AND</small> A<small>NXIETY AND</small> I<small>MPROVING</small> C<small>OPING</small> A<small>BILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse helps the patient cope with the physical and emotional effects of surgery. Many fears may emerge during the preoperative phase. These can include fear of pain, mutilation (after mastectomy), and loss of sexual attractiveness; concern about inability to care for oneself and one&#x2019;s family; concern about taking time off from work; and coping with an uncertain future. Providing the patient with realistic expectations about the healing process and expected recovery can help alleviate fears. Maintaining open communication and assuring the patient that she can contact the nurse at any time with questions or concerns can be a source of comfort. The patient should also be made aware of available resources at the treatment facility as well as in the breast cancer community such as social workers, psychiatrists, and support groups. Some women find it helpful and reassuring to talk to a survivor of breast cancer who has undergone similar treatments.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> D<small>ECISION</small>-M<small>AKING</small> A<small>BILITY</small></strong></p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1725</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1726" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1726">p. 1726</span></div>
<p class="processppara">The patient may be eligible for more than one therapeutic approach; she may be presented with treatment options and then asked to make a choice. This can be very frightening for some patients, and they may prefer to have someone else make the decision for them (e.g., surgeon, family member). The nurse can be instrumental in ensuring that the patient and family members truly understand their options. The nurse can then help the patient weigh the risks and benefits of each option. The patient may be presented with the option of having breast conservation treatment followed by radiation or a mastectomy. The nurse can explore the issues with the patient by asking questions such as the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>How do you think you might feel about losing your breast?</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are you considering breast reconstruction?</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you choose to retain your breast, would you consider undergoing radiation treatments 5 days a week for 5 to 6 weeks?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Questions such as these can help the patient focus. Once the patient&#x2019;s decision is made, it is very important to support it.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Postoperative Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN AND</small> D<small>ISCOMFORT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Many patients tolerate breast surgery well and have minimal pain during the postoperative period. This is particularly true of less invasive procedures such as breast conservation treatment with SLNB. However, all patients must be carefully assessed, because individual patients can have varying degrees of pain. Patients who have had more invasive procedures, such as a modified radical mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, may have considerably more pain. All patients are discharged home with analgesic medication (e.g., oxycodone and acetaminophen) and are encouraged to take it if needed. An over-the-counter analgesic agent such as acetaminophen may provide sufficient relief. Patients sometimes complain of a slight increase in pain after the first few days of surgery; this may occur as patients regain sensation around the surgical site and become more active. However, patients who report more than moderate pain must be evaluated to rule out any potential complications such as infection or hematoma. Postoperative pain may be more common in patients who have had axillary dissection: the amount of discomfort may increase with each additional node removed. (Komen, 2019a). Alternative methods of pain management, such as taking warm showers (if permitted by the surgeon) and using distraction methods (e.g., guided imagery), may also be helpful. See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion of methods that relieve pain.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OSTOPERATIVE</small> S<small>ENSATIONS</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Because nerves in the skin and axilla are often ligated or injured during breast surgery, patients experience a variety of sensations. Common sensations include tenderness, soreness, numbness, tightness, pulling, and twinges. These sensations may occur along the chest wall, in the axilla, and along the inside aspect of the upper arm. After mastectomy, some patients experience phantom sensations and report a feeling that the breast or nipple is still present. Overall, patients do not find these sensations severe or distressing. Sensations usually persist for several months and then begin to diminish, although some may persist for as long as 5 years and possibly longer. Patients should be reassured that this is a normal part of healing and that these sensations are not indicative of a problem.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> P<small>OSITIVE</small> B<small>ODY</small> I<small>MAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients who have undergone mastectomy may find it difficult to view the surgical site for the first time. No matter how prepared the patient may think she is, the appearance of an absent breast can be very emotionally distressing. Ideally, the patient sees the incision for the first time when she is with the nurse or another health care provider who is available for support.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse first assesses the patient&#x2019;s readiness and provides gentle encouragement. It is important to maintain the patient&#x2019;s privacy while assisting her as she views the incision; this allows her to express feelings safely to the nurse. Asking the patient what she perceives, acknowledging her feelings, and allowing her to express her emotions are important nursing actions. Reassuring the patient that her feelings are a normal response to breast cancer surgery may be comforting. If the patient has not had immediate reconstruction, providing her with a temporary breast form or soft padding to place in her bra on discharge can help alleviate feelings of embarrassment or self-consciousness.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> P<small>OSITIVE</small> A<small>DJUSTMENT AND</small> C<small>OPING</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Providing ongoing assessment of how the patient is coping with her diagnosis of breast cancer and her surgical treatment is important in determining her overall adjustment. Assisting the patient in identifying and mobilizing her support systems can be beneficial to her well-being. The patient&#x2019;s spouse or partner may also need guidance, support, and education. The patient and partner may benefit from a wide network of available community resources, including the Reach to Recovery program of the ACS, advocacy groups, social worker, or a spiritual advisor. Encouraging the patient to discuss issues and concerns with other patients who have had breast cancer may help her to understand that her feelings are normal and that other women who have had breast cancer can provide invaluable support and understanding.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient may also have considerable anxiety about the treatments that will follow surgery (i.e., chemotherapy and radiation) and their implications. Providing her with information about the plan of care and referring her to the appropriate members of the health care team also promote coping during recovery. Some women require additional support to adjust to their diagnosis and the changes that it brings. If a woman displays difficulty coping, consultation with a mental health provider may be indicated. Nurse navigators can help those undergoing breast biopsy to cope.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="h4a">Lymphedema.</span> <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lymphedema:&lt;/b&gt; chronic swelling of an extremity due to interrupted lymphatic circulation, typically from an axillary lymph node dissection">Lymphedema</button></strong> is a complication characterized by a chronic swelling of an extremity due to interrupted lymphatic circulation. The swelling is due to the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial space and is a somewhat common postoperative complication after ALND. It often affects both the breast and ipsilateral limb. It is associated with a painful swelling of the arm as well as weakness, shoulder pain, and tingling sensations in the arm and shoulder. After ALND, the risk of developing lymphedema may be as low as 11% or as high as 57% (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Rivere &#x0026; Klimberg, 2018</a>). Because sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) involves more focused surgery and less disruption of the axilla, the risk is only up to 7% within 5 years (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Rivere &#x0026; Klimberg, 2018</a>). Risk factors for lymphedema in mixed-age groups include ALND, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1727" title="1727"></span>concomitant radiation therapy, increased age, presence of a concomitant infection, preexisting cardiovascular conditions, and obesity (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Rivere &#x0026; Klimberg, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Lymphedema results if functioning lymphatic channels are inadequate to ensure a return flow of lymph fluid to the general circulation. After axillary lymph nodes are removed, collateral circulation must assume this function. Transient edema in the postoperative period occurs until collateral circulation has completely taken over this function, which generally occurs within a month. Performing prescribed exercises, elevating the arm above the heart several times a day, and gentle muscle pumping (making a fist and releasing) can help reduce the transient edema. The patient needs reassurance that this transient swelling is not lymphedema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Once lymphedema develops, it tends to be chronic, so preventive strategies are vital. After ALND, the patient is taught hand and arm care to prevent injury or trauma to the affected extremity, thus decreasing the likelihood for development of lymphedema (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-5">Chart&#x00A0;52-5</a></span>). The patient is instructed to follow these guidelines for the rest of her life. She is also instructed to contact her primary provider immediately if she suspects that she has lymphedema, because early intervention provides the best chance for control. If allowed to progress without treatment, the swelling can become more difficult to manage. Treatment may consist of a course of antibiotic agents if an infection is present. A referral to a rehabilitation specialist (e.g., occupational or physical therapist) may be necessary for a compression sleeve or glove, exercises, manual lymph drainage, and a discussion of ways to modify daily activities to avoid worsening lymphedema. Ongoing research is seeking to identify which lymph nodes drain the arm before surgery so that they can be preserved when possible, helping to prevent the development of lymphedema. The practice of yoga may result in improved shoulder range of motion and upper extremity strength in women with postoperative lymphedema (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3797">Mazor, Lee, Peled, et al., 2018</a>).

<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="h4a">Hematoma or Seroma Formation.</span> Hematoma formation (collection of blood inside a cavity) may occur after either mastectomy or breast conservation and usually develops within the first 12 hours after surgery. The nurse assesses for signs and symptoms of hematoma at the surgical site, which may include swelling, tightness, pain, and bruising of the skin. The surgeon should be notified immediately if there is gross swelling or increased bloody output from the drain. Depending on the surgeon&#x2019;s assessment, a compression wrap may be applied to the incision for approximately 12 hours, or the patient may be returned to the operating room so that the incision may be reopened to identify the source of bleeding. Some hematomas are small, and the body absorbs the blood <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1728" title="1728"></span>naturally. The patient may take warm showers (if permitted by the surgeon) or apply warm compresses to help increase the absorption. A hematoma usually resolves in 4 to 5 weeks.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Effect of Yoga on Lymphedema</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Mazor, M., Lee, J. Q., Peled, A., et al. (2018). The effect of yoga on arm volume, strength, and range of motion in women at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema. <em>Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine</em>, <em>24</em>(2), 154&#x2013;160.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a complication of breast cancer that causes considerable morbidity. The intent of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and initial estimates of efficacy of a yoga program in the postoperative care of women at increased risk for BCRL.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Twenty-one women were recruited at a breast care center in California. All participants were over 18 years of age, had undergone surgical intervention for breast cancer, and were at high risk for lymphedema. Women participated in an 8-week regimen of Ashtanga yoga, taking one instructor-led class weekly and also completing one self-led session weekly. Poses focused on upper-body strength and flexibility, while also avoiding placing the affected arm in a dependent position. Measurements of upper extremity volume, range of motion, and strength were assessed.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Twenty of the 21 participants finished the 8-week intervention and 17 completed the final assessment. The mean age was 52 years and body mass index was 24.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Postintervention mean upper extremity volumes were slightly decreased in the at-risk arm (<em>p</em> = 0.397). Range of motion in both shoulder flexion (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.01) and external rotation (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.05) improved significantly. After the intervention, strength also improved on the affected side for shoulder abduction, grip strength, and bilaterally for elbow flexion (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.05 for all).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses should know that yoga is feasible and safe to recommend for women at risk for BCRL and may result in small improvements in shoulder range of motion and upper extremity strength. Many women may have already been exposed to yoga or similar exercises prior to their cancer diagnosis and nurses can encourage these women to facilitate integration of this intervention into their postoperative care. The added benefits of yoga in providing stress reduction, mindfulness, breathing practices, and meditation may also contribute to a woman&#x2019;s sense of well-being and self-care.</p>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">A seroma, a collection of serous fluid, may accumulate under the breast incision after mastectomy or breast conservation or in the axilla. Signs and symptoms may include swelling, heaviness, discomfort, and a sloshing of fluid. Seromas may develop temporarily after the drain is removed or if the drain is in place and becomes obstructed. Seromas rarely pose a threat and may be treated by unclogging the drain or manually aspirating the fluid with a needle and syringe. Large, long-standing seromas that have not been aspirated may lead to infection. Small seromas that are not bothersome to the patient usually resolve on their own.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Infection.</span> Although infection is rare, it is a risk after any surgical procedure. This risk may be higher in patients with conditions such as diabetes, immune disorders, and advanced age, as well as in those with poor hygiene. Patients are taught to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection (redness, warmth around incision, tenderness, foul-smelling drainage, temperature greater than 38&#x00B0;C [100.4&#x00B0;F], chills) and to contact the surgeon or nurse for evaluation. Treatment consists of oral or IV antibiotics (for more severe infections) for 1 or 2 weeks. Cultures are taken of any foul-smelling discharge.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Changes in Sexual Function.</span> Once discharged from the hospital and feeling well, most patients are physically allowed to engage in sexual activity, if interested. However, any change in the patient&#x2019;s body image, self-esteem, or the response of her partner may increase her anxiety level and affect sexual function. Some partners may have difficulty looking at the incision, whereas others may be completely unaffected. Encouraging the patient to openly discuss how she feels about herself and about possible reasons for a decrease in libido (e.g., fatigue, anxiety, self-consciousness) may help clarify issues for her. Helpful suggestions for the patient may include varying the time of day for sexual activity (when the patient is less tired), assuming positions that are more comfortable, and expressing affection using alternative measures (e.g., hugging, kissing, manual stimulation).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Most patients and their partners adjust with minimal difficulty if they openly discuss their concerns. However, if issues cannot be resolved, a referral for counseling (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist, psychiatric clinical nurse specialist, social worker, sex therapist) may be helpful. The ambulatory care nurse in the outpatient clinic or hospital should inquire whether the patient who was sexually active prior to surgery has resumed activities, because many patients are reluctant or embarrassed to bring this topic up themselves.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> <span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patients who undergo breast cancer surgery receive a tremendous amount of information both pre- and postoperatively. It is often difficult for the patient to absorb all of the information, partly because of the emotional distress that often accompanies the diagnosis and treatment. Prior to discharge, the nurse must assess the patient&#x2019;s readiness to assume self-care responsibilities and identify any gaps in knowledge. A review of education provided in written and oral forms, with reinforcement, may be required to ensure that the patient and family are prepared to manage the necessary care at home. The nurse reiterates symptoms that the patient should report, such as infection, seroma, hematoma, or arm swelling. All instruction should be reinforced during office visits and by telephone.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Most patients are discharged 1 or 2 days after ALND or mastectomy (possibly later if they have had immediate reconstruction) with surgical drains in place. Initially, the drainage fluid appears bloody, but it gradually changes to a serosanguineous and then a serous fluid over the next several days. The patient is given instructions about drainage management at home (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-7">Chart&#x00A0;52-7</a></span>). If the patient lives alone and drainage management is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1729" title="1729"></span>difficult, a referral for a home health nurse should be made. The drains are usually removed when the output is less than 30&#x00A0;mL in two consecutive 24-hour periods (approximately 7 to 10 days) (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Grobmyer &#x0026; Bland, 2018</a>). The home health nurse also reviews pain management and incision care.</p>

</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">In general, the patient may shower on the second postoperative day and wash the incision and drain site with soap and water to prevent infection. Some surgeons do not permit showers until 48 hours after drains are removed. If immediate reconstruction has been performed, showering may be contraindicated until the drain is removed. A dry dressing may be applied to the incision each day for 7 days. The patient should realize that sensation may be decreased in the operative area because the nerves were disrupted during surgery, and she should be informed that gentle care is needed to avoid injury. After the incision has completely healed (usually after 4 to 6 weeks), lotions or creams may be applied to the area to increase skin elasticity. The patient can begin to use deodorant on the affected side, although many women note that they no longer perspire as much as before the surgery.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After ALND, patients are taught arm exercises on the affected side to restore range of motion (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct52-8">Chart&#x00A0;52-8</a></span>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1730" title="1730"></span>After SLNB, patients may also benefit from these exercises, although they are less likely to have decreased range of motion than those who have undergone ALND. Range-of-motion exercises are initiated on the second postoperative day; however, instruction often occurs on the first postoperative day. The goals of the exercise regimen are to increase circulation and muscle strength, prevent joint stiffness and contractures, and restore full range of motion. The patient is instructed to perform range-of-motion exercises at home three times a day for 20 minutes at a time until full range of motion is restored (generally 4 to 6 weeks). Most patients find that after the drain is removed, range of motion returns quickly if they have adhered to their exercise program.</p>

<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah_b">1.</span><em>Wall hand climbing.</em> Stand facing the wall with feet apart and toes as close to the wall as possible. With elbows slightly bent, place the palms of the hand on the wall at shoulder level. By flexing the fingers, work the hands up the wall until arms are fully extended.

</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient is having any discomfort, taking an analgesic agent 30 minutes before beginning the exercises can be helpful. Taking a warm shower before exercising can also loosen stiff muscles and provide comfort. When exercising, the patient is encouraged to use the muscles in both arms and to maintain proper posture. Specific exercises may need to be prescribed and introduced gradually if the patient has had skin grafts; has a tense, tight surgical incision; or has had immediate reconstruction. Self-care activities, such as brushing the teeth, washing the face, and brushing the hair, are physically and emotionally therapeutic because they aid in restoring arm function and provide a sense of normalcy for the patient.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is instructed about postoperative activity limitation. In general, heavy lifting (more than 5 to 10 lb) is avoided for about 4 to 6 weeks, although normal household and work-related activities are promoted to maintain muscle tone. Brisk walking, the use of stationary bikes and stepping machines, and stretching exercises may begin as soon as the patient feels comfortable. Once the drain is removed, the patient may begin to drive if she has full arm range of motion and is no longer taking opioid analgesic agents. General guidelines for activity focus on the gradual introduction of previous activities (e.g., bowling, weight training) once fully healed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Patients who have difficulty managing their postoperative care at home may benefit from a referral for home health, transitional, or community-based care. The nurse making a home visit assesses the patient&#x2019;s incision and surgical drain(s), adequacy of pain management, adherence to the exercise plan, and overall physical and psychological functioning. In addition, the home health nurse reinforces previous education and communicates important physiologic findings and psychosocial issues to the patient&#x2019;s primary provider, nurse, or surgeon.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The frequency of follow-up visits after surgery may vary but generally should occur every 3 to 6 months for the first several years. These visits may occur with the surgeon, medical oncologist or radiation oncologist, depending on the treatment regimen. The ambulatory care nurse can also be a great source of education for the patient and family and should encourage them to telephone if they have any questions or concerns. It is common for people to ignore routine health care when a major health issue arises, so women who have been treated for breast cancer should be reminded of the importance of participating in routine health screening.</p>
