<h4 class="h4" id="s938">Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pericardial effusion (accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac) may accompany advanced HF, pericarditis, metastatic carcinoma, cardiac surgery, or trauma. Normally, the pericardial sac contains about 20 mL of fluid, which is needed to decrease friction for the beating heart. An increase in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page812" title="812"></span>pericardial fluid raises the pressure within the pericardial sac and compresses the heart. This has the following effects:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Elevated pressure in all cardiac chambers</span></li>
<li><span>Decreased venous return due to atrial compression</span></li>
<li><span>Inability of the ventricles to distend and fill adequately</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Pericardial fluid may build up slowly without causing noticeable symptoms until a large amount (1 to 2 L) accumulates (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Hoit, 2019</a>). However, a rapidly developing effusion (e.g., hemorrhage into the pericardial sac from chest trauma) can quickly stretch the pericardium to its maximum size and cause an acute problem. As pericardial fluid increases, pericardial pressure increases, reducing venous return to the heart and decreasing CO. This can result in cardiac tamponade, which causes low CO and obstructive shock.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s939">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The signs and symptoms of pericardial effusion can vary according to whether the problem develops quickly or slowly. In acute cardiac tamponade, the patient suddenly develops chest pain, tachypnea, and dyspnea. JVD results from poor right atrial filling and increased venous pressure. Hypotension occurs from low CO, and heart sounds are often muted. The subacute presentation of a pericardial effusion is less dramatic. The patient may report chest discomfort or a feeling of fullness. The feeling of pressure in the chest may result from stretching of the pericardial sac. These patients also develop dyspnea, JVD, and hypotension over time (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Hoit, 2019</a>). Patients with cardiac tamponade typically have tachycardia in response to low CO. In addition to hypotension, patients with cardiac tamponade may develop <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pulsus paradoxus:&lt;/b&gt; systolic blood pressure that is more than 10 mm Hg lower during inhalation than during exhalation; difference is normally less than 10 mm Hg">pulsus paradoxus</button></strong>, a systolic blood pressure that is markedly lower during inhalation. Also known as paradoxical pulse, this finding is characterized by an abnormal difference of at least 10 mm Hg in systolic pressure between the point that it is heard during exhalation and the point that it is heard during inhalation. This difference is caused by the variation in cardiac filling that occurs with changes in intrathoracic pressure during breathing. The cardinal signs of cardiac tamponade are illustrated in <a href="#ff25-4">Figure 25-4</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s940">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An echocardiogram is performed to confirm the diagnosis and quantify the amount of pericardial fluid. A chest x-ray may show an enlarged cardiac silhouette due to pericardial effusion. The ECG shows tachycardia and may also show low voltage (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Hoit, 2019</a>). See Chapter 22 for discussion of the significance of ECG abnormalities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s941">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute management of cardiac tamponade may include a pericardiocentesis; whereas, recurrent effusions may be managed with a pericardiotomy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pericardiocentesis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If cardiac function becomes seriously impaired, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pericardiocentesis:&lt;/b&gt; procedure that involves aspiration of fluid from the pericardial sac">pericardiocentesis</button></strong> (puncture of the pericardial sac to aspirate pericardial fluid) is performed. During this procedure, the patient is monitored by continuous ECG and frequent vital signs. Catheter pericardiocentesis is performed using echocardiography to guide placement of the drainage catheter (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Hoit, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A resulting decrease in central venous pressure and an associated increase in blood pressure after withdrawal of pericardial fluid indicate that the cardiac tamponade has been relieved. The patient almost always feels immediate relief. If there is a substantial amount of pericardial fluid aspirated, a small catheter may be left in place to drain recurrent accumulation of blood or fluid. Pericardial fluid is sent to the laboratory for examination for tumor cells, bacterial culture, chemical and serologic analysis, and differential blood cell count.</p>
<p class="indent">Complications of pericardiocentesis include coronary artery puncture, myocardial trauma, arrhythmias, pleural laceration, and gastric puncture. After pericardiocentesis, the patient&#x2019;s heart rhythm, blood pressure, venous pressure, and heart sounds are monitored frequently to detect possible recurrence of cardiac tamponade. A follow-up echocardiogram is also performed. If the effusion recurs, repeat aspiration is necessary. Cardiac tamponade may require treatment by open surgical drainage (pericardiotomy) (<a href="c25-sec05.xhtml#bib1903">Hoit, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pericardiotomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Recurrent pericardial effusions, usually associated with neoplastic disease, may be treated by a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pericardiotomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgically created opening of the pericardium">pericardiotomy</button></strong> (pericardial window). Under general anesthesia, a portion of the pericardium is excised to permit the exudative pericardial fluid to drain into the lymphatic system. The nursing care following the procedure includes routine postsurgical care (see Chapter 16) in addition to observation for recurrent tamponade.</p>
