<h4 class="h4" id="s8">Influences on Health Care Delivery</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The health care delivery system is constantly adapting to changes in health care needs and expectations. Shifting population demographics; changing patterns of disease and wellness; advances in technology and genetics; and greater emphasis on health care quality, costs, reform efforts, and interprofessional collaborative practices have impacted health care delivery and the practice of nursing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s9">Population Demographics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Changes in the population in general are affecting the need for and the delivery of health care. According to the United States (U.S.) Census Bureau (2020), over 329 million people reside in the country. Not only is the population increasing, but its composition is also changing. The decline in birth rate and the increase in lifespan have resulted in proportionately fewer school-age children and more senior citizens, many of whom are women. Much of the population resides in highly congested urban areas, with a steady migration of members of ethnic minorities to urban settings. Poverty is a growing concern. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x2019;s (HUD&#x2019;s) 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, on a given night, approximately 568,000 individuals were documented as homeless in the United States. Homelessness increased by 3% from 2018 to 2019, with almost 40% of this population staying on the streets or other unsheltered locations; in addition, a higher percentage of minority populations compared to the total U.S. population are impacted by homelessness today (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Both the number and proportion of Americans 65 years of age and older have grown substantially in the past century. In 2017, an estimated 47.8 million older adults resided in the United States; this number continues to climb, with the greatest growth in the Hispanic population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">The health care needs of older adults are complex and demand significant investments, both professional and financial (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> for further discussion). Many older adults suffer from multiple chronic conditions that are exacerbated by acute episodes. In particular, older women are frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. According to the United Nations&#x2019; (2017) report on world population aging, globally, the number of people 80 years of age or older is projected to increase more than threefold between 2017 and 2050, rising from 137 to 425 million.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Veterans of the U.S. armed services comprise a unique population with health care needs that vary dependent upon branch of military service, whether service occurred during wartime eras, time and place of service, and individual experiences (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Olenick, Flowers, &#x0026; Diaz, 2015</a>). According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2019), there are currently 18 million veterans, 1.8 million of whom are female. Substance use disorders (SUDs), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), suicide, depression, hazardous substance exposure, and amputations are common health care problems found among veterans (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Olenick et al., 2015</a>) (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). According to a Pew Research Center (2017) report, the proportion of Americans who served in the U.S. military has been steadily declining since 1980, when 18% of American adults were veterans. In 2016, 7% of Americans were veterans. That proportion is projected to continue to decline, and by 2045 the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs estimates that there will be approximately 12 million veterans, roughly a 40% decrease from 2016 (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib59">Pew Research Center, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cultural Diversity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An appreciation for the diverse characteristics and needs of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds is important in health care and nursing. Some projections indicate that by 2030, racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States will triple. The latest U.S. census classified five distinct races as White, Black or African American, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. The Asian race had the largest growth rate among these five racial groups. The Hispanic population, classified primarily under the White race, was noted to account for more than half of the increased population growth. The non-Hispanic Caucasian population will proportionally decrease so that they will no longer comprise the majority population, and other ethnic and racial minority populations will collectively comprise the majority of all Americans by approximately 2044 (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Colby &#x0026; Ortman, 2015</a>). As the cultural composition of the population changes, it is increasingly important to address cultural considerations in the delivery of health care. Patients from diverse sociocultural groups not only bring various health care beliefs, values, and practices to the health care setting but also have unique risk factors for some disease conditions and unique reactions to treatment. These factors significantly affect a person&#x2019;s responses to health care problems or illnesses, to caregivers, and to the care itself. Unless these factors are assessed, understood, and respected by nurses, the care delivered may be ineffective, and health care outcomes may be negatively affected (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for additional information on cultural assessment).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s10">Changing Patterns of Disease and Wellness</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the past several decades, the health problems of Americans have changed significantly. Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases account for 7 out of the 10 leading causes of death (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib32">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page8" title="8"></span>Nearly half of all adults live with one diagnosed chronic condition; 60 million live with two or more (CDC, 2019). Tobacco use, SUD (e.g., alcohol, illicit drugs), poor physical activity and nutrition habits, and obesity have become major health concerns (CDC, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">As the prevalence of chronic conditions increases, health care broadens from a focus on cure and eradication of disease to include health promotion and the prevention or rapid treatment of exacerbations of chronic conditions. Nursing, which has always encouraged patients to take control of health and wellness, has a prominent role in the current focus on management of chronic illness and disability (see <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><em>Healthy People 2030</em></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <em>Healthy People</em> initiatives identify important periodic goals that, if reached, could have major impacts on the health and overall well-being of people in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2020a). Since their inception over four decades ago, these initiatives have contributed to substantial decreases in cancer and cardiovascular deaths, infant and maternal mortality, and improvements in vaccinations (HHS, 2020a). Leading health indicators (LHIs) or goals outlined in the <em>Healthy People 2020</em> initiative aimed to improve access to health services, environmental quality, use of preventive services, nutrition and physical activity, and to address social determinants of health, while decreasing rates of injury and violence, obesity, tobacco use, and substance abuse, among others (HHS, 2020b). This initiative considered social influences that shape health, such as poverty and social injustices, rather than simply focusing on disease states. To date, significant progress has been made in decreasing the number of adults who are smoking and in improving physical activity of adults (HHS, 2020b). The <em>Healthy People 2030</em> framework, guided the development of the <em>Healthy People 2030</em> initiative and identified the need to collaborate more effectively with a variety of stakeholders across diverse agencies to accomplish its vision of helping all people in the United States optimize their health and well-being across developmental life stages, with a continued emphasis on reducing health disparities and improving health equity and health literacy (HHS, 2020a). The development of <em>Healthy People 2030</em> is in progress, data-driven national objectives have been established, and updates can be found by visiting its website. Enacting the goals set by the LHIs and other health care reforms have contributed to continuous change in health care organizations and delivery in the United States.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s11">Advances in Technology and Genetics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Advances in technology and genetics have occurred rapidly during the past several decades. Sophisticated techniques and devices, such as robot assisted technology, have revolutionized treatments making it possible to perform many procedures and tests on an outpatient basis. Increased knowledge and understanding of genetics and genomics have resulted in expanded screening, diagnostic testing, and treatments for a variety of conditions (see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> for information on genetics and genomics and nursing practice implications; in addition, note that there are charts that focus upon <em>Genetics in Nursing Practice</em> throughout the book, which highlight various relevant genetic disorders).</p>
<p class="indent">In January 2015, President Obama announced the launching of the <em>Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI),</em> which aimed to leverage advances in research, technology, and policies to develop individualized plans of care to prevent and treat disease (Genetics Home Reference, 2020). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;precision medicine:&lt;/b&gt; using advances in research, technology, and policies to develop individualized plans of care to prevent and treat disease">Precision medicine</button></strong> is possible because of the recent development of biologic databases (e.g., human genome sequencing), technologic advances that can identify unique characteristics of individual people (e.g., genomics, cellular assay tests), and computer-driven systems that can mine and analyze data sets. The immediate goal of the PMI is to focus on preventing and curing cancers; however, there are long-term implications that hold promise for preventing and treating many other conditions and diseases (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Ciupka, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Health Informatics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The sophisticated communication systems that connect most parts of the world, with the capability of rapid storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information, have stimulated advances in health information technology (HIT). Using HIT to improve the quality, efficiency, or delivery of health care is an interdisciplinary field of study called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health informatics:&lt;/b&gt; the use of health information technology to improve the quality, efficiency, or delivery of health care">health informatics</button></strong><strong>.</strong> Key examples of recent advances in HIT include artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud technology, disease management technology, and improved operability of electronic health records (EHRs). The <em>Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform (TIGER)</em> initiative, now a subsidiary of the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS), provides expert panel reports and guidelines for incorporating HIT into nursing practice (HIMSS, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>International Classification of Diseases (ICD)</em> (WHO) launched its 10th iteration for use in the United States in 2015. The ICD-10 classifies diseases and conditions into nearly 70,000 codes. In June 2018, WHO released a version of ICD-11, which was presented to the World Health Assembly in 2019 for adoption by countries (WHO, 2018). Currently, the Centers for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Services (CMS, 2015) and most other major health insurance programs require utilization of ICD-10 codes when treatment is rendered for providers to claim reimbursement. This system provides for common nomenclature and tracking of the incidence and prevalence of various diseases and conditions globally. CMS (2020) also requires that clinicians and health care systems use EHRs; its final rule for stage 3 of the <em>EHR Incentive Program,</em> now known as the <em>Promoting Interoperability Program,</em> required that by 2018 providers use EHRs or face reductions in reimbursement.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these HIT advancements, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;telehealth:&lt;/b&gt; the use of technology to deliver health care, health information, or health education at a distance">telehealth</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bundle:&lt;/b&gt; a set of three to five evidence-based practices that, when implemented appropriately, can measurably improve patient outcomes"></button></strong>, which uses technology to deliver health care, health information, or health education at a distance, is being utilized by both individual clinicians and health care systems more and more frequently. In particular, home health services use telehealth to develop more individualized care plans for patients. One type of telehealth application uses <em>real-time communication,</em> characterized by an exchange of information between people at one point in time. For instance, a nurse practitioner in a rural clinic may consult with a specialist on a webcam about a patient&#x2019;s condition. Another type of telehealth application uses <em>store-and-forward,</em> characterized by transmission of digital <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" title="9"></span>images that may be retrieved and reviewed at later points in time (<a href="http://HealthIT.gov">HealthIT.gov</a>, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s12">Quality, Safety, and Evidence-Based Practice</h5>
<p class="nonindent">At the turn of the millennium, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2000) reported an alarming breakdown in quality control in the American health care system. The IOM report <em>To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System</em> (2000) noted that nearly 100,000 Americans died annually from preventable errors in hospitals, and many more suffered nonfatal injuries from errors. A subsequent IOM report, <em>Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century</em> (2001), described an inefficient, fragmented, health care system fraught with inequities and inaccessibility. It envisioned a reformed health care system that is evidence-based and systems oriented. Its proposed six aims for improvement included ensuring that patient care is safe, effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable (IOM, 2001). The following sections describe a series of key practices that are aimed at improving quality and safety and ensuring use of evidence-based practices (EBPs) within the U.S. health care system.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Principles of Evidence-Based Nursing Practice</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An <strong>evidence-based practice (EBP)</strong> is a best practice derived from valid and reliable research studies that also considers the health care setting, patient preferences and values, and clinical judgment. The facilitation of EBP involves identifying and evaluating current literature and research findings, and then incorporating these findings into patient care as a means of ensuring quality care (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">Melnyk &#x0026; Fineout-Overholt, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Evidence-Based Practice Bundles</p>
<p class="nonindent">The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) has developed numerous sets of readily implemented EBP sets for use by hospitals (IHI, 2020). These <strong>bundles</strong> include a set of three to five EBPs that, when implemented appropriately, can measurably improve patients&#x2019; outcomes. Many of these practices are within the scope of independent nursing practice. For instance, the IHI Ventilator Bundle advocates that the head of the bed should be elevated, and that oral care should be provided using chlorhexidine for all patients on ventilators (IHI, 2012; see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">EBP tools used for planning patient care may include not only bundles but also clinical guidelines, algorithms, care mapping, multidisciplinary action plans (MAPs), and clinical pathways. These tools are used to move patients toward predetermined, measurable outcomes. Algorithms are used more often in acute situations to determine a particular treatment based on patient information or response. Care maps, clinical guidelines, and MAPs (the most detailed of these tools) help to facilitate coordination of care and education throughout hospitalization and after discharge. Nurses who provide direct care have an important role in the development and use of these tools through participation in researching the literature and then developing, piloting, implementing, and revising the tools as needed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Quality and Safety Education for Nurses</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN)</strong> project was initially funded by the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to develop curricula that prepare future nurses with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSA) required to continuously improve the quality and safety of the health care system. In particular, nurses educated under QSEN concepts demonstrate the KSA consonant with competency in patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, EBP, quality improvement, safety, and informatics (<a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#bib91">QSEN, 2020</a>). Each of the Unit Openers in this book highlights a case study that demonstrates the application of QSEN competencies germane to pre-licensure nursing practice. <a href="#tt1-1">Table&#x00A0;1-1</a> highlights the QSEN definition of teamwork and collaboration and its associated KSA.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s13">Interprofessional Collaborative Practice</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The IOM report, <em>Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality</em> (IOM, 2003), challenged health professions education programs to integrate interdisciplinary core competencies into respective curricula to include patient-centered care, interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration, EBP, quality improvement, safety, and informatics. In response to this report, the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel (IPEC) published <em>Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice</em> (IPEC, 2011) with the goal to &#x201C;prepare all health professions students for deliberately working together with the common goal of building a safer and better patient-centered and community/population-oriented US health care system&#x201D; (p. 3). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;interprofessional collaborative practice:&lt;/b&gt; employing multiple health professionals to work together with patients, families, and communities to deliver best practices, thus ensuring best patient outcomes">Interprofessional collaborative practice</button></strong> involves employing multiple health professionals to work together with patients, families, and communities to deliver best practices, thus assuring best patient outcomes. In 2016, the IPEC updated this document by organizing the four original competencies under the essential domain of interprofessional collaboration; topics within this central domain, as displayed in <a href="#ff1-2">Figure&#x00A0;1-2</a><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bundle:&lt;/b&gt; a set of three to five evidence-based practices that, when implemented appropriately, can measurably improve patient outcomes"></button></strong>, include values/ethics for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page10" title="10"></span>interprofessional practice, roles and responsibilities for collaborative practice, interprofessional communication practices, and interprofessional teamwork and team-based practice (IPEC, 2016b). In addition, updates aimed to standardize language used among health care professionals to better facilitate interprofessional education, improve assessment and evaluation of outcomes, and more effectively meet contemporary health care goals, with a greater focus on population health. However, the updated guidelines maintain the IPEC&#x2019;s original vision &#x201C;that interprofessional collaborative practice is key to the safe, high-quality, patient-centered care desired by all&#x201D; (IPEC, 2016b, p. 4). Many of the end-of-chapter Critical Thinking Exercises that are presented throughout this book highlight the role of the nurse as a member of the interprofessional collaborative team.</p>
