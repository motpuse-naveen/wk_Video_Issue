<h4 class="h4" id="s40">Health Promotion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Health teaching and health promotion are linked by a common goal&#x2014;to encourage people to achieve as high a level of wellness as possible so that they can live maximally healthy lives and avoid preventable illnesses. The call for health promotion has become a cornerstone in health policy because of the need to control costs and reduce unnecessary sickness and death.</p>
<p class="indent">Health goals for the nation are established in the publication <em>Healthy People 2030.</em> The priorities from this initiative were identified as health promotion, health protection, and the use of preventive services. <em>Healthy People 2030</em> defines the current national health promotion and disease prevention initiative for the nation. Measurable goals for key health topics for the nation are shown in <a href="#ct3-2">Chart&#x00A0;3-2</a>. The overall goals are to (1) increase the quality and years of healthy life for people and (2) eliminate health disparities among various segments of the population (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Haskins, 2017</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib192">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The purpose of health promotion is to focus on the person&#x2019;s potential for wellness and to encourage appropriate alterations in personal habits, lifestyle, and environment in ways that reduce risks and enhance health and well-being. As discussed in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, health is viewed as a dynamic, ever-changing condition that enables people to function at an optimal potential at any given time, whereas wellness, a reflection of health, involves a conscious and deliberate attempt to maximize one&#x2019;s health. Health promotion is an active process&#x2014;that is, it is not something that can be prescribed or dictated. It is up to each person to decide whether to make changes to promote a higher level of wellness. Only the individual can make these choices.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s42">Health Promotion Models</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several health promotion models identify health-protecting behaviors and seek to explain what makes people engage in preventive behaviors. A health-protecting behavior is defined as any behavior performed by people, regardless of their actual or perceived health condition, for the purpose of promoting or maintaining their health, whether or not the behavior produces the desired outcome (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Murdaugh, Parsons, &#x0026; Pender, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Health Belief Model was designed to foster understanding of why some healthy people choose actions to prevent illness while others do not. Developed by Becker (1974), the model is based on the premise that four variables influence the selection and use of health promotion behaviors. Demographic and disease factors, the first variable, include patient characteristics, such as age, gender, education, employment, severity of illness or disability, and length of illness. Barriers, the second variable, are defined as factors leading to unavailability or difficulty in gaining access to a specific health promotion alternative. Resources, the third variable, encompass such factors as financial and social support. Perceptual factors, the fourth variable, consist of how the person views his or her health status, self-efficacy, and the perceived demands of the illness. Further research has demonstrated that these four variables have a positive correlation with a person&#x2019;s quality of life (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib162">Becker, Stuifbergen, Oh, et al., 1993</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another model, the Resource Model of Preventive Health Behavior, addresses the ways in which people use resources to promote health (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Murdaugh et al., 2019</a>). It is based on Social Learning Theory and emphasizes the importance of motivational factors in acquiring and sustaining health promotion behaviors. This model explores how cognitive-perceptual factors affect the person&#x2019;s view of the importance of health. It also examines perceived control of health, self-efficacy, health status, and the benefits and barriers to health-promoting behaviors. Nurse educators can use this model to assess how demographic variables, health behaviors, and social and health resources influence health promotion.</p>
<p class="indent">The Canadian health promotion initiative, Achieving Health for All, builds on the work of Lalonde (1977), in which four determinants of health&#x2014;human biology, environment, lifestyle, and the health care delivery system&#x2014;were identified. Determinants of health were defined as factors and conditions that have an influence on the health of individuals and communities. Since the 1970s, a total of 12 health determinants have been identified, and this number will continue to increase as population health research progresses. Determinants of health provide a framework for assessing and evaluating the population&#x2019;s health.</p>
<p class="indent">A model crafted to address organizational and individual health behavior change is the Awareness, Motivation, Skills, and Opportunity (AMSO) Model. The four components of this model focus on empowering people, understanding their individual priorities, and assisting them to change in personal ways that promote and maintain their optimal level of health. The dimensions of optimal health are physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual. This model promotes the process of creating and maintaining a balance among these five dimensions (O&#x2019;Donnell, 2017). Optimal health is a dynamic condition kept in balance by a combination of efforts to sustain awareness, maintain motivation, build skills, and have opportunities to practice positive health behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent">The Transtheoretical Model of Change, also known as the Stages of Change Model, is a framework that focuses on the motivation of a person to make decisions that promote healthy behavior change (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib171">DiClemente, 2007</a>). <a href="#tt3-2">Table&#x00A0;3-2</a> shows the six stages in the model. Research indicates that people working with health professionals progress through these stages of change (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib163">Blake, Stanulewicz, &#x0026; McGill, 2017</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Chen, Palmer, &#x0026; Lin, 2018</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib169">Das, Rouseff, Guzman, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib194">Wen, Li, Wang, et al., 2018</a>). Any of the models can serve as an organizing framework for clinical work and research that support the enhancement of health. Research suggests that the application of health promotion models, concepts, and frameworks increases the nurse&#x2019;s understanding of the health promotion behaviors of families and communities (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib190">St&#x2298;le, Nilsen, &#x0026; Joranger, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s43">Components of Health Promotion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Health promotion as an active process includes the following components: self-responsibility, nutritional awareness, stress reduction and management, and physical fitness.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Self-Responsibility</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Taking responsibility for oneself is the key to successful health promotion. The concept of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;self-responsibility:&lt;/b&gt; personal accountability for one&#x2019;s actions or behavior">self-responsibility</button></strong>, personal accountability for one&#x2019;s actions or behavior, is based on the understanding that individuals control their lives. Each person alone must make the choices that determine the health of his or her lifestyle. As more people recognize that lifestyle and behavior significantly affect health, they may assume responsibility for avoiding high-risk behaviors, such as smoking or use of any electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) (including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars), misuse of alcohol as well as prescription drugs and illegal drugs, overeating, driving under the influence, risky sexual practices, and other unhealthy habits. They may also assume responsibility for adopting routines that have been found to have a positive influence on health, such as engaging in regular exercise, wearing seat belts, and eating a healthy diet.</p>
<p class="indent">Various techniques have been used to encourage people to accept responsibility for their health, including public service announcements, educational programs, and reward systems. No one technique has been found to be superior to any other. Instead, self-responsibility for health promotion is individualized and depends on a person&#x2019;s desires and inner motivations. Health promotion programs are important tools for encouraging people to assume responsibility for their health and to develop behaviors that improve health.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Awareness</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nutrition, as a component of health promotion, has become the focus of considerable attention and publicity with the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States. A vast array of books and magazine articles address the topics of special diets; natural foods; and the hazards associated with certain substances, such as sugar, salt, cholesterol, trans fats, carbohydrates, artificial colors, and food additives. Research suggests that good nutrition is the single most significant factor in determining health status, longevity, and weight control (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">Nutritional awareness involves an understanding of the importance of a healthy diet that supplies all essential nutrients. Understanding the relationship between diet and disease is an important facet of a person&#x2019;s self-care. Some clinicians believe that a healthy diet is one that substitutes &#x201C;natural&#x201D; foods for processed and refined ones and reduces the intake of sugar, salt, fat, cholesterol, caffeine, alcohol, food additives, and preservatives.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> contains further information about the assessment of a person&#x2019;s nutritional status. It describes the physical signs indicating nutritional status, assessment of food intake (food record, 24-hour recall), the dietary guidelines presented in the MyPlate plan (see <a href="c04-sec04.xhtml#ff4-5">Fig.&#x00A0;4-5</a>), and calculation of body mass index (see <a href="c04-sec04.xhtml#tt4-1">Table&#x00A0;4-1</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Stress Reduction and Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stress management:&lt;/b&gt; behaviors and techniques used to strengthen a person&#x2019;s resources against stress">Stress management</button></strong> (behaviors and techniques used to strengthen a person&#x2019;s resources against stress), and stress reduction are important aspects of health promotion. Studies suggest the negative effects of stress on health and a cause-and-effect relationship between stress and infectious diseases, traumatic injuries (e.g., motor vehicle crashes), and some chronic illnesses. Stress has become inevitable in contemporary societies in which demands for productivity have become excessive. More and more emphasis is placed on encouraging people to manage stress appropriately and to reduce the pressures that are counterproductive. Research suggests that including techniques such as relaxation training, exercise, yoga, and modification of stressful situations in health promotion programs assist patients in dealing with stress (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib170">Davidson, Graham, Montross-Thomas, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib177">Hoogland, Lechner, Gonzalez, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib180">Kim, Lee, Lee, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib186">Morgan, Hourani, &#x0026; Tueller, 2017</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib187">Moscoso, Goese, Van Hyfte, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib197">Yadav, Yadav, Sarvottam, et al., 2017</a>). Further information on stress management, including health risk appraisal and stress reduction methods such as the Benson Relaxation Response, can be found in <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Physical Fitness</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;physical fitness:&lt;/b&gt; the condition of being physically healthy as a result of proper exercise and nutrition">Physical fitness</button></strong> (the condition of being physically healthy as a result of proper exercise and nutrition) is an important component of health promotion. Clinicians and researchers (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib179">Katsura, Takeda, Hara, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib183">Loprinzi &#x0026; Wade, 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib196">Wisnieski, Dalimente-Merckling, &#x0026; Robbins, 2019</a>) who have examined the relationship between health and physical fitness have found that a regular exercise program can promote health in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Improve the function of the circulatory system and the lungs</span></li>
<li><span>Decrease cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels</span></li>
<li><span>Decrease body weight by increasing calorie expenditure</span></li>
<li><span>Delay degenerative changes such as osteoporosis</span></li>
<li><span>Improve flexibility and overall muscle strength and endurance</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">An appropriate exercise program can have a positive effect on a person&#x2019;s performance capacity, appearance, and level of stress and fatigue, as well as their general state of physical, mental, and emotional health (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib173">Gilbertson, Mandelson, Hilovsky, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib184">Ma, West, Martin Ginis, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib188">Pettigrew, Burton, Farrier, et al., 2019</a>). An exercise program should be designed specifically for a given person, with consideration to age, physical condition, and any known cardiovascular or other risk factors. Exercise can be harmful if it is not started gradually and increased slowly in accordance with a person&#x2019;s response.</p>
<p class="indent">A significant amount of research suggests that people, by virtue of what they do or fail to do, influence their own health. Many diseases and disorders (e.g., diabetes, coronary artery disease, lung and colon cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, hypertension, cirrhosis, traumatic injury, HIV infection) have been closely related to lifestyle behaviors. To a large extent, a person&#x2019;s health status may be reflective of their lifestyle. For example, there is research examining how emerging adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease self-manage their chronic condition through the use of social support (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib178">Kamp, Luo, Holmstrom, et al., 2019</a>). (See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct3-3">Chart&#x00A0;3-3</a>.)</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Kamp, K. J., Luo, Z., Holmstrom, A., et al. (2019). Self-management through social support among emerging adults with inflammatory bowel disease. <em>Nursing Research</em>, <em>68</em>(4), 285&#x2013;295.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between two conceptualizations of social support, (the first type was received social support and the second type was perceived availability of social support) and the self-management behaviors by emerging adults ages 18 to 29 years with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In this quantitative, cross-sectional study the researchers administered an online survey to 61 emerging adults with IBD who lived in the United States. This convenience sample was recruited from ResearchMatch, Facebook, and through word of mouth. The participants completed a composite survey consisting of a demographic data form, the Inventory of Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood, the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors, the Medical Outcomes: Social Support Survey, the Medication Adherence Report Scale, and the Dietary Screener Questionnaire.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Of the 61 study participants, 90% were female and 10% were male. The sample was noted to be primarily single and educated. The major findings of the study indicated that emerging adults who had received high informational support reported greater adherence to the prescribed medication regimen as compared to participants who had received low informational support. Within this study the researchers controlled for medications, time since diagnosis, symptom frequency, and feeling in-between adolescence and adulthood. Neither one of the two types of social support were related to modification of participants&#x2019; diet.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses should be aware of the needs of emerging adults living with IBD. Often emerging adults allow others to make decisions about their health management. By providing informational support, the nurse may significantly influence their patients&#x2019; ability to more actively learn about themselves and how to manage their IBD through the use of group interventions and peer-to-peer mentoring. From this study it was noted that only the received social support was useful in the participants&#x2019; self-management behaviors for medication adherence. More research must be directed toward the benefits of received social support for effective self-management of chronic conditions faced by emerging adults.</p>
