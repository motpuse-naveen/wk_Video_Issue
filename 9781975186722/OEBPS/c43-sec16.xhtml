<h4 class="h4" id="s1847">Hepatitis E Virus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">It is believed that HEV is transmitted by the fecal&#x2013;oral route, principally through contaminated water in areas with poor sanitation. The incubation period is variable, estimated to range between 15 and 65 days. In general, hepatitis E resembles hepatitis A. It has a self-limited course with an abrupt onset. Jaundice is almost always present. Chronic forms do not develop.</p>
<p class="indent">Avoiding contact with the virus through good hygiene, including handwashing, is the major method of prevention of hepatitis E. The effectiveness of immune globulin in protecting against HEV is uncertain.</p>
