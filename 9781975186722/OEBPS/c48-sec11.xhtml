<h4 class="h4" id="s2165">Dialysis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Types of dialysis include HD, CRRT, and PD. Acute or urgent dialysis is indicated when there is a high and increasing level of serum potassium, fluid overload, or impending pulmonary edema, increasing acidosis, pericarditis, and advanced uremia. It may also be used to remove medications or toxins (poisoning or medication overdose) from the blood or for edema or hypertension that does not respond to other treatment, and hyperkalemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic or maintenance dialysis is indicated in advanced CKD and ESKD in the following instances: the presence of uremic signs and symptoms affecting all body systems (nausea and vomiting, severe anorexia, increasing lethargy, mental confusion), hyperkalemia, fluid overload not responsive to diuretics and fluid restriction, and a general lack of well-being. An urgent indication for dialysis in patients with kidney disease is pericardial friction rub, which is indicative of uremic pericarditis.</p>
<p class="indent">The decision to initiate dialysis should be reached only after thoughtful discussion among the patient, family, primary provider, and other health care team members. The nurse can assist the patient and family by answering their questions, clarifying the information provided, and supporting their decision.</p>
<p class="indent">Successful kidney transplantation eliminates the need for dialysis. Not only is the quality of life much improved in patients with ESKD who undergo transplantation, but physiologic function is improved as well. Patients who undergo kidney transplantation from living donors before dialysis is initiated (preemptive transplant) generally have longer survival of the transplanted kidney than patients who receive transplantation after dialysis treatment is initiated (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Bunnapradist, Abdalla, &#x0026; Reddy, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2166">Hemodialysis (HD)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">HD is used for patients who are acutely ill and require short-term dialysis for days to weeks until kidney function resumes, as in patients with AKI, and for patients with advanced CKD and ESKD who require long-term or permanent RRT. HD prevents death but does not cure kidney disease and does not compensate for the loss of endocrine or metabolic activities of the kidneys. Approximately 62.7% of patients requiring long-term RRT are on chronic HD (USRDS, 2019). Most patients receive intermittent HD that involves treatments three times a week with an average treatment duration of 3 to 4 hours in an outpatient setting. HD can also be performed at home by the patient and a caregiver. See later discussion on home HD.</p>
<p class="indent">The objectives of HD are to extract toxic nitrogenous substances from the blood and to remove excess fluid. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dialyzer:&lt;/b&gt; artificial kidney; contains a semipermeable membrane through which particles of a certain size can pass">dialyzer</button></strong> (also referred to as an artificial kidney) is a synthetic semipermeable membrane through which blood is filtered to remove uremic toxins and a desired amount of fluid. In HD, the blood, laden with toxins and nitrogenous wastes, is diverted from the patient to a machine via the use of a blood <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1578" title="1578"></span>pump to the dialyzer, where toxins are filtered from the blood and the cleansed blood is returned to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Diffusion, osmosis, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ultrafiltration:&lt;/b&gt; process whereby water is removed from the blood by means of a pressure gradient between the patient&#x2019;s blood and the dialysate">ultrafiltration</button></strong> are the principles on which HD is based (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>). The toxins and wastes in the blood are removed by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diffusion:&lt;/b&gt; the process by which solutes move from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration; does not require expenditure of energy">diffusion</button></strong>&#x2014;that is, they move from an area of higher concentration in the blood to an area of lower concentration in the dialysate. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dialysate:&lt;/b&gt; the electrolyte solution that circulates through the dialyzer in hemodialysis and through the peritoneal membrane in peritoneal dialysis">dialysate</button></strong> is a solution that circulates through the dialyzer, made up of all the electrolytes in their ideal extracellular concentrations. The electrolyte level in the patient&#x2019;s blood can be brought under control by properly adjusting the electrolytes in the dialysate solution. The semipermeable membrane impedes the diffusion of large molecules, such as RBCs and proteins.</p>
<p class="indent">Excess fluid is removed from the blood by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osmosis:&lt;/b&gt; the process by which fluid moves across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration; the process continues until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane">osmosis</button></strong>, in which water moves from an area of low concentration potential (the blood) to an area of high concentration potential (the dialysate bath). In <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ultrafiltration:&lt;/b&gt; process whereby water is removed from the blood by means of a pressure gradient between the patient&#x2019;s blood and the dialysate">ultrafiltration</button></strong>, fluid moves under high pressure to an area of lower pressure. This process is much more efficient than osmosis for fluid removal and is accomplished by applying negative pressure (a suctioning-type force) to the dialysis membrane. Because patients with ESKD requiring dialysis usually cannot excrete enough water, this force is necessary to remove fluid to achieve fluid balance.</p>
<p class="indent">The body&#x2019;s buffer system is maintained using a dialysate bath made up of bicarbonate (most common) or acetate, which is metabolized to form bicarbonate. The anticoagulant heparin is given to keep blood from clotting in the extracorporeal dialysis circuit. Cleansed blood is returned to the body with the goal of removing fluid, balancing electrolytes, and managing acidosis (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hellebrand, Allen, &#x0026; Hoffman, 2017</a>).</p>

<img src="images/ff48-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff48-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;48-3 &#x2022;</span> HD system. Blood from the arteriovenous fistula or graft is pumped (<strong>A</strong>) into a dialyzer, where it flows through the synthetic capillary tubes (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B</button></strong>), which act as the semipermeable membrane (<em>inset</em>). The dialysate, which has a particular chemical composition, flows into the dialyzer around the capillary tubes that the blood flows through. The waste products in the blood diffuse across the semipermeable membrane into the dialysate solution and flows out to the drain.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2167">Dialyzers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dialyzers are hollow-fiber devices containing thousands of tiny capillary tubes that carry the blood through the artificial kidney. The tubes are porous and act as a semipermeable membrane, allowing toxins, fluid, and electrolytes to pass across the membrane. The constant flow of the solution maintains the concentration gradient to facilitate the exchange of wastes from the blood across the semipermeable membrane into the dialysate solution, where they are removed and discarded (see <a href="#ff48-3">Fig.&#x00A0;48-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dialyzers have undergone many technologic changes in performance and biocompatibility. High-flux dialysis uses highly permeable membranes to increase the clearance of low- and mid&#x2013;molecular-weight molecules. These special membranes are used with higher than traditional rates of flow for the blood entering and exiting the dialyzer (500 to 550 mL/min). High-flux dialysis increases the efficiency of treatments while shortening their duration and reducing the need for heparin.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2168">Vascular Access</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Access to the patient&#x2019;s vascular system must be established to allow blood to be removed, cleansed, and returned to the patient&#x2019;s vascular system at the rapid rates of 300 and 500 mL/min. Several types of access can be surgically created or placed during procedures performed in interventional radiology suites or at the bedside.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vascular Access Devices</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate access to the patient&#x2019;s circulation for acute HD is achieved by inserting a double-lumen, noncuffed, large-bore catheter into the right or left internal jugular or femoral vein of either leg by the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant (see <a href="#ff48-4">Fig.&#x00A0;48-4</a>). The subclavian vein is rarely used as there is an increased risk for central stenosis (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Pryor &#x0026; Brouwer-Maier, 2017</a>). This method of vascular access involves some risk (e.g., hematoma, bleeding, pneumothorax, infection, thrombosis of the vein, inadequate flow). The catheter is removed when no longer needed (e.g., because the patient&#x2019;s condition has improved or another type of permanent access has been established). Double-lumen, cuffed catheters may also be inserted, usually by either a surgeon or interventional radiologist, into the internal jugular vein of the patient. Because these catheters have cuffs under the skin, the insertion site heals, sealing the wound and reducing the risk for ascending infection. This feature makes these catheters safe for longer-term use. However, infection rates remain high, and sepsis continues to be a common cause for hospital admission (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Pryor &#x0026; Brouwer-Maier, 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Arteriovenous Fistula</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The preferred method of permanent vascular access for dialysis is an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;arteriovenous fistula:&lt;/b&gt; type of vascular access for dialysis which is created by surgically connecting an artery to a vein">arteriovenous fistula</button></strong> (AVF) that is created surgically (usually in the forearm) by anastomosing (joining) an artery to a vein, either side to side or end to side (see <a href="#ff48-5">Fig.&#x00A0;48-5</a>A). Needles are inserted into the vessel to obtain blood flow which is adequate to pass through the dialyzer. The arterial segment of the fistula is used for outflow to the dialyzer and the venous segment for reinfusion of the dialyzed blood. This access will need time (at least 3 months) to &#x201C;mature&#x201D; before it can be used. As the AVF matures, the venous segment dilates due to the increased blood flow coming directly from the artery. Once sufficiently dilated, it will then accommodate two large-bore (14-, 15-, or 16-gauge) needles that are inserted for each dialysis treatment. The patient is encouraged to perform hand exercises (e.g., squeezing a rubber ball) to increase the size of these vessels to accommodate the large-bore needles. Once established, this access has the longest useful life and thus is considered the best option for vascular access for the patient requiring ongoing HD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Inglese, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Arteriovenous Graft</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;arteriovenous graft:&lt;/b&gt; type of surgically created vascular access for dialysis by which a piece of biologic, semibiologic, or synthetic graft material connects the patient&#x2019;s artery to a vein">arteriovenous graft</button></strong> can be created by subcutaneously interposing a biologic, semibiologic, or synthetic graft material between an artery and vein (see <a href="#ff48-5">Fig.&#x00A0;48-5</a>B). Usually, a graft is created when the patient&#x2019;s vessels are not suitable for creation of an AVF. Patients with compromised vascular systems (e.g., from diabetes) often require a graft because their native vessels may not be suitable for creation of an AVF. Grafts are usually placed in the arm but may be placed in the thigh or chest wall. Stenosis, infection, and thrombosis are the most common complications of this access. It is not at all uncommon to see a dialysis patient with numerous &#x201C;old&#x201D; or &#x201C;nonfunctioning&#x201D; accesses present on their arms. The patient is asked to identify the current access in use, and it is assessed carefully and regularly for the presence of a bruit and thrill.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Failure of the permanent dialysis access (fistula or graft) accounts for many hospital admissions of patients undergoing chronic HD. Thus, protection of the access is of high priority. Although limb alert bracelets (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Sturdivant &#x0026; Johnson, 2019</a>) are ideal to identify the access extremity, posted signs are also a good safety alert. The sign should state, &#x201C;No lab draws, IVs, or blood pressures on access arm.&#x201D;</em></p></div>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2169">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although HD can prolong life, it does not alter the natural course of the underlying CKD, nor does it completely replace kidney function. The CKD complications previously discussed will continue to worsen and require treatment. With the initiation of dialysis, disturbances of lipid metabolism are accelerated and contribute to cardiovascular complications. Heart failure, coronary artery disease, angina, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease may occur and can incapacitate the patient. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients receiving dialysis as well as for patients with CKD.</p>
<p class="indent">Many complications result from both the underlying ESKD and the HD treatments. The anemia of ESKD is compounded by blood loss during HD. Gastric ulcers may result from the physiologic stress of chronic illness, medication, and preexisting medical conditions (e.g., diabetes). Patients with uremia often report a metallic taste and nausea. Vomiting may occur during the HD treatment when rapid fluid shifts and hypotension occur. These contribute to the malnutrition seen in patients on dialysis. Disordered calcium metabolism and renal osteodystrophy can result in bone pain and fractures, interfering with mobility. As time on dialysis continues, calcification of major blood vessels has been reported and linked to hypertension and other vascular complications. Phosphorus deposits in the skin can occur and cause itching.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people undergoing HD experience major sleep problems that further complicate their overall health status. Early-morning or late-afternoon dialysis may be a risk factor for developing sleep disturbances.</p>
<p class="indent">Other complications of dialysis may include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Episodes of shortness of breath often occur as fluid accumulates between dialysis treatments.</span></li>
<li><span>Hypotension may occur during the treatment as fluid is removed. Nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and dizziness are common signs of hypotension.</span></li>
<li><span>Painful muscle cramping may occur, usually late in dialysis as fluid and electrolytes rapidly leave the extracellular space.</span></li>
<li><span>Exsanguination may occur if blood lines separate or dialysis needles become dislodged.</span></li>
<li><span>Arrhythmias may result from electrolyte and pH changes or from removal of antiarrhythmic medications during dialysis.</span></li>
<li><span>Air embolism is very rare since the advent of venous air detectors, but can occur if air enters the vascular system.</span></li>
<li><span>Chest pain may occur in patients with anemia or arteriosclerotic heart disease.</span></li>
<li><span>Dialysis disequilibrium results from cerebral fluid shifts. Signs and symptoms include headache, nausea and vomiting, restlessness, decreased level of consciousness, and seizures. It is rare and more likely to occur in AKI or when BUN levels are very high (exceeding 150 mg/dL) and the patient is dialyzed with high blood and dialysate flows. Therefore, short treatments with low blood and dialysate flow rates are prescribed (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3507">Hellebrand et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2170"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients undergoing outpatient HD are at high risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to comorbidities (e.g., hypertension), their relatively suppressed immune status, and more frequent hospitalizations (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3562">Wu, Li, Zhu, et al., 2020</a>). Travel to an outpatient dialysis center three times a week also increases their risk of contracting the virus (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Ajaimy &#x0026; Melamed, 2020</a>). Findings from a retrospective, single-center study of 49 patients on HD compared to 52 patients without kidney disease all hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China, reported that the main symptoms of fever and cough were less prevalent in patients who were undergoing HD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Wu et al., 2020</a>). Patients on HD were also more likely to be admitted to intensive care, need ventilator support, and had a higher mortality rate compared to controls (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Wu et al., 2020</a>). These early findings suggest that patients receiving HD are not only at greater risk for COVID-19, they are also at risk for not being recognized as infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage, when they may be amenable to treatment. These findings also suggest that patients on HD who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are more acutely ill and at greater risk for death compared to patients not on HD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Wu et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2171">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse in the dialysis unit has an important role in monitoring, supporting, assessing, and educating the patient. During HD, the patient, the dialyzer, and the dialysate bath require constant monitoring because numerous complications are possible, including clotting of the dialysis tubing or dialyzer, air embolism, inadequate or excessive fluid removal, hypotension, cramping, vomiting, blood leaks, contamination, and access complications. Nursing care of the patient and maintenance of the vascular access device are especially important and are discussed in the Special Considerations: Nursing Management of the Patient on Dialysis Who Is Hospitalized section.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many medications are removed from the blood during HD. Therefore, dosage or timing of medication administration may require adjustment. Medications that are water soluble are readily removed during HD treatment, and those that are fat soluble or adhere to other substances (like albumin) are not dialyzed out very well. This is the reason some drug overdoses are treated with emergency HD and others are not.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1580</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1581" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1581">p. 1581</span></div>
<p class="indent">Patients undergoing HD who require medications (e.g., cardiac glycosides, antibiotic agents, antiarrhythmic medications, antihypertensive agents) are monitored closely to ensure that blood and tissue levels of these medications are maintained without toxic accumulation. Antihypertensive therapy, often part of the regimen of patients on dialysis, is one example when communication, education, and evaluation can make a difference in patient outcomes. The patient must know when&#x2014;and when not&#x2014;to take the medication. For example, if an antihypertensive agent is taken on a dialysis day, hypotension may occur during dialysis, causing dangerously low blood pressure. Many medications that are taken once daily should be administered after the dialysis treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Nutritional and Fluid Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Diet is important for patients on HD. Goals of nutritional therapy are to minimize uremic symptoms and fluid and electrolyte imbalances; to maintain good nutritional status through adequate protein, calorie, vitamin, and mineral intake; and to enable the patient to eat a palatable and enjoyable diet. Restriction of fluid is also part of the dietary prescription because fluid accumulation may occur, leading to fluid volume excess, heart failure, and pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="indent">With the initiation of HD, the patient usually requires some restriction of dietary sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and fluid intake. Close collaboration with a renal dietitian is essential in helping the patient make good food choices. Protein intake is restricted to about 1.2 g/kg ideal body weight per day; therefore, protein must be of high-biologic quality. Sodium is usually restricted to 2 g/day; the fluid prescription is individualized based on residual urine output (generally 1000 to 1500 mL/day). The goal for patients on HD is to keep their interdialytic (between dialysis treatments) weight gain less than 4% of their estimated dry weight (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Gonyea, 2017</a>). Potassium restriction depends on the amount of residual renal function and the frequency of dialysis.</p>

</div>
<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Resilience in Patients Receiving Dialysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Kim, E., Lee, Y., &#x0026; Chang, S. (2019). How do patients on hemodialysis perceive and overcome hemodialysis?: Concept development of the resilience of patients on hemodialysis. <em>Nephrology Nursing Journal</em>, <em>46</em>(5), 521&#x2013;530.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This qualitative study was designed to identify and conceptualize the concept of resilience in patients receiving HD.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, called the theoretical phase, a literature review was undertaken and a definition of the resilience of patients on HD was constructed. In the fieldwork phase, interviews were held with 10 patients. Qualitative data from the 10 interviews were analyzed for patterns to identify attributes of resilience for patients on HD. The last phase compared the theoretical definition with the data collected in the fieldwork phase.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purposive patient sample included 10 participants from one HD center at a university hospital in Korea who were chosen by nurses with expertise in HD who assessed the patients to have characteristics of resilience. The length of time participants had been on HD ranged between 1 and 10 years, and 60% were female. Through in-depth interviews, the concept of the resilience of patients on HD was found to have three dimensions: a willingness to actively solve problems, building daily routine strategies continuing roles as a family member and asserting the will to grow through overcoming HD; an acceptance of the HD situation, maintaining the homeostasis of the body and deliberating on death; and a positive self-perception and positively reinterpreting human relationships.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse should assess and reinforce positive coping strategies that patients are using to cope with the issues encountered with the HD routine and change in lifestyle. By identifying the concept of resilience, nurses can encourage patients to use their positive coping skills to manage the financial, psychosocial, and medical challenges they may experience. The findings of this study could be used as a foundation for intervention strategies that incorporate the inventory of patients&#x2019; strengths.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Dietary restriction is an unwelcome change in lifestyle for many patients with ESKD. Patients can feel stigmatized in social situations because there may be few food choices available for their diet. If the restrictions are ignored, life-threatening complications, such as hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema, may result. Thus, the patient may feel punished for responding to basic human drives to eat and drink. The nurse and renal dietitian who care for a patient with symptoms or complications resulting from dietary indiscretion must avoid harsh, judgmental, or punitive tones when communicating with them. Regular education with reinforcement is needed to achieve these difficult changes in lifestyle.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Meeting Psychosocial Needs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients requiring long-term HD, as they engage in psychosocial adaptation, tend to feel mired in a cyclical routine (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3547">Lin, Han, &#x0026; Pan, 2015</a>). They often have financial problems, difficulty holding a job, waning sexual desire and impotence, clinical depression, and fear of dying. Younger patients worry about marriage, having children, and the burden that they bring to their families. The regimented lifestyle that frequent dialysis treatments and restrictions in food and fluid intake impose can be demoralizing to the patient and family. Researchers have studied how patients on HD perceive and cope with the treatment by developing resilience (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3545">Kim, Lee, &#x0026; Chang, 2019</a>). (See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct48-8">Chart&#x00A0;48-8</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Dialysis alters the lifestyle of the patient and family. The amount of time required for dialysis and primary provider visits and being chronically ill can create conflict, frustration, guilt, and depression. It may be difficult for the patient, spouse, and family to express anger and negative feelings.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse needs to give the patient and family the opportunity to express feelings of anger and concern about the limitations that the disease and treatment impose, possible financial problems, and job insecurity. If anger is not expressed, it may be directed inward and lead to depression, despair, and attempts at suicide; however, if anger is projected outward to other people, it may damage family relationships.</p>

She is admitted to the medical unit where you work as a staff nurse with fluid retention and dyspnea. It is reported that B.J. had been a &#x201C;no show&#x201D; at the dialysis center for at least the past week. As part of her therapeutic plan, she is supposed to be dialyzed while in the hospital. As you enter her room to prepare her for transport to the hospital&#x2019;s dialysis center, you find B.J. humming to herself, clapping her hands, and smiling. When you explain to her that she is going to be transported to the dialysis center, she says &#x201C;Honey, I am not going anywhere. I want to see Jesus. It is my time and I am ready to see the Lord.&#x201D; You have heard from the medical social worker that this is not B.J.&#x2019;s first admission to the hospital for poor adherence to her outpatient dialysis treatment. During past hospitalizations, her three adult daughters would visit her together and effectively cajole her into receiving dialysis treatments. Reportedly, the daughters have a loving and supportive relationship with each other and their mother. However, there is an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within your community and the hospital has responded with a no-visitor policy throughout the facility, so B.J.&#x2019;s daughters may not visit her.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The principle of autonomy is considered sacrosanct. Patients have the right to refuse treatments, even if those treatments are life-saving. However, in this particular instance, B.J. could be delirious as a manifestation of her poorly managed CKD. If she is delirious, it may be determined that she lacks the capacity to make her own decisions. Her daughters might be her surrogates and legally responsible to make health care decisions for her. However, her daughters&#x2019; prohibition to visit her while she is hospitalized hampers their ability to discuss her options with her and gain her assent for treatment.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>). Can the principle of beneficence and wishing to &#x201C;do good&#x201D; for B.J. trump her autonomous right to refuse treatment? Can she be forced to undergo dialysis?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What if it is determined that B.J. lacks the capacity to make informed decisions? On the contrary, what if it is determined that B.J. is not delirious and has the capacity to refuse to be dialyzed? Describe methods that you might employ to engage B.J.&#x2019;s daughters so that they might be able to communicate with her and with each other as a family unit.</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be mobilized to be of assistance to B.J., her daughters, and the health care team so that a treatment plan that preserves B.J.&#x2019;s dignity during this pandemic might be devised?</p>

<p class="indent">Although these feelings are normal in this situation, they are often profound. Counseling and psychotherapy may be useful. All patients receiving dialysis should be screened for depression using a standard screening tool such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) or the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3557">Shirazian, Grant, Aina, et al., 2017</a>). Depression may require treatment. Referring the patient and family to a mental health provider with expertise in the care of patients receiving dialysis may also be helpful. Clinical nurse specialists, psychologists, and social workers may be helpful in assisting the patient and family to cope with the changes brought about by kidney disease and its treatment by encouraging the development of resilience (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3545">Kim et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Lieser, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The sense of loss that the patient experiences cannot be underestimated because every aspect of a &#x201C;normal life&#x201D; is disrupted. Some patients use denial to deal with the array of medical problems (e.g., infections, hypertension, anemia, neuropathy). Staff who are tempted to label the patient as nonadherent must consider the impact of kidney disease and its treatment on the patient and family and the coping strategies that they may use.</p>
<p class="indent">Palliative care principles that focus on symptom control are becoming increasingly important as greater attention is focused on quality-of-life issues. Patients and their families are encouraged to discuss end-of-life options and to develop advanced directives or living wills (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Molzahn &#x0026; Schick-Makaroff, 2017</a>) (see <a href="#ct48-9">Chart&#x00A0;48-9</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Preparing a patient for HD is essential. Assessment helps identify the learning needs of the patient and family members. In many cases, the patient is discharged home before learning needs and readiness to learn can be thoroughly evaluated; therefore, hospital-based nurses, dialysis staff, and home health nurses must work together to provide appropriate education that meets the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s changing needs and readiness to learn (see <a href="#ct48-10">Chart&#x00A0;48-10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The diagnosis of ESKD and the need for dialysis is a big adjustment for the patient and family. In addition, many patients with ESKD have clinical depression, and chronic uremia contributes to a shortened attention span, a decreased level of concentration, and altered perception. Therefore, education must occur in brief, 10- to 15-minute sessions, with time added for clarification, repetition, reinforcement, and questions from the patient and family. The nurse needs to convey a nonjudgmental attitude to enable the patient and family to discuss options and their feelings about those options. Team conferences are helpful for sharing information and providing every team member the opportunity to discuss the needs of the patient and family.</p>

<p class="h7">Home Hemodialysis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients who undergo HD do so in an outpatient setting, but home HD is an option for some. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 2% of patients receiving RRT were on home HD (USRDS, 2019). Home HD requires a highly motivated patient who is willing to take responsibility for the procedure and is able to adjust each treatment to meet the body&#x2019;s changing needs. It also requires the commitment and cooperation of a caregiver to assist the patient. However, many patients are not comfortable imposing on others and do not wish to subject family members to the feeling that their home is being turned into a clinic. The health care team never forces a patient to use home HD, because this treatment requires changes in the home and family. Home HD must be the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s decision (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Harwood &#x0026; Dominski, 2017</a>). However, more patients needing RRT are being encouraged to reassess the home dialysis option as this modality allows the patient to self-isolate and to avoid having to enter an HD center thrice weekly, thus lowering the risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Ajaimy &#x0026; Melamed, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient undergoing home HD and the caregiver assisting that patient must be trained to prepare, operate, and disassemble the dialysis machine; maintain and clean the equipment; administer medications (e.g., heparin) into the machine lines; and handle emergency problems (HD dialyzer rupture, electrical or mechanical problems, hypotension, shock, and seizures) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Harwood &#x0026; Dominski, 2017</a>). Because home HD places primary responsibility for the treatment on the patient and the family member, they must understand and be capable of performing all aspects of the HD procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Before home HD is initiated, the home environment, household and community resources, and ability and willingness of the patient and family to carry out this treatment are assessed. The home is surveyed to see if electrical outlets, plumbing facilities, and storage space are adequate. Modifications may be needed to enable the patient and caregiver to perform dialysis safely and to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p class="indent">Once home HD is initiated, the home health nurse must visit periodically to evaluate adherence with the recommended techniques, to assess the patient for complications, to reinforce previous education, and to provide feedback and reassurance.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The health care team&#x2019;s goal in treating patients with CKD is to maximize their vocational potential, functional status, and quality of life (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Browne &#x0026; Johnstone, 2017</a>). To facilitate renal rehabilitation, appropriate follow-up and monitoring by members of the health care team (physicians, dialysis nurses, renal dietitian, social worker, psychologist, home health nurses, and others as appropriate) are essential to early identification and resolution of problems. Many patients with CKD can resume relatively normal lives, doing the things that are important to them: traveling, exercising, working, or actively participating in family activities. If appropriate interventions are available early in the course of dialysis, the potential for better health improves, and the patient can remain active in family and community life. Outcome goals for renal rehabilitation include employment for those able to work, improved physical functioning of all patients, improved understanding about adaptation and options for living well, increased control over the effects of kidney disease and dialysis, and resumption of activities enjoyed before dialysis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2172"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CRRT may be indicated for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease who are too clinically unstable for traditional HD, for patients with fluid overload secondary to oliguric (low urine output) kidney disease, and for patients whose kidneys cannot handle their acutely high metabolic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1584" title="1584"></span>or nutritional needs. Some forms of CRRT may not require dialysis machines or dialysis personnel to carry out the procedures and can be initiated quickly in the critical-care unit. Several types of CRRT are available and widely used in critical-care units (see <a href="#ff48-6">Fig.&#x00A0;48-6</a>). The methods are similar, as they require access to the circulation and blood to pass through an artificial filter. A hemofilter (an extremely porous blood filter containing a semipermeable membrane) is used in all types.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2173"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is often used to manage AKI. Blood from a double-lumen venous catheter is pumped (using a small blood pump) through a hemofilter and then returned to the patient through a different lumen of the same catheter (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>). CVVH provides <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ultrafiltration:&lt;/b&gt; process whereby water is removed from the blood by means of a pressure gradient between the patient&#x2019;s blood and the dialysate">ultrafiltration</button></strong> (continuous slow fluid removal); therefore, hemodynamic effects are mild and better tolerated by patients with unstable conditions. CVVH requires a dual-lumen venous catheter, a specialized machine, and critical-care nurses trained in management of the therapy who can set up, initiate, maintain, and terminate the system. Many hospitals have developed a collaborative approach to managing the CVVH therapy between the critical-care and nephrology nursing staff (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2174"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) is similar to CVVH. Blood is pumped from a double-lumen venous catheter through a hemofilter and returned to the patient through a different lumen of the same catheter. In addition to the benefits of ultrafiltration, CVVHD uses a concentration gradient to facilitate the removal of uremic toxins and fluid by adding a dialysate solution into the jacket of the dialyzer, surrounding the blood in the fibers. Hemodynamic effects are usually mild and critical-care nurses can set up, initiate, maintain, and terminate the system with the support of the nephrology nursing staff (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2175">Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of PD are to remove toxic substances and metabolic wastes and to reestablish normal fluid and electrolyte balance. PD may be the treatment of choice for patients with kidney disease who are unable or unwilling to undergo HD or kidney transplantation. Patients who are susceptible to the rapid fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic changes that occur during HD experience fewer of these problems with the slower rate of PD. Therefore, patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease, many older patients, and those who may be at risk for adverse effects of systemic heparin are likely candidates for PD. In addition, severe hypertension, heart failure, and pulmonary edema not responsive to usual treatment regimens have been successfully treated with PD. Fewer than 8% of patients with ESKD receive PD as their treatment modality (USRDS, 2019). <a href="#ct48-11">Chart&#x00A0;48-11</a> discusses suitability for PD.</p>
<p class="indent">In PD, the peritoneal membrane that covers the abdominal organs and lines the abdominal wall serves as the semipermeable membrane. Sterile dialysate fluid, containing dextrose and electrolytes, is introduced into the peritoneal cavity <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1585" title="1585"></span>through an abdominal catheter at established intervals. Once the sterile solution is in the peritoneal cavity, uremic toxins such as urea and creatinine begin to be cleared from the blood. Diffusion of these solutes occurs as waste products move from an area of higher concentration (the bloodstream) to an area of lesser concentration (the dialysate fluid) through a semipermeable membrane (the peritoneum). This movement of solute from the blood into the dialysate fluid is called clearance. Because substances cross the peritoneal membrane at different rates, adjustments in solution dwell time and volume are made to facilitate the process of clearance. Ultrafiltration occurs in PD through an osmotic gradient created by using a dialysate fluid with a higher glucose concentration than the blood.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Considerations for Peritoneal Dialysis</strong></p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="BoxpPARA">Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) is not suitable for all patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), it is a viable therapy for those who can perform self-care and fluid exchanges and fit therapy into their own routines. Often, patients report having more energy and feeling healthier once they begin PD. Nurses can be instrumental in helping patients with ESKD find the dialysis therapy that best suits their lifestyle. Those considering PD need to understand the advantages and disadvantages along with the indications and contraindications for this form of therapy.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Freedom from a hemodialysis (HD) machine</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>More control over daily activities</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Opportunities to eat a more liberal diet than allowed with HD; usually increased fluid allowance; improved serum hematocrit values; improved blood pressure control; avoidance of venipuncture; and improved sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Need for dialysis 7 days a week</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Dietary alterations related to protein and potassium losses. Patients may be encouraged to increase the intake of protein and potassium in the diet due to these losses with PD fluid exchanges</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Indications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Patient&#x2019;s willingness, motivation, and ability to perform dialysis at home</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Strong family or community support system (essential for success), particularly if the patient is an older adult</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Special problems with long-term HD, such as dysfunctional or failing vascular access devices, excessive thirst, severe hypertension, post-dialysis headaches, and severe anemia requiring frequent transfusion</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Interim therapy while awaiting kidney transplantation</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>ESKD secondary to diabetes because hypertension, uremia, and hyperglycemia are easier to manage with PD than with HD</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Contraindications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Adhesions from previous surgery (adhesions reduce clearance of solutes) or systemic inflammatory disease</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Chronic backache and preexisting disc disease, which could be aggravated by the continuous pressure of dialysis fluid in the abdomen</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Severe arthritis or poor hand strength necessitating assistance in performing the exchange. However, patients who are blind or partially blind and those with other physical limitations can learn to perform PD</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2176">Procedure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As with other forms of treatment, the decision to begin PD is made by the patient and family in consultation with the nephrologist. With PD, the patient generally has ESKD and will need to receive ongoing treatments.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preparing the Patient</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse&#x2019;s preparation of the patient and family for PD depends upon the assessment of the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status, mental status, previous experience with dialysis, and understanding of and familiarity with the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse and surgeon or interventional radiologist or nephrologist explain the procedure to the patient. The nurse assists the provider in obtaining signed consent for insertion of the catheter. Baseline vital signs, weight, and serum electrolyte levels are recorded. Evaluation of the abdomen for placement of the catheter exit site is done to facilitate self-care. Typically, the catheter is placed on the nondominant side to allow the patient easier access to the catheter connection site when exchanges are done. The patient is instructed to empty the bladder and bowel to reduce the risk of puncture of internal organs during the insertion procedure. A prophylactic antibiotic agent will be given to prevent infection. The peritoneal catheter can be inserted in interventional radiology, in the operating room, or, rarely, at the bedside. Depending on the situation, this will need to be explained to the patient and family.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preparing the Equipment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to assembling the equipment to administer PD, the nurse consults with the physician to determine the concentration of dialysate to be used and the medications to be added. Heparin may be added to prevent fibrin formation and resultant occlusion of the peritoneal catheter. Potassium chloride may be prescribed to prevent hypokalemia. Antibiotic agents may be added to treat <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;peritonitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity">peritonitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the peritoneal membrane) caused by infection. Insulin is rarely added to PD fluid due to widespread use of subcutaneous insulin pumps and sliding scales (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>). Aseptic technique is imperative whenever medications are added to the PD solution. In a hospital setting, to prevent contamination, a pharmacist generally adds all medications to the dialysate bags in the pharmacy under a laminar flow hood. In the home setting, the nurse instructs the patient or family on how to aseptically add medications to PD fluid.</p>
<p class="indent">The dialysate is warmed to body temperature to prevent patient discomfort and abdominal pain and to dilate the vessels of the peritoneum to increase urea clearance. Solutions that are too cold cause pain, cramping, and vasoconstriction and reduce clearance. Dry heating (heating cabinet, incubator, or heating pad) is recommended. Methods that are never recommended include soaking the bags of solution in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1586" title="1586"></span>warm water (introduces bacteria to the exterior of the bags of solution and increases the chance of peritonitis) and using a microwave oven to heat the fluid (increases the danger of burning the peritoneum) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately before initiating dialysis, using aseptic technique, the nurse assembles the dialysate with attached tubing and drainage bag. All PD dialysate fluid, tubing, and drainage bags are manufactured as closed systems and no spiking of solution is needed. The tubing is primed with the prepared dialysate to prevent air from entering the catheter and peritoneal cavity, which would cause abdominal discomfort and interfere with instillation and drainage of the fluid.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Inserting the Catheter</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In most cases, the peritoneal catheter is inserted in the operating room or radiology suite to maintain surgical asepsis and minimize the risk of contamination. Catheters for long-term use are usually soft and flexible and made of silicone with a radiopaque strip to permit visualization on x-ray. These catheters have three sections: an intraperitoneal section, with numerous openings and an open tip to allow dialysate to flow freely; a subcutaneous section that passes from the peritoneal membrane and tunnels through muscle and subcutaneous fat to the skin; and an external section for connection to the manufacturer specific transfer set which then connects to the dialysate tubing with attached dialysate. Most adult catheters have 2 cuffs made of Dacron polyester. The cuffs stabilize the catheter, limit movement, prevent leaks, and provide a barrier against microorganisms. One cuff is placed just distal to the peritoneum, and the other cuff is placed subcutaneously. The subcutaneous tunnel (5 to 10 cm long) further protects against bacterial infection (see <a href="#ff48-7">Fig.&#x00A0;48-7</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff48-7">

After a prescribed period of time, the fluid is drained by gravity and discarded. New solution is then infused into the peritoneal cavity until the next drainage period. Dialysis thus continues on a 24-hour-a-day basis, during which the patient is free to move around and engage in their usual activities.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Performing the Exchange</h6>
<p class="nonindent">All types of PD involve a series of exchanges or cycles. An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;exchange:&lt;/b&gt; denotes a complete cycle including fill, dwell, and drain phases of peritoneal dialysis">exchange</button></strong> is the entire cycle including drainage of the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;effluent:&lt;/b&gt; term used to describe the drained fluid from a peritoneal dialysis exchange">effluent</button></strong> (fluid), instillation of the dialysate, and dwell. This cycle is repeated throughout the course of the dialysis.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the dwell time, the drainage portion of the exchange begins. The dialysate is infused by gravity into the peritoneal cavity. A period of about 10 minutes is usually required to infuse 2 to 3 L of fluid. A sterile cap is applied to the transfer set and the patient can perform ADLs. The prescribed dwell, or equilibration time, allows diffusion and osmosis to occur. At the end of the prescribed dwell, the patient performs hand hygiene, dons a mask, removes the sterile cap, unclamps the transfer set, and the solution drains from the peritoneal cavity by gravity through a closed system. Drainage is usually completed in 20 to 30 minutes. The drainage fluid is normally colorless or straw-colored and should not be cloudy. Bloody or pink-colored drainage may be seen in the first few exchanges after insertion of a new catheter, but should not occur after that time (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The number of cycles or exchanges and their frequency are prescribed based on monthly laboratory values and the presence of uremic symptoms. The exchanges can be performed manually during the waking hours by the patient (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD]) or via the use of a PD machine (cycler) that automatically performs exchanges, usually while the patient is sleeping at night (continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis [CCPD]).</p>
<p class="indent">The removal of excess water during PD occurs because dialysate has a high dextrose concentration, making it hypertonic. An osmotic gradient is created between the blood and the dialysate solution. Dextrose solutions of 1.5%, 2.5%, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1587" title="1587"></span>4.25% are available in several volumes, from 1000 to 3000 mL. The higher the dextrose concentration, the greater the osmotic gradient and the more water will be removed. Selection of the appropriate solution is based on the patient&#x2019;s fluid status (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2177">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most complications of PD are often minor; however, several, if unattended, can have serious consequences.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acute Complications</h6>
<p class="h7">Peritonitis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Peritonitis is the most common and serious complication of PD. The first sign of peritonitis is cloudy dialysate effluent (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>). Diffuse abdominal pain and rebound tenderness often occur later. Hypotension and other signs of shock may also occur with advancing infection. The patient with peritonitis may be treated as an inpatient or outpatient (most common), depending on the severity of the infection and the patient&#x2019;s clinical status. Effluent is examined for WBC count. Gram stain and culture are used to identify the organism and guide treatment. If the effluent WBC count is greater than 100 &#x00B5;L (after a dwell time of at least 2&#x00A0;hours) with over 50% polymorphonuclear cells, then broad-spectrum antibiotic agents (aminoglycosides or cephalosporins) are usually added to subsequent exchanges until Gram stain or culture results are available for specific antibiotic sensitivity. Intraperitoneal administration of antibiotic agents is as effective as IV administration and, therefore, most often used. Antibiotic therapy continues for 14 to 21 days (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>). Careful selection and calculation of the antibiotic dosages are needed to prevent nephrotoxicity and further compromise of residual renal function.</p>
<p class="indent">During an episode of peritonitis, the patient loses large amounts of protein through the peritoneal membrane due to inflammation and increased permeability. Acute malnutrition and delayed healing and recovery from the peritonitis may result. Therefore, attention must be given to educating the patient to detect and promptly seek treatment for peritonitis.</p>
<p class="h7">Leakage</p>
<p class="nonindent">In general, use of the PD catheter is delayed for at least 2 weeks post insertion to allow healing to occur and to prevent leakage through the tunnel and exit site. It also allows the exit site time to heal. However, leakage of dialysate through the catheter site may occur even after a healing period. Usually, the leak stops spontaneously when dialysis is withheld for several days, giving the tissue the opportunity to heal around the catheter cuffs and to seal the insertion tunnel. During this time, it is important to reduce factors that might delay healing, such as undue abdominal muscle activity (bending, lifting over 5 lb) and straining during bowel movements. In many cases, leakage can be avoided by using small volumes (500 mL) of dialysate, gradually increasing the volume up to 2000 to 3000 mL (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Payton &#x0026; Kennedy, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Bleeding</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bloody effluent may be observed occasionally, especially in young, menstruating women. (The hypertonic fluid pulls blood from the uterus, through the opening in the fallopian tubes, and into the peritoneal cavity.) Bleeding is also common during the first few exchanges after a new catheter insertion because some blood enters the abdominal cavity following insertion. The bleeding most often clears up after several exchanges. In many cases, no cause can be found for the bleeding, although catheter displacement from the pelvis has occasionally been associated with bleeding. Some patients have had bloody effluent after an enema or from minor trauma. Most often, bleeding stops in 1 to 2 days and requires no specific intervention. More frequent exchanges and the addition of heparin to the dialysate during this time may be necessary to prevent blood clots from obstructing the catheter (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Long-Term Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertriglyceridemia, likely due to the use of glucose containing dialysate, is common in patients on long-term PD, suggesting that the therapy may contribute to atherogenesis. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with both CKD and ESKD, and many patients have suboptimal blood pressure control which contributes to cardiovascular disease. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are often used to control hypertension, decrease proteinuria, and protect the heart, and the use of aspirin and statins should be considered (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other complications that may occur with long-term PD include abdominal hernias (incisional, inguinal, diaphragmatic, and umbilical), likely resulting from continuously increased intra-abdominal pressure. The persistently elevated intra-abdominal pressure also aggravates symptoms of hiatal hernia and hemorrhoids. Low back pain and anorexia from fluid in the abdomen and a constant sweet taste related to glucose absorption may also be experienced by the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Mechanical problems occasionally occur and may interfere with instillation or drainage of the dialysate. Formation of clots and fibrin in the peritoneal catheter and constipation are factors that may contribute to these problems.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2178">Approaches</h5>
<p class="nonindent">PD can be performed using several different approaches: acute intermittent peritoneal dialysis, CAPD, and CCPD.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acute Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Indications for acute intermittent PD, a variation of PD, include uremic signs and symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, altered mental status), fluid overload, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Although PD is not as efficient as HD in removing solute and fluid, it permits a more gradual change in the patient&#x2019;s fluid volume status and in waste product removal. Therefore, it may be the treatment of choice for the patient who is hemodynamically unstable. It can be carried out manually (the nurse warms and hangs each container of dialysate) or by a cycler machine. Exchange times range from 30 minutes to 2 hours. One example of a routine is hourly exchanges consisting of a 10-minute infusion, a 30-minute dwell time, and a 20-minute drain time. Acute intermittent PD is not indicated for long-term patient management, but for specific situations such as patients who are referred late in the course of CKD (CKD stage 5) and require immediate dialysis (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1587</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1588" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1588">p. 1588</span></div>
<p class="indent">Maintaining the PD cycle is a nursing responsibility. Aseptic technique is maintained when changing solution bags and emptying effluent bags. Vital signs, weight, I&#x0026;O, laboratory values, and patient status are frequently monitored. The nurse uses a flow sheet on paper or within the electronic health record to document each exchange and records vital signs, dialysate concentration, medications added, exchange volume, dwell time, dialysate fluid balance for each exchange (fluid lost or gained), and cumulative fluid balance. The nurse also carefully assesses skin turgor and mucous membranes to evaluate fluid status and monitor the patient for edema. Daily weight is the most accurate indicator of fluid volume status. Patients receiving CAPD are generally weighed with a dwell, while those on CCPD may not carry a daytime dwell and may be weighed without a dwell. The presence of absence of a dwell during the daily weight should be documented.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>If the peritoneal fluid does not drain properly, the nurse can facilitate drainage by turning the patient from side to side, having the patient sit or stand, or raising the head of the bed. The peritoneal catheter should never be manipulated.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Other measures to promote drainage include checking the patency of the catheter by inspecting for kinks, closed clamps, or an air lock. The nurse monitors for complications, including peritonitis, bleeding, respiratory difficulty, and leakage of peritoneal fluid around the catheter. In addition, the nurse must ensure that the PD catheter remains secure and that the dressing remains dry and is changed on a routine basis. The patient and family are educated about the procedure and are kept informed about progress (fluid loss, weight loss, laboratory values). Emotional support and encouragement are given to the patient and family during this stressful and uncertain time.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)</strong> works on the same principles as other forms of PD: diffusion and osmosis. Less extreme fluctuations in the patient&#x2019;s laboratory values occur with CAPD than with intermittent PD or HD because the dialysis is constantly in progress. The serum electrolyte levels often remain in the normal range.</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient performs exchanges four or five times a day, 24&#x00A0;hours a day, 7 days a week, at intervals scheduled throughout the day. Different manufacturers supply slightly different equipment. A closed Y-shaped system is most commonly used, in which a bag containing dialysate solution comes connected to one branch of the &#x201C;Y&#x201D; and a sterile empty bag is connected to the second branch. This leaves the third part of the &#x201C;Y&#x201D; open and available for connection to the transfer set on the PD catheter. To perform an exchange, the patient (or person doing the exchange) washes their hands, dons a mask, and then removes the cap from the transfer set while maintaining sterility. The open end of the &#x201C;Y&#x201D; set is connected to the end of the transfer set and the dialysate is drained into the attached empty sterile bag (effluent) (over about 20 to 30&#x00A0;minutes). Then the attached dialysate is infused, the patient clamps off the transfer set and the tubing set, disconnects the tubing set, and applies a new sterile cap to the transfer set, making it a closed system.</p>
<p class="indent">For some patients, depending on the characteristic of the peritoneal membrane, the longer the dwell time, the better the clearance of uremic toxins. If dwell time is excessive (e.g., overnight dwells), the patient will absorb some of the effluent back into the body simply because the osmotic gradient is lost. Once equilibrium is reached, the movement of fluid and toxins stops (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">To reduce the risk of peritonitis, the patient (and all caregivers) must use meticulous aseptic care to avoid contaminating the catheter, fluid, or tubing and to avoid accidentally disconnecting the catheter from the tubing. Whenever a connection or disconnection is made, hand hygiene must be performed and a mask worn by anyone within 6 ft of the area to avoid contamination with airborne bacteria. Excess manipulation should be avoided, and meticulous care of the catheter exit site is provided using a standardized protocol. At home, a patient is taught to use clean technique for exit site care (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Payton &#x0026; Kennedy, 2017</a>). In the hospital, due to the increased risk of infection, sterile technique is employed by the nurse and patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)</strong> uses a machine called a cycler to provide the fluid exchanges. It is programmed to deliver an established amount of PD solution that will dwell in the peritoneal cavity for a programmed period of time before it drains from the peritoneal cavity via gravity. The cycler is also set to deliver a specific number of fluid changes in a designated period of time. Because it is programmed, it also keeps track of the total amounts removed and will sound an alarm if limits are not met. It requires that a person set up and break down the system for use, which typically takes about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">CCPD may combine overnight intermittent PD with a prolonged dwell time during the day. However, some patients are drained completely after completing the nighttime exchanges and do not carry a dwell during the day. This avoids reabsorption of fluid during the long daytime dwell. Every evening, the patient connects the peritoneal catheter to tubing on the cycler machine, usually just before the patient goes to sleep for the night. Because the machine is very quiet, the patient can sleep, and the extra-long tubing allows the patient to move and turn normally. In the morning, the patient disconnects from the cycler. This process is done every day to achieve the effects of dialysis required.</p>
<p class="indent">CCPD has a lower infection rate than other forms of PD because there are fewer opportunities for contamination with bag changes and tubing disconnections. It also allows the patient to be free from exchanges throughout the day, making it possible to engage in work and activities of daily living more freely (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2179">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Meeting Psychosocial Needs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the complications of PD described previously, patients who elect to do PD may experience altered body image <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1589" title="1589"></span>because of the presence of the abdominal catheter, bag, tubing, and cycler. Waist size increases from 1 to 2 inches (or more) with fluid in the abdomen. This affects clothing selection and may make the patient feel distended or fat. The nurse may arrange for the patient to talk with other patients who have adapted well to PD. Although some patients have no psychological problems with the catheter&#x2014;they think of it as their lifeline and as a life-sustaining device&#x2014;other patients feel they are doing exchanges all day long and have no free time, particularly in the beginning. They may experience depression because they feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of self-care.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients undergoing PD may also experience altered sexuality patterns and sexual dysfunction. The patient and partner may be reluctant to engage in sexual activities, partly because of the catheter being psychologically &#x201C;in the way&#x201D; of sexual performance. In patients on CCPD, the presence of the dialysis cycler in the bedroom and the continual connection during the sleeping hours can also cause interference with intimacy. Although these problems may resolve with time, some problems may warrant special counseling. Questions by the nurse about concerns related to sexuality and sexual function often provide the patient with a welcome opportunity to discuss these issues and a first step toward assisting in their resolution.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are educated as inpatients or outpatients to perform PD once their condition is medically stable. Education generally takes 5 days to 2 weeks. Patients are taught according to their own learning ability and knowledge level and only as much at one time as they can handle without feeling uncomfortable or becoming saturated. Education topics for the patient and family who will be performing PD at home are described in <a href="#ct48-12">Chart&#x00A0;48-12</a>. The use of an adult learning theory&#x2013;based curriculum may decrease peritonitis and exit site infection rates (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelman &#x0026; Watson, 2017</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Because of protein loss with PD, the patient is instructed to eat a high-protein (1.2 to 1.3g/kg/day), low phosphorus, nutritious diet (NKF KDOQI, 2000). The patient is also encouraged to increase their daily fiber intake to help prevent constipation, which can impede the flow of dialysate into or out of the peritoneal cavity. Patients may gain 3 to 5 lb within a month of initiating PD, so they may be asked to limit their carbohydrate intake to avoid weight gain. Potassium and fluid restrictions are not usually necessary. Patients commonly lose at least 1 to 2 L of fluid over and above the volume of dialysate infused into the abdomen during a 24-hour period, permitting a moderate fluid intake.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Follow-up care through phone calls, visits to the dialysis clinic, outpatient department, and continuing home care assists patients in the transition to home and promotes their active participation in their own health care. Patients often check with the nurse to see if they are making the correct choices about dialysate or control of blood pressure, or simply to discuss a problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may be seen by the PD team as outpatients once a month or more often if needed. The exchange procedure is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1590" title="1590"></span>evaluated at that time to reassess that strict aseptic technique is followed. Blood chemistry and effluent values are followed closely to make certain the therapy is adequate for the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">If a referral is made for home care, the home health nurse assesses the home environment and suggests modifications to accommodate the equipment and facilities needed to carry out PD. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s understanding of PD and evaluates their technique in performing PD. Assessments include checking for changes related to kidney disease; any complications such as peritonitis; medication management; and treatment-related problems such as heart failure, inadequate drainage, and weight gain or loss. The nurse continues to reinforce and clarify education about PD and ESKD and assesses the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s progress in coping with the procedure. This is also an opportunity to remind patients about the need to participate in appropriate health promotion activities and health screening (e.g., gynecologic examinations, colonoscopy).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2180">Special Considerations: Nursing Management of the Patient on Dialysis Who Is Hospitalized</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Whether undergoing HD or PD, the patient may be hospitalized for treatment of complications related to the dialysis treatment, the underlying kidney disorder, or health problems not related to renal dysfunction or its treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Protecting Vascular Access</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient undergoing HD is hospitalized for any reason, care must be taken to protect the vascular access. The nurse assesses the vascular access for patency and takes precautions to ensure that the extremity with the vascular access is not used for measuring blood pressure or for obtaining blood specimens. Constricting dressings, restraints, or jewelry over the vascular access must be avoided as well (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Inglese, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The bruit, or &#x201C;thrill,&#x201D; over the venous access site must be evaluated at least every 8 to 12 hours. Absence of a palpable thrill or audible bruit may indicate blockage or clotting in the vascular access. Clotting can occur if the patient has an infection anywhere in the body (serum viscosity increases) or if the blood pressure has dropped. When blood flow is reduced through the access for any reason (hypotension, application of blood pressure cuff or tourniquet), the access can clot. When a patient has an HD catheter, the nurse must observe for signs and symptoms of infection such as redness, swelling, drainage from the exit site, fever, and chills. The nurse must assess the integrity of the dressing and change it as needed. Patients with kidney disease are more prone to infection; therefore, appropriate infection control measures must be used for all procedures. The patient&#x2019;s vascular access should not be used for any purpose other than dialysis, unless it is an emergency situation and no other access is available. In this situation, a dialysis nurse or physician should cannulate the vascular access. If accessing an HD catheter in an emergency, the catheter dwell volume should be withdrawn prior to medication or fluid administration.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Taking Precautions during Intravenous Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient needs IV therapy, the rate of administration must be as slow as possible to avoid volume overload in the patient with renal disease or ESKD. Accurate I&#x0026;O records are essential.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Because patients on dialysis cannot excrete water, rapid administration of IV fluid can result in pulmonary edema.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Symptoms of Uremia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As metabolic end products accumulate, symptoms of uremia worsen. Patients whose metabolic rate accelerates (those receiving corticosteroid medications or parenteral nutrition, those with infections or bleeding disorders, those undergoing surgery) accumulate waste products more quickly and may require daily dialysis. These same patients are more likely than other patients receiving dialysis to experience complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Detecting Cardiac and Respiratory Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac and respiratory assessment must be conducted frequently. As fluid builds up, fluid overload, heart failure, and pulmonary edema develop. Crackles in the bases of the lungs, moist cough and frothy, blood-tinged sputum may indicate pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="indent">Pericarditis may result from the accumulation of uremic toxins. If not detected and treated promptly, this serious complication may progress to pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Pericarditis is detected by the patient&#x2019;s report of substernal chest pain, low-grade fever, and pericardial friction rub. A pulsus paradoxus (a decrease in blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration) is often present. When pericarditis progresses to effusion, the friction rub disappears, heart sounds become distant and muffled, ECG waves show very low voltage, and the pulsus paradoxus worsens (see <a href="c24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a> for further discussion of pericarditis).</p>
<p class="indent">The effusion may progress to life-threatening cardiac tamponade, noted by narrowing of the pulse pressure in addition to muffled or inaudible heart sounds, crushing chest pain, dyspnea, and hypotension. An emergent pericardial window procedure is performed and a chest tube is inserted to drain the pericardial effusion. The effusion fluid is sent for laboratory and cytology analysis.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Although pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade can be detected by chest x-ray, they should also be detected through astute nursing assessment. Because of their clinical significance, assessment of the patient for these complications is a priority.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Controlling Electrolyte Levels and Diet</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Electrolyte alterations are common, and potassium changes can be life-threatening. All IV solutions and medications to be given are evaluated for their electrolyte content. Serum laboratory values are assessed daily. If blood transfusions are required, they may be given during HD, if possible, so that excess potassium and fluid can be removed and hypervolemia is avoided. Dietary intake must also be monitored. The patient&#x2019;s frustrations related to dietary restrictions typically increase if the food is unappetizing. The nurse needs to recognize that this may lead to dietary indiscretion with resultant hyperkalemia.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1590</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1591" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1591">p. 1591</span></div>
<p class="indent">Hypoalbuminemia is an indicator of malnutrition in patients undergoing long-term or maintenance dialysis. Although some patients can be treated with adequate nutrition alone, some patients remain hypoalbuminemic for reasons that are poorly understood.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Discomfort and Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Complications such as pruritus and pain secondary to neuropathy must be managed. Antihistamine agents, such as diphenhydramine, are commonly used, and analgesic medications may be prescribed. However, because elimination of the metabolites of medications occurs through dialysis rather than through renal excretion, medication dosages often need to be adjusted. Keeping the skin clean and well moisturized using bath oils, superfatted soap, and creams or lotions helps promote comfort and reduce itching. Instructing the patient to keep the nails trimmed to avoid scratching and excoriation also promotes comfort.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Blood Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension in kidney disease is common. It is usually the result of fluid overload and, in part, oversecretion of renin. Many patients undergoing dialysis receive some form of antihypertensive therapy. Patients require detailed education and reinforcement of information regarding their antihypertensive regimen, because it is not uncommon for patients to need more than one antihypertensive agent. Rapid fluid fluctuations in patients receiving dialysis also create challenges to maintaining blood pressure control. Antihypertensive agents are often withheld before dialysis and administered after dialysis to avoid hypotension due to the combined effect of fluid removal with the dialysis treatment and the medication (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Campoy, 2017</a>). Typically, these patients require multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve normal blood pressure, thus adding to the total number of medications needed on an ongoing basis (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Campoy, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with ESKD commonly have decreased phagocytic ability with low WBC counts, low RBC counts (anemia), impaired platelet function, and are often prescribed anticoagulants to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Together, these pose a high risk of infection and potential for bleeding after even minor trauma. Preventing and controlling infection are essential because the incidence of infection is high. Infection of the vascular access site and pneumonia are common (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Inglese, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Caring for the Catheter Site</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients receiving CAPD usually know how to care for the catheter exit site. However, the hospital stay is an opportunity to assess catheter care technique and correct misperceptions or deviations from recommended technique. Recommended daily or 3 or 4 times weekly routine catheter site care is typically performed during showering or bathing (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Payton &#x0026; Kennedy, 2017</a>). The exit site should not be submerged in bathwater. The most common cleaning method is soap and water; liquid soap is recommended. During care, the nurse and patient need to make sure that the catheter remains secure to avoid tension and trauma. The patient may wear a gauze dressing over the exit site.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Administering Medications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">All medications and the dosage prescribed for any patient on dialysis must be closely monitored to avoid those that are toxic to the kidneys and may threaten residual renal function. Medications are also scrutinized for potassium and magnesium content; those medications that contain them are avoided. Care must be taken to evaluate all problems and symptoms that the patient reports without automatically attributing them to kidney disease or to dialysis therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Psychological Support</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Over time, patients undergoing chronic dialysis may begin to reevaluate their status, the treatment modality, their satisfaction with life, and the impact of these factors on their families and support systems. Nurses must provide opportunities for these patients to express their feelings and reactions and to explore options. The decision to begin dialysis does not require that dialysis be continued indefinitely, and it is not uncommon for patients to consider discontinuing treatment. These feelings and reactions must be taken seriously, and the patient should have the opportunity to discuss them with the dialysis team as well as with a psychologist, psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, trusted friend, or spiritual advisor. After a psychiatric evaluation has ruled out depression, the patient&#x2019;s informed decision about discontinuing treatment should be respected. If the patient is thought to be depressed, treatment for depression should be initiated and the patient stabilized prior to participating in decisions on advanced directives (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Molzahn &#x0026; Schick-Makaroff, 2017</a>).</p>
