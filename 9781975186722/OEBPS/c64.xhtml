<p class="nonindent">The diverse group of neurologic disorders that make up infectious and autoimmune disorders and cranial and peripheral neuropathies presents unique challenges for nursing care. The nurse who cares for patients with these disorders must have a clear understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnostic testing, medical and nursing care, and rehabilitation processes. Some of the issues nurses must help patients and families confront include adaptation to the effects of the disease, potential changes in family dynamics, and end-of-life issues.</p>
