<p class="nonindent">Each time a tumor is exposed to chemotherapy, a percentage of the tumor cells (20% to 99%, depending on dosage and agent) are destroyed. Repeated doses of chemotherapy are necessary over a prolonged period to achieve regression of the tumor. Eradication of 100% of the tumor is almost impossible; the goal of treatment is eradication of enough of the tumor so that the remaining malignant cells can be destroyed by the body&#x2019;s immune system (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Actively proliferating cells within a tumor are the most sensitive to chemotherapy (the ratio of dividing cells to resting cells is referred to as the growth fraction). Nondividing cells capable of future proliferation are the least sensitive to antineoplastic medications and consequently are potentially dangerous. However, the nondividing cells must be destroyed to eradicate the disease. Repeated cycles of chemotherapy or sequencing of multiple chemotherapeutic agents is used to achieve more tumor cell destruction by destroying the nondividing tumor cells as they begin active cell division.</p>
<p class="indent">Reproduction of both healthy and malignant cells follows the cell cycle pattern (see <a href="c12-sec05.xhtml#ff12-2">Fig.&#x00A0;12-2</a>). All cells in the body (healthy and malignant) are affected by chemotherapy. The effect of chemotherapy on the body&#x2019;s cells is best described in relation to the cell cycle. The cell cycle time is the time required for one cell to divide and reproduce two identical daughter cells. The cell cycle of any cell has four distinct phases, each with a vital underlying function (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>G<sub>1</sub> phase&#x2014;RNA and protein synthesis occurs</span></li>
<li><span>S phase&#x2014;DNA synthesis occurs</span></li>
<li><span>G<sub>2</sub> phase&#x2014;premitotic phase; DNA synthesis is complete, mitotic spindle forms</span></li>
<li><span>Mitosis&#x2014;duplicated chromosomes separate, and cell division occurs</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s398">Classification of Chemotherapeutic Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chemotherapeutic agents may be classified by their mechanism of action in relation to the cell cycle. Agents that exert their maximal effect during specific phases of the cell cycle are termed <em>cell cycle&#x2013;specific agents</em> (e.g., docetaxal, vinblastine, etoposide). These agents destroy cells that are actively reproducing by means of the cell cycle; most affect cells in the S phase by interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis. Other agents, such as plant alkaloids, are specific to the M phase, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page320" title="320"></span>where they halt mitotic spindle formation. Chemotherapeutic agents that act independently of the cell cycle phases are termed <em>cell cycle&#x2013;nonspecific agents</em> (e.g., busulfan, cisplatin, bleomycin). These agents usually have a prolonged effect on cells, leading to cellular damage or death. Many treatment plans combine agents that target different phases of the cell cycle to increase the number of vulnerable tumor cells killed during a treatment period (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Dickens &#x0026; Ahmed, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapeutic agents are also classified by chemical group, each with a different mechanism of action. These include the alkylating agents, nitrosoureas, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics, topoisomerase inhibitors, plant alkaloids (also referred to as mitotic inhibitors), hormonal agents, and miscellaneous agents. The classification, mechanism of action, cell cycle specificity, and common side effects of select antineoplastic agents are listed in <a href="#tt12-7">Table&#x00A0;12-7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapeutic agents from multiple categories may be used together to maximize cell destruction. Combination chemotherapy relies on agents with varying mechanisms, potential synergistic actions, and differing toxicities. The use of combination therapy also helps prevent the development of drug-resistant cells (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Dickens &#x0026; Ahmed, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s399">Adjunct Chemotherapeutic Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In certain regimens, additional medications are given with chemotherapy agents to enhance activity or protect normal cells from injury. For example, leucovorin is often given with fluorouracil to treat colorectal cancer. Leucovorin, a compound similar to folic acid, helps fluorouracil bind with an enzyme inside of cancer cells and enhances the ability of fluorouracil to remain in the intracellular environment. Leucovorin also rescues normal cells from the toxic effects of high doses of methotrexate. When given at certain doses for the treatment of some forms of leukemia or lymphoma, methotrexate causes a folic acid deficiency in cells, resulting in cell death. Significant toxicity, including severe bone marrow suppression, mucositis, diarrhea and liver, and lung and kidney damage, can occur. Leucovorin helps to prevent or lessen these toxicities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s400">Administration of Chemotherapeutic Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chemotherapy may be given in the hospital, outpatient center, or home setting by multiple routes. The route of administration depends on the type of agent; the required dose; and the type, location, and extent of malignant disease being treated. Standards for the safe administration of chemotherapy have been developed by the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1028">Neuss, Gilmore, Belderson, et al., 2017</a>). Patient education is essential to maximize safety when chemotherapy is given in the home.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dosage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The dosage of chemotherapeutic agents is based primarily on the patient&#x2019;s total body surface area, weight, previous exposure and response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and function of major organ systems. Dosages are determined to maximize cell kill while minimizing impact on healthy tissues and subsequent toxicities. The therapeutic effect may be compromised if modified and inadequate dosing is required due to toxicities. Modification of dosage is often required if critical laboratory values or the patient&#x2019;s symptoms indicate unacceptable or dangerous toxicities. Chemotherapy treatment regimens include standard-dose therapy, dose-dense regimens (giving chemotherapy more frequently than standard treatment regimens), and myeloablative therapy for HSCT. For certain chemotherapeutic agents, there is a maximum lifetime dose limit that must be adhered to because of the danger of long-term irreversible organ complications (e.g., because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, doxorubicin has a cumulative lifetime dose limit of 550 mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Extravasation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intravenously administered chemotherapy agents are additionally classified by their potential to damage tissue if they inadvertently leak from a vein into surrounding tissue; this leakage is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;extravasation:&lt;/b&gt; leakage of intravenous medication from the veins into the subcutaneous tissues">extravasation</button></strong>. The consequences of extravasation range from mild discomfort to severe tissue destruction, depending on whether the agent is classified as an irritant or vesicant. Irritant agents induce a localized inflammatory reaction at the infusion or injection site, but usually do not cause permanent tissue damage (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen, LeFebvre, &#x0026; Brassil, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike irritants, <strong>vesicants</strong> are agents that cause inflammation, tissue damage, and possibly necrosis of tendons, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels if extravasation occurs (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Although the mechanism of vesicant actions varies with each drug, some agents bind to cell DNA and cause cell death that progresses to involve neighboring cells, whereas other agents are metabolized into cells and cause a localized, painful reaction that usually improves over time. Sloughing and ulceration of the tissue may progress to tissue necrosis that is so severe that skin grafting becomes necessary. The full extent of tissue damage may take several weeks to become apparent. Examples of commonly used agents classified as vesicants include dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, nitrogen mustard, mitomycin, vinblastine, and vincristine. Chemotherapy administration safety standards require the availability of defined extravasation management procedures, including antidote order sets and accessibility of antidotes in all settings where vesicant chemotherapy is given (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapy is given only by those who have the knowledge and established competencies for vesicant and extravasation management (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Prevention and management of extravasation are essential. Vesicant chemotherapy should never be given in peripheral veins involving the hand or wrist. Peripheral administration is permitted for short-duration infusions only, and placement of the venipuncture site should be on the forearm area using a soft, plastic catheter. For any frequent or prolonged administration of antineoplastic vesicants, right atrial silastic catheters, implanted venous access devices, or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) should be inserted to promote safety during medication administration and reduce problems with access to the circulatory system (<a href="#ff12-3">Figs. 12-3</a> and <a href="#ff12-4">12-4</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hypersensitivity Reactions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) can occur with any medication, many chemotherapy agents pose a high risk and have been associated with life-threatening outcomes (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). HSRs are a subgroup of adverse drug reactions that are unexpected and associated with mild or progressively worsening signs and symptoms, such as rash, urticaria, fever, hypotension, cardiac instability, dyspnea, wheezing, throat tightness, and syncope. Immediate HSRs may appear within 5 minutes and up to 6 hours of an infusion. Delayed HSRs may occur after the completion of the infusion. Although patients may or may not react to the first infusion of a chemotherapy agent, repeated exposure increases the likelihood of a reaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Most immediate HSRs are immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions&#x2014;an allergic reaction (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Examples of agents that may cause an allergic, IgE-mediated response include carboplatin, oxaliplatin, and L-asparaginase. However, some HSRs, such as anaphylactoid reactions, are non&#x2013;IgE-mediated (nonallergic) and a result of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Rituximab and cetuximab are examples of agents associated with non&#x2013;IgE-mediated (nonallergic) HSRs. When signs and symptoms of HSR occur, the medication should be discontinued immediately, and emergency procedures initiated. Many institutions have developed specific protocols for responding to HSRs, including standing orders for administration of emergency medications (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1035">Rosell&#x00F3;, Blasco, Garc&#x00ED;a Fabregat, et al., 2017</a>). (See <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> for further discussion of allergic reactions.)</p>
<p class="indent">For some chemotherapeutic agents, especially if they are essential in the treatment plan, desensitization procedures may be possible, and the patient is retreated with the agent at reduced dosages or slower infusion rates. Premedication regimens are used for certain chemotherapy agents to prevent or minimize reactions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Toxicity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Toxicity associated with chemotherapy can be acute or chronic. Cells with rapid growth rates (e.g., epithelium, bone marrow, hair follicles, sperm) are very susceptible to damage, and the effects may manifest in virtually any body system.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff12-4">

<p class="h7">Gastrointestinal System</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea and vomiting, which may persist for 24 to 48 hours; delayed nausea and vomiting may occur up to 1 week after administration. The experience of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) may affect quality of life, psychological status, nutrition, fluid and electrolyte status, functional ability, compliance with treatment, and utilization of health care resources (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Natale, 2018</a>). Comorbidities, the underlying malignancy, other treatment modalities, and medications, as well as symptoms (e.g., pain), may contribute to CINV. Acute CINV is experienced in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page323" title="323"></span>with a maximal intensity after 5 to 6 hours; delayed CINV occurs 24 hours posttreatment and may last as many as 7 days with a maximal intensity 48 to 72 hours after drug administration (anticipatory nausea and vomiting, occurring prior to administration of chemotherapy, may be a conditioned response triggered by a stimulus such as the smell of the infusion setting, the sight of the nurse, or the outpatient center waiting room) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Several mechanisms are responsible for the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, including activation of multiple receptors found in the vomiting center of the medulla, the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the gastrointestinal tract, the pharynx, and the cerebral cortex. Activation of neurotransmitter receptors in these areas is thought to induce CINV. Stimulation may originate through peripheral, autonomic, vestibular, or cognitive pathways. The primary neuroreceptors known to be implicated in CINV are 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) and dopamine receptors (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The approach for managing CINV is based on the knowledge of the probability of emesis of the chemotherapy agents used. Algorithms are used to prevent and treat CINV based on national guidelines that consider this classification of chemotherapy agents (NCCN, 2019g).</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroids, phenothiazines, sedatives, and histamines are helpful, especially when used in combination with serotonin blockers to provide antiemetic protection (NCCN, 2019g). In order to manage delayed nausea and vomiting, antiemetic medications may be combined and are given for the first week at home after chemotherapy. Nonpharmacologic approaches such as relaxation techniques, imagery, acupressure, or acupuncture can help decrease stimuli contributing to symptoms and may be most helpful for patients with anticipatory nausea and vomiting. Small, frequent meals, bland foods, and comfort foods may reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Stomatitis is commonly associated with some chemotherapy agents because of the rapid turnover of epithelium that lines the oral cavity. The entire gastrointestinal tract is susceptible to mucositis. Antimetabolites and antitumor antibiotics are the major culprits in mucositis and other gastrointestinal symptoms, which can be severe in some patients.</p>
<p class="h7">Hematopoietic System</p>
<p class="nonindent">Many chemotherapy agents cause some degree of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myelosuppression:&lt;/b&gt; suppression of the blood cell&#x2013;producing function of the bone marrow">myelosuppression</button></strong> (depression of bone marrow function), resulting in leukopenia (decreased WBCs), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neutropenia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormally low absolute neutrophil count">neutropenia</button></strong> (decreased granulocytes), anemia (decreased red blood cells [RBCs]), thrombocytopenia (decreased platelets), and increased risk of infection and bleeding (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Depression of these cells is the usual reason for limiting the dose of the chemotherapy. Myelosuppression is predictable; for most agents, patients usually reach the point at which blood counts are lowest 7 to 14 days after chemotherapy has been given. During these 2 weeks, nurses anticipate associated toxicities, especially a fever associated with neutrophil count less than 1,500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts is essential, and patients are educated about strategies to protect against infection, injury, and blood loss, particularly while counts are low.</p>
<p class="indent">Other agents&#x2014;colony-stimulating factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF])&#x2014;can be given after chemotherapy to stimulate the bone marrow to produce WBCs, especially neutrophils, at an accelerated rate, thus decreasing the duration of neutropenia. G-CSF and GM-CSF decrease the episodes of infection and the need for antibiotics and allow for more timely treatment cycles of chemotherapy with less need to reduce the dosage. Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates RBC production, thus decreasing the symptoms of treatment-induced chronic anemia and reducing the need for blood transfusions. Interleukin 11 (IL-11) (oprelvekin) stimulates the production of megakaryocytes (precursors to platelets) and can be used to prevent and treat severe thrombocytopenia but has had limited use because of toxicities, such as HSR; capillary leak syndrome; pulmonary edema; atrial arrhythmias; and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Renal System</p>
<p class="nonindent">Some chemotherapy agents can cause renal dysfunction by damaging the blood vessels or filtering structures of the kidneys (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Clinical manifestations of renal dysfunction from conventional chemotherapy can range from the asymptomatic elevation of serum electrolytes and creatinine levels to acute kidney injury (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1002">Merchan, Jhaveri, Berns, et al., 2017</a>). Cisplatin, methotrexate, and mitomycin are particularly toxic to the kidneys (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Damage to the kidneys may also result in impaired water secretion, leading to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Rapid tumor cell lysis after chemotherapy results in increased urinary excretion of uric acid, which can cause renal damage. In addition, intracellular contents are released into circulation, resulting in hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia and obstructive nephropathy. (See later discussion of tumor lysis syndrome.)</p>
<p class="indent">The monitoring of laboratory values, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum electrolytes is essential (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Adequate hydration and diuresis to prevent formation of uric acid crystals and administration of allopurinol may be used to prevent renal toxicity. Amifostine has demonstrated an ability to minimize renal toxicities associated with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemorrhagic cystitis is a bladder toxicity that can result from cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, and alkylating agent (e.g., busulfan and thiotepa) therapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Hematuria can range from microscopic to frank bleeding with symptoms ranging from transient irritation during urination, dysuria, and suprapubic pain to life-threatening hemorrhage. Protection of the bladder focuses on aggressive IV hydration, frequent voiding, and diuresis.</p>
<p class="h7">Cardiopulmonary System</p>
<p class="nonindent">Several chemotherapy agents are associated with cardiac toxicity. Anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin, doxorubicin) are known to cause irreversible cumulative cardiac toxicities when total dosage reaches 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Henriksen, 2018</a>). If these agents are given in the presence of thoracic radiation therapy or other agents with cardiotoxicity potential, the cumulative dose limit is lower. Patients at increased risk for the development of cardiac toxicities include: extreme ages &#x003E;65 years or &#x003C;18 years, female gender, African American race, chest radiation, kidney failure, and preexisting cardiac disease (including hypertension) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Henriksen, 2018</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page324" title="324"></span>Dexrazoxane has been used on a limited basis as a cardio-protectant when doxorubicin is needed in individuals who have already received a cumulative dose limit and continuation of therapy is deemed beneficial. Patients with known cardiac disease (e.g., heart failure) are treated with lower doses or agents not known to be associated with cardiac toxicity. Cardiac ejection fraction (volume of blood ejected from the heart with each beat) and other signs of heart failure must be monitored closely.</p>
<p class="indent">Bleomycin, carmustine, busulfan, mitomycin C, and paclitaxel/docetaxel, among other agents, have toxic effects on lung function, such as alveolar damage, bronchospasm, pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Therefore, patients are monitored closely for changes in pulmonary function, including pulmonary function test results. Patients with known lung disease are treated with alternative agents not known to cause pulmonary toxicity. When pulmonary toxicity occurs, the agent is discontinued and patients are treated with steroids and other supportive therapies.</p>
<p class="indent">Capillary leak syndrome with resultant pulmonary edema is an effect of cytarabine, mitomycin C, cyclophosphamide, and carmustine (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Subtle onset of dyspnea and cough may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress and subsequent respiratory failure. Patients who are at significant risk for capillary leak syndrome are monitored closely.</p>
<p class="h7">Reproductive System</p>
<p class="nonindent">Testicular and ovarian function can be affected by chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in possible infertility (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Women may develop problems with ovulation or early menopause, whereas men may develop temporary or permanent azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa). Because treatment may damage reproductive cells, banking of sperm is often recommended for men before treatment is initiated (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1030">Oktay, Harvey, Partridge, et al., 2018</a>). Options available for women prior to initiation of chemotherapy include cryopreservation (freezing) of oocytes, embryos, or ovarian tissue. Patients and their partners are informed about potential changes in reproductive function resulting from chemotherapy. In addition, many chemotherapy agents are known or thought to be teratogenic. Therefore, patients are advised to use reliable methods of birth control while receiving chemotherapy and not to assume that infertility has resulted (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Neurologic System</p>
<p class="nonindent">Chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, a potentially dose-limiting toxicity, can affect the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Neurotoxicity characterized by metabolic encephalopathy can occur with ifosfamide, high-dose methotrexate, and cytarabine. With repeated doses, the taxanes and plant alkaloids, especially vincristine, can cause cumulative peripheral nervous system damage with sensory alterations in the feet and hands. These sensations can be described as tingling, pricking, or numbness of the extremities; burning or freezing pain; sharp, stabbing, or electric shock&#x2013;like pain; and extreme sensitivity to touch. If unreported by patients or undetected, progressive motor axon damage can lead to loss of deep tendon reflexes, with muscle weakness, loss of balance and coordination, and paralytic ileus.</p>
<p class="indent">Some chemotherapy agents (e.g., paclitaxel and gemcitabine) can cause severe peripheral neuropathies that may lead to diminished quality of life and functional abilities and result in dose reductions, a change in chemotherapy regimen, or early cessation of treatment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib980">Haryani, Fetzer, Wu, et al., 2017</a>). Although often reversible, these side effects may take many months to resolve or persist indefinitely. Along with the usual paresthesias of the hands and feet, oxaliplatin has a unique and frightening neurotoxicity presentation that is often precipitated by exposure to cold and is characterized by pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia consisting of lip paresthesia, discomfort or tightness in the back of the throat, inability to breathe, and jaw pain (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients receiving oxaliplatin must be instructed to avoid drinking cold fluids or going outside with hands and feet exposed to cold temperatures to avoid exacerbation of these symptoms for 3 to 4 days after therapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Cisplatin may cause peripheral neuropathies and hearing loss due to damage to the acoustic nerve.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Cognitive Impairment</p>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients with cancer have trouble with remembering dates, multitasking, managing numbers and finances, organization, face or object recognition, inability to follow directions, feeling easily distracted, and motor and behavioral changes. Although not completely understood, these are viewed as symptoms of cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment is a multidimensional concept involving a decline in information-handling processes in several domains, including attention and concentration, executive function, information processing speed, language, motor function, visuospatial skill, learning, and memory (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jansen, 2017</a>). Commonly referred to by patients as &#x201C;chemo brain&#x201D; or &#x201C;chemo fog,&#x201D; cognitive impairment has been associated with both cancer and cancer treatments, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted agents. The symptoms may be subtle or profound with potential negative effects on functional abilities, employment, independence, quality of life, and psychosocial status. Comorbidities, age, medications, pain, impaired nutrition, anemia, fatigue, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, organ dysfunction, infection, and hormonal imbalances are factors that may contribute to the experience of cognitive impairment and make it difficult to fully understand. Underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment in patients with cancer being explored include neurotoxic effects, oxidative stress, hormonal changes, immune dysregulation, cytokine release, clotting, genetic predisposition, and accelerated aging processes (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jansen, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Fatigue</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer-related fatigue has been defined as an unusual, persistent, and subjective sense of tiredness that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning (NCCN, 2019f). Fatigue is a distressing side effect for most patients that greatly affects quality of life, during treatment and for months after treatment. The health care team works together to identify effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches for fatigue management.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Nurses play an important role in assessing and managing many of the problems experienced by patients receiving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents affect both normal and malignant cells; therefore, their effects are often widespread, affecting many body systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory and physical assessments of metabolic indices and the dermatologic, hematologic, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and pulmonary systems are critical in evaluating the body&#x2019;s response to chemotherapy. These assessments are performed prior to, during, and after a course of chemotherapy to determine optimal treatment options, evaluate the patient&#x2019;s response, and monitor toxicity. Patients are monitored for long-term effects of chemotherapy after active treatment has been completed during the period of survivorship (see <a href="#ct12-4">Chart&#x00A0;12-4</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Fluid and Electrolyte Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, altered taste, mucositis, and diarrhea put patients at risk for nutritional and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Therefore, it is important for the nurse to assess the patient&#x2019;s nutritional and fluid and electrolyte status on an ongoing basis and to identify creative ways to encourage an adequate fluid and dietary intake.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Cognitive Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses should assess patients routinely for indications of cognitive impairment. Prior to the initiation of treatment, patients and families should be informed about the possibility of cognitive impairment. Nursing assessment plays an important role in determining the need for referral for neurocognitive evaluation and intervention (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jansen, 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Modifying Risks for Infection and Bleeding</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Suppression of the bone marrow and immune system is expected and frequently serves as a guide in determining appropriate chemotherapy dosage but increases the risk of anemia, infection, and bleeding disorders. Nursing assessment and care address factors that would further increase the patient&#x2019;s risk. The nurse&#x2019;s role in decreasing the risk of infection and bleeding is discussed further in the Nursing Care of the Patient with Cancer section.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Administering Chemotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses must be aware of chemotherapy and other agents most associated with HSRs, strategies for prevention, signs and symptoms characteristic of HSRs, and the appropriate early and time-sensitive interventions for preventing progression to anaphylaxis. Nurses provide patient and family education that emphasizes two key points: the importance of adhering to prescribed self-administered premedication before presenting to the infusion center and recognizing and reporting the signs and symptoms to the nurse once the infusion has started. Patients and families are also educated about signs and symptoms that may occur at home following discharge from the infusion area that may warrant medication administration or immediate transport to the emergency department for further assessment and treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The local effects of the chemotherapeutic agent are also of concern. The patient is observed closely during administration of the agent because of the risk and consequences of extravasation. Prevention of extravasation is essential and relies on vigilant nursing care (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>). Selection of peripheral veins, skilled venipuncture, and careful administration of medications are essential. Peripheral administration is limited to short duration (less than 1 hour; IV push or bolus) infusions using only a soft, plastic catheter placed in the forearm area (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Continuous infusion of vesicants that takes longer than 1 hour or are given frequently are given only via a central line, such as a right atrial silastic catheter, implanted venous access device, or PICC. These long-term venous access devices promote safety during medication administration and reduce problems with repeated access to the circulatory system (see <a href="#ff12-3">Figs. 12-3</a> and <a href="#ff12-4">12-4</a>). Indwelling or subcutaneous venous access devices require consistent nursing care. Complications include infection and thrombosis (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1049">Voog, Campion, Du Rusquec, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Indications of extravasation during administration of vesicant agents include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Absence of blood return from the IV catheter</span></li>
<li><span>Resistance to flow of IV fluid</span></li>
<li><span>Burning or pain, swelling, or redness at the site</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">An extravasation kit should be readily available with emergency equipment and antidote medications, as well as a quick reference for how to properly manage an extravasation of the specific vesicant agent used (although evidence-based data regarding effective antidotes are limited) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Nurses should refer to their organization&#x2019;s policy and procedures for reporting, managing, and documenting extravasation. Safety standards require the availability of defined extravasation management procedures, including antidote order sets and accessibility of antidotes in all settings where vesicant chemotherapy is given (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>). Recommendations and guidelines for managing vesicant extravasation, which vary with each agent, have been issued by individual medication manufacturers, pharmacies, and the ONS (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Difficulties or problems with administration of chemotherapeutic agents are brought to the attention of the primary provider promptly so that corrective measures can be taken to minimize local tissue damage.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse evaluates the patient receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy, communicates findings with the medical oncologist, provides education to patients and families, and makes appropriate referrals for complete neurologic evaluation and occupational or rehabilitative therapies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Nausea and Vomiting</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses are integral to the prevention and management of CINV. They collaborate with other members of the oncology care team to identify factors contributing to the experience of CINV and select effective antiemetic regimens that maximize currently available therapies. Nurses provide education for patients and families regarding antiemetic regimens and care for delayed CINV that may continue at home after the chemotherapy infusion has completed (NCCN, 2019g).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Cognitive Changes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although several approaches have been explored, no evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, treatment, or management of cognitive impairment have been established. Examples of nonpharmacologic approaches that nurses recommend to patients include exercise, natural restorative environmental intervention (walking in nature or gardening), and cognitive training programs (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Jansen, 2017</a>). Nurses should assist patients to address factors, such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, nutrition deficits, fatigue, pain, and infection to minimize their contribution to cognitive impairment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Fatigue</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fatigue is a common side effect of chemotherapy. Nurses assist patients to explore the role that the underlying disease processes, combined treatments, other symptoms, and psychosocial distress play in the patient&#x2019;s experience of fatigue. In addition, nurses work with the patient and other team members to identify effective approaches for fatigue management (NCCN, 2019h).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s402">Protecting Caregivers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses involved in handling chemotherapeutic agents may be exposed to low doses of the agents by direct contact, inhalation, or ingestion (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1001">Menonna-Quinn, Polovich, &#x0026; Marshall, 2019</a>). Skin and eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, nasal mucosal ulcerations, infertility, low-birth-weight babies, congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and mutagenic substances in urine have been reported in nurses preparing and handling chemotherapy agents. The Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA), the ONS, hospitals, and other health care agencies have developed specific precautions for health care providers involved in the preparation and administration of chemotherapy and for handling materials exposed to body fluids of those who have received these hazardous agents (see <a href="#ct12-5">Chart&#x00A0;12-5</a>) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Neuss et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Nurses must be familiar with their institutional policies and procedures regarding personal protective equipment, handling and disposal of chemotherapy agents and supplies, and management of accidental spills or exposures. Emergency spill kits should be readily available in any treatment area where chemotherapy is prepared or given. Precautions must also be taken when handling any bodily fluids or excreta from the patient, as many agents are excreted unaltered in urine and feces. Nurses in all treatment settings have a responsibility to educate patients, families, caregivers, assistive personnel, and housekeepers concerning precautions.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s403">Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</h3>
<p class="nonindent">HSCT has been used to treat several malignant and nonmalignant diseases for many years (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). In adults, HSCT is most commonly used to treat certain hematologic malignancies (e.g., malignant myeloma, acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and less commonly some solid tumors (e.g., germ cell tumors, breast cancer, neuroblastomas).</p>
<p class="indent">The process of obtaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has evolved over the years (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Historically, HSCs were obtained in the operating room by harvesting large amounts of bone marrow tissue from a donor under general anesthesia. However, peripheral blood stem cell collection using the process of apheresis now accounts for the vast majority of HSCT procedures (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). The cells collected are specially processed and reinfused into the patient. This method of collecting HSCs is a safe and a more cost-effective means of collection than the process of harvesting of marrow. Stem cells can also be collected from umbilical cord blood harvested from the placenta of newborns at birth that is cryopreserved and stored for later use (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s404">Types of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Types of HSCT are based on the source of donor cells and the treatment (conditioning) regimen used to prepare the patient for stem cell infusion and eradicate malignant cells (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). These include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Allogeneic HSCT</em> (AlloHSCT): From a donor other than the patient (may be a related donor such as a family member or a matched unrelated donor from the National Bone Marrow Registry or Cord Blood Registry)</span></li>
<li><span><em>Autologous:</em> From the patient</span></li>
<li><span><em>Syngeneic:</em> From an identical twin</span></li>
<li><span><em>Myeloablative:</em> Consists of giving patients high-dose chemotherapy and, occasionally, total-body irradiation</span></li>
<li><span><em>Nonmyeloablative:</em> Also called <em>mini-transplants;</em> does not completely destroy bone marrow cells</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">AlloHSCTs are used primarily for diseases of the bone marrow and are dependent on the availability of a human leukocyte antigen&#x2013;matched donor, which greatly limits the number of possible transplants. An advantage of AlloHSCT is that the transplanted cells should not be immunologically tolerant of a patient&#x2019;s malignancy and should cause a lethal <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;graft-versus-tumor effect:&lt;/b&gt; the donor immune cell response against the malignancy; a desirable response">graft-versus-tumor effect</button></strong> in which the donor cells recognize the malignant cells and act to eliminate them.</p>
<p class="indent">AlloHSCT may involve either myeloablative (high-dose) or nonmyeloablative (mini-transplant) chemotherapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). In ablative AlloHSCT, the recipient receives high doses of chemotherapy and possibly total-body irradiation to completely eradicate (ablate) the bone marrow and any malignant cells and help prevent rejection of the donor stem cells. The collected HSCs that are infused IV into the recipients travel to sites in the body where they produce bone marrow and establish themselves through the process of engraftment. Once engraftment is complete (8 to 10 days, sometimes longer), the new bone marrow becomes functional and begins producing RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. In nonablative AlloHSCT, the chemotherapy doses are lower and aimed at destroying malignant cells (without completely eradicating the bone marrow), thus suppressing the recipient&#x2019;s immune system to allow engraftment of donor stem cells. The lower doses of chemotherapy, associated with less organ toxicity and infection, can be used for older patients or those with underlying organ dysfunction for whom high-dose chemotherapy would be prohibitive (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). After engraftment, it is hoped that the donor cells will create a graft-versus-tumor effect. Before engraftment, patients are at high risk for infection, sepsis, and bleeding. Side effects of the high-dose chemotherapy and total-body irradiation can be acute and chronic (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Negrin, 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Acute side effects include headache, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney injury. Chronic side effects include infertility; pulmonary, cardiac, liver, and kidney dysfunction; osteoporosis and avascular bone necrosis; diabetes; and secondary malignancies.</p>
<p class="indent">During the first 30 days after the conditioning regimen, AlloHSCT patients are at risk for developing hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (HSOS) (previously referred to as veno-oclusive disease) related to chemotherapy-induced inflammation of the sinusoidal epithelium (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Negrin &#x0026; Bonis, 2019</a>). Inflammation causes embolization of RBCs, resulting in destruction, fibrosis, and occlusion of the sinusoids. Clinical manifestations of HSOS may include weight gain, hepatomegaly, increased bilirubin, and ascites. Although various approaches have been used to treat HSOS, evidence-based strategies have not emerged. The use of peripheral stem cells, specific chemotherapy dosing, and nonmyeloablative regimens have been associated with a decreased incidence (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Negrin, 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;graft-versus-host disease (GVHD):&lt;/b&gt; an immune response initiated by T lymphocytes of donor tissue against the recipient&#x2019;s tissues (skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver); an undesirable response">Graft-versus-host disease</button></strong> (GVHD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 30% to 50% of the allogeneic transplant population, occurs when the donor lymphocytes initiate an immune response against the recipient&#x2019;s tissues (e.g., skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver) during the beginning of engraftment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). The donor cells view the recipient&#x2019;s tissues as foreign or immunologically different from what they recognize as &#x201C;self&#x201D; in the donor. To prevent GVHD, patients receive immunosuppressant drugs, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil.</p>
<p class="indent">GVHD may be acute, occurring within the first 100 days, or chronic, occurring after 100 days (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Clinical manifestations of acute GVHD include diffuse rash progressing to blistering and desquamation similar to second-degree burns; mucosal inflammation of the eyes and the entire gastrointestinal tract with subsequent diarrhea that may exceed 2 L per day; and biliary stasis with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes progressing to obstructive jaundice. The first 100 days or so after AlloHSCT is crucial for patients; the immune system and blood-making capacity (hematopoiesis) must recover sufficiently to prevent infection and hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="indent">Autologous HSCT (AuHSCT) is considered for patients with disease of the bone marrow who do not have a suitable donor for AlloHSCT or for patients who have healthy bone marrow but require bone marrow&#x2013;ablative doses of chemotherapy to cure an aggressive malignancy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). The most common malignancies treated with AuHSCT include lymphoma and multiple myeloma. However, the use of AuHSCT has gained increasing acceptance in treating neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and germ cell tumors. Stem cells are collected from the patient and preserved for reinfusion; if necessary, they are treated to kill any malignant cells within the marrow, called <em>purging.</em> The patient is then treated with ablative chemotherapy and, possibly, total-body irradiation to eradicate any remaining tumor. Stem cells are then reinfused. Until engraftment occurs in the bone marrow sites of the body, there is a high risk of infection, sepsis, and bleeding. Acute and chronic toxicities from chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be severe. The risk of HSOS is also present after autologous transplantation. No immunosuppressant medications are necessary after AuHSCT, because the patient does not receive foreign tissue. A disadvantage of AuHSCT is the risk that tumor cells may remain in the bone marrow despite high-dose chemotherapy (conditioning regimens).</p>
<p class="indent">Syngeneic transplants result in less incidence of GVHD and graft rejection; however, there is also less graft-versus-tumor effect to fight the malignancy. For this reason, even when an identical twin is available for marrow donation, another matched sibling or even an unrelated donor may be the most suitable donor to combat an aggressive malignancy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s405">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care of the patient undergoing HSCT is complex and demands a high level of skill. The success of HSCT is greatly influenced by nursing care throughout the transplantation process.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Implementing Care Before Treatment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">All patients must undergo extensive evaluations before HSCT to assess the current clinical status of the disease. Nutritional assessments, extensive physical examinations, organ function tests, and psychological evaluations are conducted. Blood work includes assessing past infectious antigen exposure (e.g., hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis). The patient&#x2019;s social support systems and financial and insurance resources are also evaluated. Informed consent and patient education about the procedure and care before and after HSCT are vital.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Care During Treatment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Skilled nursing care is required during the treatment phase of HSCT when high-dose chemotherapy (conditioning regimen) and total-body irradiation are given. The acute toxicities of nausea, diarrhea, mucositis, and hemorrhagic cystitis require close monitoring and symptom management by the nurse.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing management during stem cell infusion consists of monitoring the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and blood oxygen saturation; assessing for adverse effects, such as fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, cutaneous reactions, nausea, vomiting, hypotension or hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, and taste changes; and providing strategies for symptom control, ongoing support, and patient education. During stem cell infusion, patients may experience adverse reactions to the cryoprotectant dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) used to preserve the harvested stem cells. Less common toxicities include neurologic and renal impairment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Until engraftment of the new marrow occurs, the patient undergoing HSCT is at high risk for death from sepsis and bleeding.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">A cluster of symptoms referred to as engraftment syndrome may occur during the neutrophil recovery phase in both allogeneic and autologous transplants. Clinical features of this syndrome vary widely but may include noninfectious fever associated with skin rash, weight gain, diarrhea, and pulmonary infiltrates, with improvement noted after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy rather than antibiotic therapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Mutahar &#x0026; Al-Anazi, 2017</a>). Until engraftment is well established, the patient requires support with blood products and hematopoietic growth factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Potential infections may be bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan in origin. During the first 30 days following transplant, the patient is most at risk for developing reactivations of viral infections, including herpes simplex, EBV, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster. Mucosal denudement poses a risk for <em>Candida</em> (yeast) infection locally and systemically. Pulmonary toxicities offer the opportunity for fungal infections such as <em>Aspergillus.</em> Renal complications arise from the nephrotoxic chemotherapy agents used in the conditioning regimen or those used to treat infection (amphotericin B, aminoglycosides). A neutropenic diet is usually prescribed for patients to decrease the risk of exposure to foodborne infections from bacteria, yeast, molds, viruses, and parasites (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 328</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page329" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="329">p. 329</span></div>
<p class="indent">Tumor lysis syndrome and acute tubular necrosis are also potential complications after HSCT. Nursing assessment for signs of these complications is essential for early identification and treatment. GVHD requires skillful nursing assessment to detect early effects on the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. HSOS resulting from the conditioning regimens used can result in fluid retention, jaundice, abdominal pain, ascites, tender and enlarged liver, and encephalopathy. Pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonia, and other pneumonias, often complicate recovery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Care After Treatment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care following HSCT includes care of recipients and donors. These are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p class="h7">Caring for Recipients</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ongoing nursing assessment during follow-up visits is essential to detect late effects of therapy after HSCT, which may occur 100 days or more after the procedure (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Late effects include infections (e.g., varicella-zoster infection), restrictive pulmonary abnormalities, and recurrent pneumonias. Infertility often results due to total-body irradiation, chemotherapy, or both as components of the ablative regimen. Chronic GVHD can involve the skin, liver, intestine, esophagus, eyes, lungs, joints, and vaginal mucosa. Cataracts may also develop after total-body irradiation.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a high potential of psychological distress following an HSCT, which has been associated with delayed recovery, mortality, and increased rates of complications, such as GVHD (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib983">Hermioni, Christina, Melanie, et al., 2019</a>). Thus, psychosocial assessments by nursing staff must be ongoing and a priority. In addition to the multiple physical and psychological stressors affecting patients at each phase of the transplantation experience, the nature of the treatment and patient experience can place extreme emotional, social, financial, and physical demands on family, friends, and donors. Nurses assess the family and other caregivers&#x2019; needs and provide education, support, and information about resources.</p>
<p class="h7">Caring for Donors</p>
<p class="nonindent">Like HSCT recipients, donors also require nursing care. They may experience mood alterations, decreased self-esteem, and guilt from feelings of failure if the transplantation fails. Family members must be educated and supported to reduce anxiety and promote coping during this difficult time. In addition, they must also be assisted to maintain realistic expectations of themselves as well as of the patient.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s406">Immunotherapy and Targeted Therapy</h3>
<h5 class="h5" id="s407">Immunotherapy</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immunotherapy:&lt;/b&gt; the use of medications or other agents to stimulate or suppress components of the immune system to kill cancer cells">Immunotherapy</button></strong> involves the use of medications or biochemical mediators to stimulate or suppress components of the immune system to kill cancer cells (ACS, 2019g). Over the past decade, advances in the understanding of the immune system and about its interaction with cancer have led to significant advances in immunotherapy. This has dramatically changed how patients with cancer are treated and has resulted in improvements in overall survival for many forms of cancer. There are several types of immunotherapy currently being used to treat cancer, including nonspecific immunotherapies, monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#x2013;cell therapy. Many immunotherapies are targeted therapies. Targeted therapies are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nonspecific Immunotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nonspecific immunotherapy does not target the cancer cell directly, but rather boosts the immune system to enhance cancer cell destruction alone or along with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy (ACS, 2019f). Common nonspecific immunotherapy agents include bacille Calmette-Gu&#x00E9;rin (BCG) and cytokines (interferon, interleukins, and colony-stimulating factors).</p>
<p class="indent">BCG is one of the earliest immunotherapy agents used to treat cancer. BCG is a live attenuated strain of <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em>, which is closely related to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis in people. BCG is most commonly used to treat localized bladder cancer (ACS, 2019h). When instilled into the bladder, BCG serves as an antigen to stimulate an immune response. The intention is that the stimulated immune system will then eradicate malignant cells. Common toxicities associated with BCG therapy include mild flulike symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, malaise), bladder burning/discomfort, urinary frequency, and blood tinged urine, which typically last 2 to 3 days after treatment (ACS, 2019h).</p>
<p class="indent">The most commonly used nonspecific immunotherapy agents are cytokines. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytokines:&lt;/b&gt; messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)">Cytokines</button></strong> are messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; they are also called <em>biochemical</em> or <em>inflammatory mediators.</em> These substances are produced primarily by cells of the immune system to enhance or suppress the production and functioning of other components of the immune system and thus can be used to treat cancer or the adverse effects of some cancer treatments. Cytokines are grouped into families, such as interferons (IFNs), interleukins (ILs), and colony-stimulating factors. Colony-stimulating factors were described earlier in this chapter for their supportive role in myelosuppressive treatment modalities. (Refer to <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> for more detailed discussion of the immune system.)</p>
<p class="indent">IFNs are cytokines with antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory (inhibition or stimulation of the immune system) properties. Multiple antitumor effects of IFNs include antiangiogenesis, direct destruction of tumor cells, inhibition of growth factors, and disruption of the cell cycle (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). IFNs are used on a limited basis for the treatment of some solid and hematologic cancers. Similar to IFNs, ILs have immunomodulatory effects on other components of the immune response. IL-2, an interleukin made in a laboratory, has been approved as a treatment option for advanced kidney cancer and metastatic melanoma in adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Adverse effects such as fever, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting, as seen with IFN and IL-2 therapy, may not be life-threatening. However, other adverse effects with these therapies (e.g., capillary leak syndrome, pulmonary edema, hypotension) may become life-threatening. These severe toxicities have restricted the use of IFN and IL-2 clinically and have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page330" title="330"></span>prompted clinicians to seek alternative anticancer therapies (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Waldmann, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monoclonal Antibodies (MoAbs)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">MoAbs, another type of immunotherapy, have become available through technologic advances, enabling investigators to grow and produce targeted antibodies for specific malignant cells. Theoretically, this type of specificity allows MoAbs to destroy the cancer cells and spare normal cells. The specificity of MoAbs is dependent on identifying key antigen proteins on the surface (outside) of tumors that are not present on normal tissues. When the MoAb attaches to the cell surface antigen, an important signal transduction pathway for communication between the malignant cells and the extracellular environment is blocked. The results may include an inability to initiate apoptosis, reproduce, or invade surrounding tissues.</p>
<p class="indent">The production of MoAbs involves injecting tumor cells that act as antigens into mice. B-cell lymphocytes in the spleen of the mouse produce immunoglobulin (antibodies) made in response to the injected antigens. Antibody-producing B-cells are combined with a cancer cell that can grow indefinitely in culture medium and continue producing more antibodies.</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of spleen cells and the cancer cells is referred to as a hybridoma. From hybridomas that continue to grow in the culture medium, the desired antibodies are harvested, purified, and prepared for diagnostic or therapeutic use (see <a href="#ff12-5">Fig.&#x00A0;12-5</a>). Advances in genetic engineering have led to the production of MoAbs with combinations of mouse and human components (<em>chimeric MoAbs</em>) or all-human components (<em>human MoAbs</em>). MoAbs made with human genes have greater immunologic properties and are less likely to cause allergic and infusion reactions (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff12-5">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff12-5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff12-5.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;12-5 &#x2022;</span> Antibody-producing spleen cells are fused with cancer cells. This process produces cells called <em>hybridomas.</em> These cells, which can grow indefinitely in a culture medium, produce antibodies that are harvested, purified, and prepared for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">MoAbs (with names usually ending in -mab) are large particles that work on extracellular molecules, which are usually administered intravenously. Several MoAbs are used for the treatment in cancer using various extracellular (on the cell membrane) and intracellular targets. Trastuzumab targets the HER2 protein, an error of gene overexpression found in breast and other cancers (ACS, 2019g). Rituxumab is a MoAb that binds specifically with the CD20 antigen expressed by non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Some MoAbs are used alone (termed naked MoAbs), whereas others are used in combination with agents that facilitate their antitumor actions (termed conjugated MoAbs). Ibritumomab tiuxetan, a MoAb conjugated with a radioactive isotope, is used in the treatment of certain types of lymphoma (ACS, 2019g). MoAbs are also used as aids in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page331" title="331"></span>diagnostic evaluation of both primary and metastatic tumors through radiologic imaging and laboratory techniques (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). For example, the process of immunohistochemistry uses a MoAb tagged with a stain that binds with the protein of interest, providing a visual stain for the presence or absence of the protein (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib956">Bishop, Cole, Zhang, et al., 2018</a>). This type of test is used to identify the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors on breast cancer cells to see if the cells will be responsive to hormonal agents. Immunohistochemistry testing is also used to detect several proteins associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancers. MoAbs are used to assist in the diagnosis of ovarian, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers and some types of leukemia and lymphoma. MoAbs are also used in purging residual tumor cells from peripheral stem cell collections for patients who are undergoing HSCT after high-dose cytotoxic therapy. Researchers continue to explore the development and use of MoAbs, either alone or in combination with other substances such as radioactive materials, chemotherapy agents, toxins, and hormones.</p>
<p class="indent">MoAbs are associated with both common and unique toxicities (ACS, 2019g). Common toxicities associated with MoAbs include flulike symptoms (e.g., chills, weakness, malaise) headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, rash, proteinuria, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and hepatoxicity. Although mild to moderate allergic and infusion reactions are more commonly associated with chimeric MoAbs, severe HSRs have been seen with MoAb infusions. Other toxicities are specific to the substance attached to the MoAbs.</p>
<p class="h7">Checkpoint Inhibitors</p>
<p class="nonindent">The immune system uses inhibitory and acceleratory pathways and immune checkpoints to regulate the antitumor response (ACS, 2019g; Bayer, Amaya, Baniewicz, et al., 2017). Checkpoints are specific proteins on T&#x2013;cells that need to be blocked (or inactivated) to initiate an immune response against cancer cells. Cancer cells use different mechanisms to avoid recognition by the immune system, thus allowing them to grow unchecked. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block proteins that diminish immune system function and prevent T lymphocytes from identifying and destroying cancer cells. When these mechanisms are blocked, the &#x201C;brakes are off&#x201D; and T&#x2013;cells are released, allowing the immune system to identify and mount an immune response against cancer cells (this is termed an antitumor response).</p>
<p class="indent">Recently, special type of MoAbs were developed that block specific checkpoints on T&#x2013;cells to enhance cancer cell surveillance and destruction by the immune system. These MoAbs are called check point inhibitors. Three classes of checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor, and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). The CTLA-4 is an intracellular protein within resting T lymphocytes. CTLA receptors on certain T&#x2013;cells prevent the overactivation of the immune response; thus, blocking this receptor allows for a persistent T&#x2013;cell antitumor response (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bayer et al., 2017</a>). An example of an immune check point inhibitor that blocks CTLA-4 is ipilimumab. Ipilimumab is currently approved for some forms of melanoma, colorectal cancer, and kidney cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">PD-1 is a checkpoint protein on activated T&#x2013;cells that when bound to another protein called PD-L1 prevents the immune system from mounting a response against normal cells (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). PD-L1 is also located on some cancer cells, which disrupts immune surveillance and the antitumor response, thus allowing cancer cells to grow unchecked. Immune checkpoint inhibitors that block PD-1 (e.g., nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (e.g., atezolizumab, avelumab, durvvalumab) are used to treat a wide range of cancers, including: melanoma of the skin, non&#x2013;small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
<p class="indent">Immune checkpoint inhibitors exhibit a different toxicity profile from other anticancer therapies. Thus, the unique toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are termed &#x201C;immune-related adverse events&#x201D; (irAes). These irAes are thought to be related to an inflammatory response to immune-related activity that can affect any organ or organ system; however, the exact etiology is not fully known (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). IrAes often present with a delayed onset and the severity of toxicities can range from mild to potentially life-threatening. The most common irAes include dermatologic (e.g., rash and pruritus); gastrointestinal (e.g., diarrhea and colitis); pulmonary (e.g., pneumonitis); renal (e.g., nephritis); endocrine (e.g., hypophysitis [inflammation of the pituitary gland], thyroiditis, hyper- and hypothyroidism) toxicities. Prompt recognition of immune-related toxicities is essential to prevent treatment delays and to ensure prompt initiation of effective management strategies, which often include the use of anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteroids (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cancer Vaccines</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer vaccines mobilize the body&#x2019;s immune response to prevent or treat cancer. These vaccines contain either portions of cancer cells alone or portions of cells in combination with other substances (adjuvants) that can augment or boost immune responses. <em>Autologous</em> vaccines are made from the patient&#x2019;s own cancer cells, which are taken from tumor tissue obtained during biopsy or surgical intervention. The cancer cells are killed and prepared for injection back into the patient. <em>Allogeneic</em> vaccines are made from cancer cell lines that are immortalized cells that were originally obtained from other people who had a specific type of cancer. These cancer cells are grown in a laboratory and eventually killed and prepared for injection.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Prophylactic</em> vaccines prevent disease. Three vaccines have been approved by the FDA for the prevention of HPV. HPV2 (Cervarix), recommended for use in females only, protects against HPV types 16 and 18 that are responsible for about 70% of all cervical cancers (ACS, 2019g). HPV4 (Gardasil) provides protection against four HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18) and is recommended for use in both genders. HPV9 (Gardasil-9), recommended for both males and females, protects against nine HPV types associated with cervical, anal, vaginal, and vulvar cancers. HPV9 also protects against genital warts. All of the HPV vaccines are given as a series of three doses over 6 months. Although the role of HPV vaccines in prevention of oropharyngeal cancers related to HPV16 has not been fully established, there are preliminary data to suggest effectiveness (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1053">Wang, Dickie, Sutavani, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Vaccines are also used to treat existing disease. Therapeutic vaccines kill existing cancer cells and inhibit further cancer development. Sipuleucel-T (ACS, 2019g) is indicated for men with metastatic prostate cancer that is no longer responding to hormone therapy. It is the only therapeutic vaccine currently FDA approved. Therapeutic vaccines do not cure cancer but are associated with improved patient survival.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T&#x2013;Cell Immunotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A new addition to the treatment of cancer with immunotherapy is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#x2013;cell therapy. CAR T&#x2013;cell is a type of targeted immunotherapy that uses tumor-specific antigen recognition to target specific malignancies. CAR T&#x2013;cell therapy involves the use of genetically modified T&#x2013;cells to kill cancer cells (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Lamprecht &#x0026; Dansereau, 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). For example, in CART-19 therapy, cluster of differentiation (CD)&#x2013;19 is the target antigen. This antigen is commonly overexpressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bayer et al., 2017</a>). The only two CAR T&#x2013;cell immunotherapy agents currently FDA-approved both target CD19 (tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel). Tisagenlecleucel is approved to treat adults with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma and young adults (up to 25 years old) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Axicabtagene and ciloleucel are approved to treat certain types of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The process of making CAR genetically modified T&#x2013;cells begins with collecting T&#x2013;cells. T&#x2013;cells may be collected from the patient (autologous) or collected from a healthy donor (allogeneic) using leukapheresis. The T&#x2013;cells are sent to the laboratory where they are genetically altered by adding a specific chimeric antigen receptor. This process takes several weeks to make enough CAR T&#x2013;cells needed for therapy. When there are enough CAR T&#x2013;cells (based on the patient&#x2019;s body weight), the cells are infused to the patient in a procedure similar to a blood transfusion (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Lamprecht &#x0026; Dansereau, 2019</a>). A few days before a CAR T&#x2013;cell infusion, the patient may be given chemotherapy to reduce the number of other immune cells to make room for the new CAR T&#x2013;cells to expand and proliferate. Once infused, the CAR T&#x2013;cells will continue to grow (up to a year or more postinfusion) while binding with tumor-specific antigen to kill cancer cells.</p>
<p class="indent">The two most common toxicities related to CAR T&#x2013;cell therapy are CRS and neurologic toxicities (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Anderson &#x0026; Latchford, 2019</a>). CRS, also referred to as cytokine storm, is the most common toxicity of CAR T&#x2013;cell therapy and is experienced to some degree by most patients. During therapy, the infused CAR T&#x2013;cells and other immune cells stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines resulting in a systemic inflammatory response, which usually occurs within a few days of treatment. Clinical manifestations of CRS most commonly include fever (hallmark sign), tachycardia, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, and fatigue. Although, if the CRS is severe, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, respiratory distress, coagulopathies, and end-organ toxicities may occur (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Anderson &#x0026; Latchford, 2019</a>). Neurologic toxicities can range from a headache and mild confusion to cerebral edema or intracranial hemorrhage. Although the exact etiology of neurologic toxicities related to CAR T&#x2013;cell therapy is not yet known, it has been postulated that increased vascular permeability, increased cytokine levels, and the ability of the cells to cross the blood&#x2013;brain barriers may be factors (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Anderson &#x0026; Latchford, 2019</a>). Other toxicities seen with CAR T&#x2013;cell therapy include tumor lysis syndrome, myelosuppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), and hypogammaglobulinemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s408">Targeted Therapies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Normal cell growth is regulated by well-defined communication pathways between the environment surrounding the cell and the internal cell environment, the nucleus, and the intracellular cytoplasm. The cell membrane contains important protein receptors that respond to signals transmitted from the external cell environment and transmit that signal to the internal cell environment using enzymatic pathways called <em>signal transduction pathways.</em> Although normal cells have transduction pathways, scientific advances have led to the recognition that cancer, at the cellular level, is characterized by deregulated cell signaling transduction pathways (both intra- and extracellular pathways), as well as altered cell membrane receptors and proteins that play an important role in tumor initiation, growth, and spread (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Norris, 2019</a>). This improved understanding of cancer cell behavior has allowed scientists to develop molecular-based therapies, called targeted therapies.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;targeted therapies:&lt;/b&gt; the use of medications or other agents to kill or prevent the spread of cancer cells by targeting specific part of the cell, with less negative effects on healthy cells">Targeted therapies</button></strong> involve the use of agents to kill or prevent the spread of cancer cells by targeting a specific part of the cell, with less negative effects on healthy cells than conventional chemotherapy. These agents specifically target (like a lock and key mechanism) receptors, proteins, signal transduction pathways, and other processes to prevent the continued growth of cancer cells (NCI, 2019d). Targeted therapies allow for cancer treatment to be &#x201C;personalized&#x201D; to the unique molecular basis of the patient&#x2019;s cancer. To determine if a patient would benefit from a targeted therapy, the patient&#x2019;s cancer cells must be evaluated in the laboratory to determine if they have enough of the target molecule for the therapy to be effective. Thus, not all patients with the same type of cancer may benefit from the same targeted treatment. New unique molecular targets are regularly being identified, resulting in the discovery of many new targeted agents over the past decade (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are two main types of targeted therapies: monoclonal antibodies (previously discussed in the immunotherapy section) and small molecule drugs. Small molecule drugs (with names usually ending in -nib) target specific molecules on the inside of the cancer cells and are usually administered orally. Targeted therapies are further classified in accordance with their mechanism of action (or the unique molecule targeted) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). There is a good amount of overlap in the mechanism of action of these agents because many targeted therapies work via complex pathways and have more than one target molecule. An overview of common categories of targeted therapies including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor inhibitors, multikinase inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors are discussed below using small molecule drugs as exemplars.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors</em> block a group of enzymes called tyrosine kinases, which regulate many cellular functions including signaling cellular growth and division (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Overexpression (too much) of tyrosine kinase is found in some cancer cells. Blocking these enzymes may prevent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page333" title="333"></span>cancer cell growth. An example of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is imatinib mesylate, which is used to treat cancers with an overexpression of BCR-ABL, such as chronic myeloid leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors</em> block a specific surface protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is present on both normal and cancer cells. The overexpression of EGF in cancer cells promotes division and growth; thus, blocking EGFR can result in decreased cancer cell proliferation (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). For example, erlotinib blocks the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF protein to reduce cancer cell growth. Elotinib is approved to treat advanced non&#x2013;small cell lung cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with chemotherapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor inhibitors</em> (VEGFRIs) are agents that block vascular endothelial growth factor, which is produced by cells to stimulate <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;angiogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; growth of new blood vessels that allow cancer cells to grow">angiogenesis</button></strong> (the growth of new blood vessels). As such, VEGFRIs inhibit angiogenesis, which prevents cancer cells from receiving adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. VEGFRIs are used to treat various types of cancer, including soft tissue sarcomas, and thyroid, lung, kidney, and colorectal cancers. For example, axitinib is a VEGFRI approved to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) after failure of one prior systemic therapy (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Multikinase inhibitors (MKIs)</em> inhibit several intracellular and extracellular (surface) kinases that play a role in cellular growth and metastatic processes to reduce cancer cell growth and replication (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Sorafenib is an example of an MKI that inhibits several kinase receptor pathways (e.g., c-KIT, PDGFR, RAF, RET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3). Sorafenib is used to treat several different cancer types including liver, kidney, and thyroid cancers.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Proteasome inhibitors</em> inhibit proteasome cellular complexes, that prevent certain enzymes from making proteins (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Proteasome helps maintain intracellular homeostasis by regulating proteins that facilitate cell division and prevent cell death. Thus, blocking proteasome interferes with cell division and enhances cancer cell death. An example of a proteasome inhibitor is bortezomib, which is approved to treat multiple myeloma and certain types of lymphoma (e.g., mantle cell lymphoma).</p>
<p class="indent">Common toxicities that occur with targeted therapies include mucositis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, skin rash, impaired wound healing, hypertension, and myelosuppression (decreased red blood cells, WBCs, and platelets) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Peripheral neuropathy can also occur with some proteasome inhibitors. More serious complications of targeted therapy include cardiotoxicity (e.g., brotezomib) and hepatoxicity (e.g., sorafenib).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s409">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients receiving immunotherapy and targeted therapy have many of the same needs as patients undergoing other conventional cancer treatments. However, manipulation and stimulation of the immune system also creates unique challenges (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bayer et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>). Nurses must be aware of the adverse effects of these therapies and recognize the signs and symptoms of serious reactions to emergently institute appropriate interventions and supportive care. Nurses monitor patients for the impact of adverse effects on performance status and quality of life so that appropriate measures can be implemented to improve patient outcomes. The nurse must also assist in planning and evaluating patient care, and assess the need for education, support, and additional resources for both the patient and the family.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient education is important, as many of the toxicities are not only a source of physical discomfort, but they may also affect quality of life and patient adherence to treatment (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>). Key points of education related to immunotherapy and targeted therapy include providing information about (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bayer et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Olsen et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Yarbro et al., 2018</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>prescribed treatment(s) and associated toxicities to allow for prompt recognition of potentially treatment-limiting (e.g., peripheral neuropathy) and life-threatening (i.e., heart and liver failure) toxicities;</span></li>
<li><span>the importance of reporting new symptoms or the exacerbation of existing symptoms promptly to the health care provider;</span></li>
<li><span>how and when to contact the primary provider and seek the assistance of emergency medical services; and</span></li>
<li><span>how to provide self-care during and after treatment.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patient and family education should also include attention to general standards of care relevant to all anticancer treatment (such as principles of infection control, hand hygiene, nutrition and hydration, safe sexual practices, good skin care) and instructions to notify the health care provider about any newly prescribed or over-the-counter medications, including herbs, vitamins, and dietary supplements (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Bayer et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates patients about self-care and assists in providing for continuing care. Some cancer immunotherapy and targeted therapies can be given subcutaneously (e.g., trastuzumab and denosumab) by the patient or family members at home. As needed, the home health nurse educates the patient and family how to administer these agents and monitors the use of appropriate technique as well as safe disposal of sharps and contaminated materials. The nurse also provides education about toxicities and helps the patient and family identify strategies to manage common side effects of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of oral medications to treat cancer has risen greatly in the past several years, especially with advances in targeted therapies, many of which are given by mouth. Since 2015, more than 50 oral anticancer medications were approved by FDA and it is estimated between 25% and 35% of all anticancer therapies being developed are orally administered (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib972">Dusetzina, Huskamp, Winn, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kays, 2018</a>). The rising use of oral therapies shifts the responsibility for delivery of treatment to patients and families in the home setting. Treatment approaches with newer mechanisms of action and associated toxicities, as well as the transition of responsibility to patients and families, increase the need for nurses to identify factors affecting adherence and to develop strategies to address adherence barriers (see <a href="#tt12-8">Table&#x00A0;12-8</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse collaborates with physicians, social workers, third-party payers, and pharmaceutical companies to help the patient obtain reimbursement or support for the cost of oral cancer therapies and other required medications (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Dusetzina et al., 2018</a>). The nurse also reminds the patient about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with the primary provider and assesses the patient&#x2019;s need for symptom management related to the underlying diseases or adverse effects of treatment. Home health nurses maintain communication with the primary provider regarding patient adherence and tolerance of treatment so that changes in care can be implemented in a timely fashion.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s410">Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Health Therapies</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Integrative health care is viewed as a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to preventing and treating illness and promoting health that brings together complementary, alternative, and conventional therapies. The use of an integrative approach to health and wellness has grown within mainstream health care settings in the United States, particularly within oncology care (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1009">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health [NCCIH], 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Individuals use complementary approaches to prevent and treat cancer, although there are no data to support efficacy. Patients also use complementary approaches to manage symptoms related to cancer and associated treatments; some approaches are supported by clinical research while others are not. It is estimated that as many as 67% of people diagnosed with cancer use some form of complementary medicine (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1052">Wanchai, Armer, Smith, et al., 2017</a>). However, many patients do not routinely communicate complementary practices to their health care providers because they usually are not asked about its use; they withhold the information, fearing that their provider would not approve, or they feel that the use of these approaches will not affect the conventional treatment they are receiving.</p>
<p class="indent">Although many complementary modalities can be a source of comfort and emotional support for patients, assessment of complementary therapy use is important for patient safety. Patients often perceive vitamins and dietary supplements as harmless, natural products that have no side effects or potential toxicities. In patients receiving any conventional therapies, the use of herbs or botanicals may interfere with drug metabolism, decrease or increase desired effects, or contain elements of uncertain pharmacologic capacities (NCCIH, 2018). Deep tissue massage and other manipulative therapies are contraindicated in patients with open wounds, radiodermatitis, thrombocytopenia, VTE, and coagulation disorders, and in those taking anticoagulants. See <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for more information on complementary, alternative, and integrative health therapies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s411"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Since that time, several risks for both severe acute respiratory syndrome <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page336" title="336"></span>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis to COVID-19 have been posed (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>). Epidemiologic findings from early data in China suggest that having cancer could be an important risk factor for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19 (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib967">Deng, Yin, Chen, et al., 2020</a>). Many cancer clinicians and researchers worldwide recognized during the early days of the pandemic that there was an urgent need to identify idiosyncratic risks and treatment issues that revolve around managing adults with both COVID-19 and cancer. As a result, the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) was established (see Resources section for link to CCC19). An early cohort study sponsored by CCC19 of 928 patients from the United States, Canada, and Spain with either a history of cancer or active malignancy identified prognostic factors for mortality and severe COVID-19 (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib994">Kuderer, Choueiri, Shah, et al., 2020</a>). Overall 13% of the patients died (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kuderer et al., 2020</a>), a higher mortality rate than the 5.6% case fatality rate for all adult patients in the United States with COVID-19 (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib989">Johns Hopkins University &#x0026; Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020</a>). The researchers identified the following factors as associated with an increase in 30-day mortality: older age, male sex, a history of smoking, having two or more comorbidities, having an active cancer, and having received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine during treatment for COVID-19 (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kuderer et al., 2020</a>). The four most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in these patients included fever, cough, fatigue or malaise, and dyspnea; the same as for all patients with COVID-19 (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kuderer et al., 2020</a>). There was no association between having recently had surgery and either having severe COVID-19 or dying, suggesting that surgery indicated for patients with cancer should not be postponed due to pandemic concerns (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kuderer et al., 2020</a>). CCC19 will continue to analyze registry data of patients with COVID-19 and cancer and publicize noteworthy findings as they become available, to facilitate optimal management of patients with COVID-19 and cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Kuderer et al., 2020</a>).</p>
