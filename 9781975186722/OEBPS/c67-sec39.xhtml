<h4 class="h4" id="s3254">Food Poisoning</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Food poisoning is a sudden illness that occurs after ingestion of contaminated food or drink. Botulism is a serious form of food poisoning that requires continual surveillance (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>, <a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#tt68-6">Table 68-6</a>). Assessment questions for patients with suspected food poisoning are discussed in <a href="#ct67-7">Chart 67-7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The key to treatment is determining the source and type of food poisoning. If possible, the suspected food should be brought to the medical facility and a history obtained from the patient or family.</p>
<p class="indent">Food, gastric contents, vomitus, serum, and feces are collected for examination. The patient&#x2019;s respirations, level of consciousness (LOC), blood pressure and hemodynamic status, and muscular activity are monitored closely. Measures are instituted to support the respiratory system. Death from respiratory paralysis can occur with botulism, fish poisoning, and some other food poisonings.</p>
<p class="indent">Because large volumes of electrolytes and water are lost by vomiting and diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte status should be assessed. Severe vomiting produces alkalosis, and severe diarrhea produces acidosis. Hypovolemic shock may also occur from severe fluid and electrolyte losses. The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, including lethargy, rapid pulse rate, fever, oliguria, anuria, hypotension, and delirium. Baseline weight and serum electrolyte levels are obtained for future comparisons.</p>
<p class="indent">Measures to control nausea are also important to prevent vomiting, which could exacerbate fluid and electrolyte imbalances. An antiemetic medication is given parenterally as prescribed if the patient cannot tolerate fluids or medications by mouth (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>). For mild nausea, the patient is encouraged to take sips of weak tea, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2205" title="2205"></span>carbonated drinks, or tap water. After nausea and vomiting subside, clear liquids are usually prescribed for 12 to 24 hours, and the diet is gradually progressed to a low-residue, bland diet.</p>

<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Food Poisoning</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Use the following questions to elicit information about the circumstances surrounding the possibility of food poisoning:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>How soon after eating did the symptoms occur? (Immediate onset suggests chemical, plant, or animal poisoning.)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What was eaten in the previous meal? Did the food have an unusual odor or taste? (Most foods causing bacterial poisoning <em>do not</em> have unusual odor or taste.)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Did anyone else become ill from eating the same food?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Did vomiting occur? What was the appearance of the vomitus?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Did diarrhea occur? (Diarrhea is usually absent with botulism and with shellfish or other fish poisoning.)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are any neurologic symptoms present? (These occur in botulism and in chemical, plant, and animal poisoning.)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Does the patient have a fever? (Fever is characteristic in salmonella, ingestion of fava beans, and some fish poisoning.)</p>
