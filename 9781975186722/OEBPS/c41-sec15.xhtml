<h4 class="h4" id="s1771">Anal Fissure</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An anal fissure is a longitudinal tear or ulceration in the lining of the anal canal usually just distal to the dentate line (see <a href="#ff41-12">Fig. 41-12B</a>). Fissures are usually caused by the trauma of passing a large, firm stool or from persistent tightening of the anal canal because of stress and anxiety (leading to constipation). Other causes include childbirth, trauma, and or anal intercourse.</p>
<p class="indent">Painful defecation, burning, and bleeding characterize fissures. Bright red blood may be seen on the toilet tissue after <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1335" title="1335"></span>a bowel movement. Most of these fissures heal if treated by conservative measures that include dietary modification with addition of fiber supplements, stool softeners and bulk agents, an increase in water intake, and sitz baths (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Poritz, 2018</a>). Anal dilation under anesthesia may be required. Therapies such as perianal or intra-anal application of nitroglycerin ointment, calcium channel blockers, minoxidil, or botulinum toxin injections have increased the rate of healing and lowered pain levels in chronic anal fissures; these therapies should be tried before surgery. These agents work by increasing blood supply to the region and relaxing the anal sphincter (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Poritz, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">If fissures do not respond to conservative treatment, surgery is indicated. The procedure of choice is the lateral internal sphincterotomy with excision of the fissure.</p>
