<h3 class="h3">GLOSSARY</h3>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">air trapping:</span> incomplete emptying of alveoli during expiration due to loss of lung tissue elasticity (emphysema), bronchospasm (asthma), or airway obstruction</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency:</span> genetic disorder resulting from deficiency of alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin, a protective agent for the lung; increases patient&#x2019;s risk for developing panacinar emphysema even in the absence of smoking</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">asthma:</span> a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation; defined by history of symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">bronchiectasis:</span> chronic, irreversible dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles that results from the destruction of muscles and elastic connective tissue; dilated airways become saccular and are a medium for chronic infection</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">chest percussion:</span> manually cupping hands over the chest wall and using vibration to mobilize secretions by mechanically dislodging viscous or adherent secretions in the lungs</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">chest physiotherapy (CPT):</span> therapy used to remove bronchial secretions, improve ventilation, and increase the efficiency of the respiratory muscles; types include postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration, and breathing retraining</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">chronic bronchitis:</span> a disease of the airways defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least a combined total of 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):</span> disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible; sometimes referred to as chronic airway obstruction or chronic obstructive lung disease</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">desaturate:</span> a precipitous drop in the saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">dry-powder inhaler (DPI):</span> a compact, portable inspiratory flow&#x2013;driven inhaler that delivers dry-powder medications into the patient&#x2019;s lungs</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">emphysema:</span> a disease of the airways characterized by destruction of the walls of overdistended alveoli</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">flutter valve:</span> portable handheld mucous clearance device; consisting of a tube with an oscillating steel ball inside; upon expiration, high-frequency oscillations facilitate mucous expectoration</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>):</span> concentration of oxygen delivered (e.g., 1.0 equals to 100% oxygen)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypoxemia:</span> decrease in arterial oxygen tension in the blood</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypoxia:</span> decrease in oxygen supply to the tissues and cells</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">polycythemia:</span> increase in the red blood cell concentration in the blood; in COPD, the body attempts to improve oxygen-carrying capacity by producing increasing amounts of red blood cells</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">postural drainage:</span> positioning the patient to allow drainage from all lobes of the lungs and airways</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI):</span> a compact, portable patient-activated pressurized medication <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page603" title="603"></span>canister that provides aerosolized medication that the patient inhales into the lungs</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">small-volume nebulizer (SVN):</span> a handheld generator-driven medication delivery system that provides aerosolized liquid medication that the patient inhales into the lungs</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">spirometry:</span> pulmonary function tests that measure specific lung volumes (e.g., FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC) and rates (e.g., FEF<sub>25%&#x2013;75%</sub>); may be measured before and after bronchodilator administration</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">vibration:</span> a type of massage given by quickly tapping the chest with the fingertips or alternating the fingers in a rhythmic manner, or by using a mechanical device to assist in mobilizing lung secretions</p>

<p class="nonindent">Chronic pulmonary disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Nurses care for patients with chronic pulmonary disease across the spectrum of care, from outpatient and home care to emergency department (ED), critical care, and hospice settings. To care for these patients, nurses not only need to have astute assessment and clinical management skills, but they also need knowledge of how these disorders can affect quality of life. In addition, the nurse&#x2019;s knowledge of palliative and end-of-life care is important for applicable patients. Patient and family education is an important nursing intervention to enhance self-management in patients with any chronic pulmonary disorder.</p>
