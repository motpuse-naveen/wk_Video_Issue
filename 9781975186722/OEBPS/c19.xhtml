<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">incentive spirometry:</span> method of deep breathing that provides visual feedback to help the patient inhale deeply and slowly and achieve maximum lung inflation</p>

<p class="nonindent">Disorders affecting the chest and lower respiratory tract range from acute to chronic conditions. Many of these disorders are serious and often life-threatening. Patients with chest and lower respiratory tract disorders require care from nurses with astute assessment and clinical management skills as well as knowledge of evidence-based practice. Nurses must also understand the impact of the particular disorder on the patient&#x2019;s quality of life and ability to carry out activities of daily living. Patient and family education is an important nursing intervention in the management of all chest and lower respiratory tract disorders.</p>
