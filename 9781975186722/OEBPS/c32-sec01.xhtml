<h4 class="h4" id="s1277">HIV Infection and AIDS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Since the disease now known as AIDS was first identified in 1981, remarkable progress has been made in improving the length and quality of life for PLWHA. During the first decade, progress was associated with the recognition and treatment, including prophylactic medications, of <strong>opportunistic infections</strong> (illnesses caused by various organisms, some of which usually do not cause disease in people with normal immune systems). The second decade witnessed progress in the development of highly active antiretroviral drug therapies (HAART) as well as continuing progress in the treatment of opportunistic infections. The third decade has focused on issues of preventing new infections, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), development of second-generation combination medications that affect different stages of the viral life cycle, and continued need for an effective vaccine. The HIV antibody test, an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;enzyme immunoassay (EIA):&lt;/b&gt; a blood test that can determine the presence of antibodies to HIV in the blood or saliva; a variant of this test is called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)">enzyme immunoassay</button></strong> (<strong>EIA</strong>; or a variant of this test called <em>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</em> [ELISA]), became available in 1984, allowing early diagnosis of the infection before the onset of symptoms. Since then, HIV infection has been best managed as a chronic disease, most <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1008" title="1008"></span>appropriately in an outpatient care setting, whereas AIDS may involve acute conditions that require hospitalization.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1278">Epidemiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Since the first cases of AIDS were reported in the United States in 1981, surveillance case definitions for HIV infection and AIDS have undergone several revisions (in 1985, 1987, 1993, 2008, and 2014) in response to diagnostic advances. Criteria for a confirmed case of HIV infection can be met by either laboratory evidence or clinical evidence but laboratory evidence, usually obtained through blood tests, is preferred over clinical evidence (e.g., patient signs and symptoms). A case of HIV infection can be classified in one of five HIV infection stages (0, 1, 2, 3, or unknown). Stage 0 indicates early HIV infection, inferred from laboratory testing; stages 1, 2, and 3 are based on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte count; while cases with no information on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte count or percentage are classified as stage unknown (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2322">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014</a>). See <a href="#tt32-2">Table 32-2</a> for further explanation of stages.</p>
<p class="indent">In July 2015, the Obama White House released the <em>National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: Updated to 2020.</em> This document has four Strategic Goals, which include reducing new infections; increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for people living with HIV; reducing HIV-related health disparities and health inequities; and achieving a more coordinated national response to the HIV epidemic. The strategy is being updated by the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy (OHAIDP, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">According to the CDC, 1,006,691 persons aged 13 years and older are living with HIV infection, and an additional 534,515 are living with AIDS in the United States (CDC, 2019a). From 2012 through 2016, the rate of diagnoses of HIV infection decreased, although the annual number of diagnoses remained stable as survival rates have increased. The incidence was 11.8 per 100,000 persons for 2017, with men accounting for 81% of all HIV infection diagnoses (CDC, 2019a). The incidence per 100,000 persons was 41.1 for Blacks/African Americans, followed by 16.1 for Hispanics/Latinos, and 12.6 for persons of multiple races. The highest rate (32.9%) was for persons aged 25 to 29 years, followed by 28.7% for persons aged 20 to 24 years. Male-to-male sexual contact (MSM) (70%, including 3% male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use) and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1009" title="1009"></span>those attributed to heterosexual contact (24%) accounted for approximately 94% of diagnosed HIV infections. Rates within the United States were 16.1% in the South, 10.6% in the Northeast, 9.4% in the West, and 7.4% in the Midwest (CDC, 2019a). Data about infections in transgender persons were not collected.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the World Health Organization ([WHO], 2019), HIV through its morbid consequence of AIDS has claimed more than 32 million lives globally; in 2018, 770,000 people died from HIV-related causes. Globally, there were approximately 37.9 million people living with HIV at the end of 2018, with 1.7 million people becoming newly infected in 2018. The WHO African Region is the most affected region, with 25.7 million people living with HIV in 2018. The African region also accounts for almost two thirds of the global total of new HIV infections. Between 2000 and 2018, new HIV infections fell by 37%, and HIV-related deaths fell by 45% with 13.6 million lives saved due to patients receiving effective medication during that same period. The decrease in infection rates and deaths was the result of many efforts by national HIV programs supported by a range of funding partners (WHO, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1279">HIV Transmission</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Inflammation and breaks in the skin or mucosa result in the increased probability that an HIV exposure will lead to infection. Human immune deficiency virus type 1 (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;HIV-1:&lt;/b&gt; retrovirus isolated and recognized as the etiologic agent of HIV disease">HIV-1</button></strong>) is transmitted in body fluids (blood, seminal fluid, vaginal secretions, amniotic fluid, and breast milk) that contain infected cells. Higher amounts of HIV and infected cells in the body fluid are associated with the probability that the exposure will result in infection. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 may occur in utero, at the time of delivery, or through breast-feeding, but most perinatal infections are thought to occur during labor and delivery. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact (see <a href="#ct32-2">Chart 32-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Blood and blood products can transmit HIV to recipients. However, the risk associated with transfusions has been virtually eliminated as a result of voluntary self-deferral, completion of a detailed health history, extensive testing, heat treatment of clotting factor concentrates, and more effective virus inactivation methods. Donated blood is tested for antibodies to HIV-1, human immune deficiency virus-2 (retrovirus identified in 1986 in patients with AIDS in Western Africa), and the p24 antigen; since 1999, additional testing has been performed.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1280"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">According to the CDC, 91,127 persons between the ages of 60 and 64 years are living with HIV infection, and an additional 58,526 persons are living with AIDS. For persons aged 65 years and older, 82,046 persons are living with HIV infection and an additional 52,995 persons are living with AIDS (CDC, 2019a). Many were diagnosed with HIV in their younger years and are benefitting from effective treatment. However, thousands of older adults unknowingly become infected with HIV every year. Older adults are less likely than younger people to get tested. Thirty-five percent of persons aged 50 and older were diagnosed with late-stage infection or AIDS, indicating a failure to screen for HIV in this population. Although this rate is an improvement from 2011, when it was 42%, it is still high. Late diagnosis has an adverse impact on treatment effectiveness (CDC, 2019b). Medicare will pay for annual screenings up until age 65 but there needs to be a special indication (such as unprotected sex with an infected partner) for a person to be screened after that age in order for Medicare to cover the cost of testing (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Persons are often embarrassed to share that they have engaged in activities associated with HIV infection and so might not disclose this to the health care provider. The provider needs to use other cues, such as the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, and recommend HIV testing. Providers may bring societal age and gender biases to their perceptions of patient sexuality, which influence their communication about sexual health with older adult patients. For some providers, assumptions that discussions about sexual health will offend their patients, as well as their own discomfort with talking to older adults about sex, inhibit them from assessing risk factors that may indicate a need for HIV and STI testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Comorbidities in older persons with HIV/AIDS include type 2 diabetes; non-AIDS cancerous diseases; cardiovascular disease; osteoporosis; and depression (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2338">Guaraldi, Malagoli, Calcagno, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Due to the high number of chronic illnesses, polypharmacy along with drug interactions becomes a major clinical challenge. Loneliness has been defined as the distress that exists between actual and desired relationships and is different from the concept of aloneness or living alone. Loneliness was studied in older persons living with HIV/AIDS by Greene and colleagues, who found that 58% of the participants reported at least some loneliness. Compared to participants who did not report feeling lonely, those who did report loneliness were more likely to smoke, misuse alcohol, or use illicit drugs. They also reported less physical social supports in place, depressive symptoms, poor or fair health-related quality of life, and functional impairment in one or more Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2337">Greene, Hessol, Perissinotto, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Loneliness has been associated with increased mortality in the general population.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1281">Prevention of HIV Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses need to participate in efforts to prevent HIV infection by educating patients how to eliminate or reduce risks associated with HIV infection and AIDS, particularly in younger adults, in order to promote a healthy lifestyle and longevity (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). HIV is transmitted through the exchange of some infected body fluids (see <a href="#ct32-2">Chart 32-2</a>). While behavioral interventions such as encouraging the use of condoms are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1010" title="1010"></span>highly effective in reducing the transmission of HIV, the HIV-negative person must be motivated and have the freedom to choose to use the method. In some situations, however, that freedom is absent. For example, a lack of freedom exists in a discordant couple (those in which only one partner has HIV) if the husband refuses to use condoms and the wife&#x2019;s cultural and religious beliefs require sexual activity with her husband. In this context, <strong>pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)</strong> might be appropriate. PrEP involves taking one pill containing two HIV medications (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg) daily in order to avoid the risk of sexual HIV acquisition in adults and adolescents age 12 and older. HIV status should be checked every 3 months to be sure that the person has not become infected. The ultimate goal of PrEP is to reduce the acquisition of HIV infection with its resulting morbidity, mortality, and cost to individuals and society (CDC, 2019c). For persons taking ART as prescribed and achieving and maintaining viral suppression, there is no risk of transmitting HIV through sex. Since PrEP does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections, which are increasing (CDC, 2019d), it is important for couples to also use a condom.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Preventive Education</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention of HIV infection is achieved through: (a) behavioral interventions have been effective in reducing the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV by ensuring that people have the information, motivation, and skills necessary to reduce their risk; (b) HIV testing, because most people change behaviors to protect their partners if they know they are infected with HIV; and (c) linkage to treatment and care, which enables individuals with HIV to live longer, healthier lives and reduce their risk of transmitting HIV (CDC, 2019e). The CDC (2019f), through the HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis Project, provides information about evidence-based behavioral interventions that can be used in a number of settings with targeted populations. Strategies to protect against infection are outlined in <a href="#ct32-3">Chart 32-3</a>. Other than abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms (see <a href="#ct32-4">Chart 32-4</a>) is the only effective method to decrease the risk <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1011" title="1011"></span>of sexual transmission of HIV infection. When latex male condoms are used consistently and correctly during vaginal or anal intercourse, they are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV. Nonlatex condoms made of natural materials such as lambskin are available for people with latex allergy but will not protect against HIV infection. A male condom should be used for oral contact with the penis, and a dental dam (a flat piece of latex used by dentists to isolate a tooth for treatment) or an altered condom can be used for oral contact with the vagina or rectum. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is 50% to 60% effective at preventing the acquisition of HIV infection. This is a key intervention in generalized epidemic settings with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2334">Ensor, Davies, Rai, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara"><em>Note:</em> Keep condoms cool and dry. Never use skin lotions, baby oil, petroleum jelly, or cold cream as lubricants; the oil in these products will cause the latex condom to break. Products made with water (such as K-Y jelly or glycerin) are safer to use.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The polyurethane female condom, which is an effective contraceptive, provides a physical barrier that prevents exposure to genital secretions containing HIV, such as semen and vaginal fluid, and is inserted by the woman (see <a href="c50.xhtml">Chapter 50</a>). Other safe and effective woman-controlled methods such as microbicides remain elusive although clinical trials continue globally. Microbicides are gels, films, or suppositories that can kill or neutralize viruses and bacteria; vaginal and rectal microbicides are being researched to see if they can prevent sexual transmission of HIV.</p>
<p class="indent">Total abstinence from addictive drugs might not be a realistic short-term goal. The harm reduction framework uses practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with drug use. It is also a movement for social justice built on a belief in, and respect for, the rights of people who use drugs. Using a harm reduction framework, the nurse works with people who inject drugs to assist them to increase their healthy behaviors. Sharing of drug-use equipment is a high-risk behavior for a number of bloodborne infections and should be avoided. Syringe services programs are also referred to as syringe exchange programs and needle exchange programs. Although the services they provide may vary, they are community-based programs that provide access to sterile needles and syringes, facilitate safe disposal of used syringes, and provide and link to other important services and programs (CDC, 2019g). Therefore, under the harm reduction framework, participation in needle exchange programs is encouraged since they do not promote increased drug use; on the contrary, they have been found to decrease the incidence of bloodborne infections in people who inject drugs. Nurses should refer patients to accessible needle exchange programs whenever available.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Related Reproductive Education</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because HIV infection in women often occurs during the childbearing years, family planning issues need to be addressed. Attempts to achieve pregnancy by couples in which only one partner has HIV (known as discordant couples) expose the unaffected partner to the virus. Efforts at artificial insemination using processed semen from an HIV-infected partner continue. Studies are needed, because HIV has been found in the spermatozoa of patients with HIV infection, and it is possible that HIV can replicate in the male germ cell. Women considering pregnancy need to have accurate information about the risks of transmitting HIV infection to themselves, their partner, and their future children, and about the benefits of taking ART to reduce perinatal HIV transmission. Results from the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) Trial Consortium found that, among African women seeking effective contraception and living in areas of high HIV incidence, there was no substantial difference in HIV risk among the methods evaluated (DMPA-IM, a copper IUD, and a levonorgestrel implant) and all methods were safe and highly effective (ECHO Trial Consortium, 2019). HIV-infected women in resource-rich settings should be instructed not to breast-feed their infants, because HIV is transmitted through breast milk.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Prevention in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Persons</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many health care providers are insufficiently prepared to meet the unique health needs of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ). Young gay men, in particular, are at higher risk for contracting HIV (CDC, 2019a). At the same time, these sexual and gender minorities experience significant challenges due to family rejection, lack of social support, stigma, isolation, minority stress, as well as abuse and harassment. Nurses need to be culturally competent in order to be effective in educating these unique populations about prevention methods (see <a href="c54.xhtml">Chapter 54</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1282">Reducing the Risk of Transmission to Health Care Providers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention of HIV and AIDS among health care providers involves the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure, using post-exposure prophylaxis when exposure does occur and hopefully, in the near future, the use of a vaccine.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Standard Precautions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Implementation of appropriate hand hygiene measures (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>, <a href="c66-sec02.xhtml#ct66-1">Chart 66-1</a> for further information on hand hygiene methods) remains the most effective measure to prevent transmission of organisms. To reduce the risk of exposure of health care workers to HIV, the CDC developed standard precautions (see <a href="#ct32-5">Chart 32-5</a>; also see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>, Chart&#x00A0;66-2) which are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens. Standard precautions are used when working with all patients in all health care settings, regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infectious status.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for Health Care Providers</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)</strong> includes taking antiretroviral medicines as soon as possible, but no more than 72 hours (3 days) after possible HIV exposure; three drugs are prescribed. Health care workers who are exposed to a needle stick involving HIV-infected blood in a health care setting have a 0.3% risk of becoming HIV infected; the risk of infection due to occupational exposure is very low (CDC, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Occupational exposure is an urgent medical concern and should be managed immediately after possible exposure&#x2014;the sooner the better; every hour counts (CDC, 2018a). The CDC suggests that these post-exposure guidelines be followed after occupational and other exposures such as sexual assault. <a href="#ct32-6">Chart 32-6</a> provides the strategies and emphasizes the need for quick action. See the Resources section for the phone number for the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) Post-exposure Prophylaxis Hotline which is answered by a health care provider.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Vaccination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the face of a global pandemic, the search for an effective vaccine against the HIV remains an urgent priority. The first U.S. government-sponsored phase I trial of an HIV vaccine was launched in 1987 and intensive efforts worldwide using a variety of strategies continue (NIAID, 2019b).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1283">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because HIV is an infectious disease, it is important to understand how HIV-1 integrates itself into a person&#x2019;s immune system and how the immune response plays a pivotal role in the course of HIV disease. This knowledge is also essential for understanding medication therapy and vaccine development. Viruses are intracellular parasites. HIV is in the subfamily of lentiviruses and is a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;retrovirus:&lt;/b&gt; a virus that carries genetic material in ribonucleic acid (RNA) instead of DNA and contains reverse transcriptase">retrovirus</button></strong> because it carries its genetic material in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Two genetically different but closely related forms of HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) have been identified. Globally, it has been estimated that one to two million individuals have HIV-2, including people with HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infection. The course of illness is slower when infection is caused by HIV-2, which seems to be more common in Western Africa compared to HIV-1, which is more common in other regions of the globe (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Blood tests may be used to screen for both forms of HIV. As shown in <a href="#ff32-1">Figure 32-1</a>, HIV consists of a viral core, containing viral RNA, which is surrounded by an envelope consisting of protruding glycoproteins.</p>
<p class="indent">All viruses target specific cells. HIV targets cells with CD4<sup>+</sup> receptors, which are expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and brain microglia. Mature T cells (T lymphocytes) are composed of two major subpopulations that are defined by cell surface receptors of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup>. Approximately two thirds of peripheral blood T cells are CD4<sup>+</sup>, and approximately one third is CD8<sup>+</sup>. Most people have about 700 to 1000 CD4<sup>+</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, but a level as low as 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> can be considered within normal limits.</p>
<p class="indent">The HIV life cycle is complex. <a href="#ff32-2">Figure 32-2</a> illustrates the seven stages of the life cycle and the various classes of antiretroviral medications that target each specific stage (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2341">HIV Information, 2020</a>; <a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In resting (nondividing) CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, HIV survives in a latent state as an integrated <strong>provirus</strong> that produces few or no viral particles. These resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be stimulated to produce new particles if something activates them, such as another infection. When a resting T cell that harbors this integrated DNA (also known as provirus) becomes activated against HIV or other microbes, the cell begins to produce new copies of both RNA and viral proteins. Consequently, whenever the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cell is activated, HIV replication and budding occur, which can destroy the host cell. Newly formed HIV released into the blood can infect other CD4<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
<p class="indent">HIV-1 mutates quickly, at a relatively constant rate, with about 1% of the virus&#x2019;s genetic material changing annually. HIV-1 exhibits substantial genetic diversity, and several different genotypes of HIV-1 exist throughout the world. There is a major group (group M), which consists of subtypes A through L, and a more diverse collection of outliers, which has been referred to as groups N and O. Subtype B HIV-1 viruses predominate in the Western world; this genetic variation is one of the major reasons why effective vaccine development has been such a challenge.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1284">Stages of HIV Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are five stages of HIV infection based on clinical history, physical examination, laboratory evidence (CDC, 2014), signs and symptoms, and associated infections and malignancies. See <a href="#tt32-2">Table 32-2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The period from infection with HIV to the development of HIV-specific antibodies is known as <strong>primary infection or acute HIV infection</strong> (previously known as the window period) and is part of stage 0 (CDC, 2014). Acute HIV infection is the interval between the appearance of detectable HIV RNA and the first detection of antibodies. Initially, persons test negative on the HIV antibody blood test, although they are not only infected, but also highly contagious because their viral loads are very high. About 40% to 80% of patients develop clinical symptoms of a nonspecific viral illness (e.g., fever, fatigue, or rash) lasting 1 to 2 weeks. After 2 to 3 weeks, antibodies to the glycoproteins of the HIV envelope can be detected in the sera of people infected with HIV, but most of these antibodies lack the ability to totally control the virus. By the time neutralizing antibodies can be detected, HIV-1 is firmly established in the host.</p>
<p class="indent">Primary or acute infection is characterized by high levels of viral replication, widespread dissemination of HIV throughout the body, and destruction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which leads to dramatic drops in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts (normally 500 to 1500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> of blood). The host responds to the HIV infection through a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response that causes other immune cells, such as CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, to increase their killing of infected, virus-producing cells. The body produces antibody molecules in an effort to contain the free HIV particles (outside cells) and assist in their removal. During this stage, the virus is widely disseminated in lymphoid tissue, and a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;latent reservoir:&lt;/b&gt; the integrated HIV provirus within the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell during the resting memory state; does not express viral proteins and is invisible to the immune system and antiviral medications">latent reservoir</button></strong> within resting memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is created.</p>
<p class="indent">During stage 1, the amount of virus in the body after the initial immune response subsides results in a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;viral set point:&lt;/b&gt; amount of virus present in the blood after the initial burst of viremia and the immune response that follows">viral set point</button></strong> which reflects an equilibrium between HIV levels and the immune response. Untreated, this set point can last for years and is inversely correlated with disease prognosis. The higher the viral set point, the poorer the prognosis. After the viral set point is reached, a chronic stage persists in which the immune system cannot eliminate the virus despite its best efforts. This set point varies greatly from patient to patient and dictates the subsequent rate of disease progression; on average, 8 to 10 years can pass before a major HIV-related complication develops. In this prolonged, chronic stage (stage 1), patients feel well and have few, if any, symptoms, which is why this stage had been referred to as asymptomatic. Apparent good health continues because CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell levels remain high enough to preserve immune defensive responses, but, over time, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decrease.</p>

Adapted from HIV Information, 2020.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Stage 2 occurs when CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte cells decrease to between 200 and 499 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and had previously been referred to as the symptomatic stage. Stage 3 is diagnosed when the count drops below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and the person has AIDS. HIV disease progression is classified from less to more severe; once a case is classified into a surveillance severity stage, it cannot be reclassified into a less severe stage even if the CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes increase, which often occurs when a person receives ART. A stage 3, AIDS, diagnosis has implications for services (e.g., disability benefits, housing, and food stamps), because these programs are often linked to living with severe immune dysfunction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1285">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings in HIV Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the first stage of HIV infection, the patient may have no symptoms or generalized signs and symptoms such as fatigue or skin rash. Patients who are in later stages of HIV infection may have a variety of symptoms related to their immunosuppressed state. The staging system requires laboratory evidence of HIV infection in order to diagnose HIV or AIDS (see <a href="#tt32-2">Table 32-2</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1014</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1015" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1015">p. 1015</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">HIV Tests</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several tests are used to diagnose HIV infection, and others are used to determine the stage and severity of the infection. A serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion (STARHS) analyzes HIV-positive blood samples to determine whether an HIV infection is recent or has been ongoing. There are three types of HIV diagnostic tests: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid (RNA) tests. Antibody tests detect antibodies, not HIV itself, while antigen and RNA tests directly detect HIV. The CDC recommends tests for HIV antigens and HIV nucleic acid because studies from high-risk populations found that antibody testing alone might miss a considerable percentage of HIV infections detectable by virologic tests, especially during stage 0.</p>
<p class="indent">Blood tests can detect HIV infection sooner after exposure compared to oral fluid tests because the level of antibody in blood is higher than it is in oral fluid. Likewise, antigen/antibody and RNA tests detect infection in blood before antibody tests. Some newer antigen/antibody laboratory tests can sometimes find HIV as soon as 3 weeks after exposure to the virus.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Follow-up testing</strong> is performed if the initial test result is positive to ensure a correct diagnosis. These tests include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>antibody <em>differentiation tests,</em> which distinguishes HIV-1 from antibodies</span></li>
<li><span><em>HIV-1 nucleic acid tests,</em> which looks for the virus RNA directly</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Table 32-3 identifies common blood tests used for screening.</p>
<p class="indent">Since negative perceptions and judgments associated with being HIV infected continue to persist, stigma remains one of the biggest social challenges (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2336">Glynn, Llabre, Lee, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). When the result of the HIV antibody test is received, it is carefully explained to the patient in private (see <a href="#ct32-7">Chart 32-7</a>). All test results are confidential. Education and counseling about the test result and about preventing transmission are essential. The patient&#x2019;s psychological response to a positive test result may include feelings of panic, depression, and hopelessness. The social and interpersonal consequences of a positive test result can be devastating. The patient may lose their sexual partner, housing, and their job because of disclosure. They may be subjected to physical abuse and, although illegal, experience discrimination in employment as well as social ostracism. For these reasons and others, patients who test positive may need ongoing counseling as well as referrals for social, financial, medical, and psychological support services. The HIV Care Continuum (CDC, 2019h) starts when patients receive their positive HIV blood test results. They must be connected to health care services to evaluate their stage of HIV infection and start treatment.</p>

<p class="indent">Patients whose test results are seronegative may develop a false sense of security, possibly resulting in continued high-risk behaviors or feelings that they are immune to the virus. These patients may need ongoing counseling to help modify high-risk behaviors and to encourage returns for repeated testing. Other patients may experience anxiety regarding the uncertainty of their status. In addition to screening for HIV, patients should be screened for other bloodborne coinfections such as hepatitis; other STIs such as syphilis; and other infections associated with T-cell immunity such as tuberculosis (TB). The rates of coinfection of hepatitis C and HIV are approximately 25% (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2352">Starbird, Hong, Sulkowski, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Staging</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Two surrogate markers are used routinely to assess immune function and level of HIV viremia: CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count (CD4<sup>+</sup> count) and plasma HIV RNA (viral load). CD4<sup>+</sup> count should be measured in all patients at entry into care. <strong>Viral load tests</strong> use target amplification methods to quantify HIV RNA or DNA levels in the plasma. Target amplification methods include reverse transcriptase&#x2013;<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;polymerase chain reaction (PCR):&lt;/b&gt; a sensitive laboratory technique that can detect and quantify HIV in a person&#x2019;s blood or lymph nodes">polymerase chain reaction</button></strong> (RT-PCR) and nucleic acid sequence&#x2013;based amplification <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1016" title="1016"></span>(NAT). A widely used viral load test measures plasma HIV RNA levels. Currently, these tests are used to track viral load and response to treatment of HIV infection. RT-PCR is also used to detect HIV in high-risk seronegative people before antibodies are measurable, to confirm a positive EIA result, and to screen neonates. HIV culture or quantitative plasma culture and plasma viremia are additional tests that measure viral burden, but they are used infrequently. Viral load is a better predictor of the risk of HIV disease progression than the CD4<sup>+</sup> count. The lower the viral load, the longer the time to AIDS diagnosis and the longer the survival time.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1286">Treatment of HIV Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (Panel) (2019) is composed of HIV specialists from across the country who regularly meet to review the latest scientific evidence. The CD4<sup>+</sup> count serves as the major laboratory indicator of immune function and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, and is the strongest predictor of subsequent disease progression and survival (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). New drugs offer strategies based on the interaction between the life cycle of HIV and the host response, improvements in potency and activity even against multidrug-resistant viruses, dosing convenience, and tolerability. Goals of ART treatment include: (1) reduce HIV-associated morbidity and prolong the duration and quality of survival, (2) restore and preserve immunologic function, (3) maximally and durably suppress plasma HIV viral load, and (4) prevent HIV transmission (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). HIV suppression with ART may also decrease inflammation and immune activation thought to contribute to higher rates of cardiovascular and other end-organ damage. ART is recommended for all HIV-infected patients regardless of their viral load or CD4<sup>+</sup> count (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Optimal viral suppression is defined generally as a viral load persistently below the level of detection (HIV RNA less than 20 to 75 copies/mL, depending on the assay used). Providers, in partnership with patients, make treatment decisions based on a number of factors, including whether the patient has already taken ART or is ART-naive and the willingness of the patient to adhere to the lifelong treatment regimen.</p>
<p class="indent">Achieving viral suppression requires the use of combination ART regimens that generally include three active drugs from two or more drug classes (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Viral load suppression to below limits of assay detection usually occurs within the first 12 to 24 weeks of taking ART. Predictors of virologic reduction include: (1) low baseline viremia; (2) high potency of the ART regimen; (3) tolerability of the regimen; (4) convenience of the regimen; and (5) excellent adherence to the regimen.</p>
<p class="indent">More than 30 antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in seven classes are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x2013;approved for treatment of HIV infection. These seven classes target different stages of the HIV/host interaction. Examples include the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (stage 3), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (stage 3), protease inhibitors (PIs) (stage 7), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) (stage 4), a fusion inhibitor (stage 2), a CCR5 antagonist (stage 1), and a CD4<sup>+</sup> post-attachment inhibitor (stage 1) (see <a href="#ff32-2">Fig. 32-2</a>). In addition, some drugs are used as pharmacokinetic enhancers (or boosters) to improve the effectiveness of other ARV drugs (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). The Panel (2019) provides clear directions regarding which medications should be prescribed for both ART-naive and experienced patients.</p>
<p class="indent">The CDC estimates that HIV has not yet been diagnosed in about 13% of the people living with HIV in the United States. After receiving an HIV diagnosis, about 75% of individuals are linked to care within 30 days, but only 57% of persons who receive an HIV diagnosis are retained in HIV care. It is estimated that only 55% of persons with diagnosed HIV are virally suppressed because of poor linkage to care and retention in care (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Viral loads are often not suppressed because the patient is not adhering to the treatment plan. Psychosocial barriers such as depression and other mental illnesses, neurocognitive impairment, low health literacy, low levels of social support, stressful life events, high levels of alcohol consumption and active substance use, homelessness, poverty, nondisclosure of HIV serostatus, denial, stigma, and inconsistent access to medications affect adherence to ART. Failure to adopt practices that facilitate adherence, such as linking medication taking to daily activities or using a medication reminder system or a pill organizer, is also associated with treatment failure (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Simplifying treatment regimens and decreasing the number of medications that must be taken each day also helps to increase patients&#x2019; adherence to therapy. Although antiretroviral regimens have become less complex, side effects create barriers to adherence and inadequate dosing can lead to viral resistance. It is difficult to predict patients&#x2019; adherence to medication regimens, but a positive relationship between the patient and health care provider is associated with better adherence (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2340">Hill, Golin, Pack, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Chart 32-8 summarizes strategies that health care providers can encourage to promote treatment regimen adherence. Many real-time monitoring systems, such as electronic pill boxes, are under investigation as well as pharmacologic monitoring of blood and hair (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2340">Hill et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Real-time monitoring has the potential to enhance ART intervention programs by providing objective information about medication taking behaviors. Every health care encounter should be used as an opportunity to briefly review the treatment regimen, identify any new issues, and reinforce successful behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory tests evaluate whether ART is effective for a specific patient. An adequate CD4<sup>+</sup> response for most patients on ART is an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> count in the range of 50 to 150 mm<sup>3</sup> per year, generally with an accelerated response in the first 3 months (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Viral load should be measured at baseline and on a regular basis thereafter because viral load is the most important indicator of response to ART.</p>
<p class="indent">Adverse effects associated with all HIV treatment regimens include hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and osteopenia, along with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction (see <a href="#tt32-4">Table 32-4</a>). Many of the antiretroviral agents may cause fat redistribution syndrome and metabolic alterations such as dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, which put the patient at risk for early-onset heart disease and diabetes. The fat redistribution syndrome (lipodystrophy) consists of lipoatrophy (localized subcutaneous fat loss in the face, arms, legs, and buttocks) and lipohypertrophy (central visceral fat [lipomata] accumulation in the abdomen, although possibly in the breasts, dorsocervical region [buffalo hump], and within the muscle and liver). Facial wasting, characterized as a sinking of the cheeks, eyes, and temples caused by the loss of fat tissue under the skin, may be treated by injectable fillers such as poly-l-lactic acid (see <a href="#ff32-3">Fig. 32-3</a>). These changes can disturb the body image of people living with HIV/AIDS and may be a reason that they decline or stop ART.</p>

<h6 class="h6">ART Drug Resistance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Drug resistance is the ability of pathogens to withstand the effects of medications that should be toxic to them. There <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1021" title="1021"></span>are two major components of ART resistance: (1) transmission of drug-resistant HIV at the time of initial infection and (2) selective drug resistance in patients who are receiving nonsuppressive regimens. Genotypic and phenotypic resistance assays are used to assess viral strains and inform selection of treatment strategies. Genotypic assays detect drug-resistant mutations present in relevant viral genes while phenotypic assays measure the ability of a virus to grow in different concentrations of ART drugs. Resistance testing in persons who are chronically infected is recommended at the time of entry into HIV care. Although no definitive prospective data exist to support the choice of one type of resistance testing over another, genotypic testing is generally preferred because of lower cost, more rapid turnaround time, the assay&#x2019;s ability to detect mixtures of wild-type and resistant virus, and the relative ease of interpreting test results. If therapy is deferred, repeat testing soon before initiation of ART should be considered because the patient may have acquired drug-resistant virus (i.e., superinfection) (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS):&lt;/b&gt; a syndrome that results from rapid restoration of pathogen-specific immune responses to opportunistic infections">Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome</button></strong> (<strong>IRIS</strong>) results from rapid restoration of organism-specific immune responses to infections that cause either the deterioration of a treated infection or new presentation of a subclinical infection. This syndrome typically occurs during the initial months after beginning ART and is associated with a wide spectrum of organisms, most commonly mycobacteria, herpes viruses, and deep fungal infections. IRIS is characterized by fever, respiratory and/or abdominal symptoms, and worsening of the clinical manifestations of an opportunistic infection or the appearance of new manifestations. IRIS is treated with anti-inflammatory medications such as cortisone. The nurse should be alert to the possibility of IRIS, especially in the 3-month period after treatment with ART is initiated, because this syndrome is associated with significant morbidity and patients often require hospital admission.</p>
<p class="indent">Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is a serious complication that arises during successful ART in patients with HIV-TB co-infection who are receiving TB treatment. In the majority of patients, TB-IRIS occurs within the first few weeks of ART but can occur much later. Patients with HIV-TB co-infection with low CD4<sup>+</sup> counts who start ART are at high risk of developing TB-IRIS. Although the immunopathogenesis of TB-IRIS is still not completely understood, the explosive restoration of T-cell function is believed to play a distinct role (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2345">Narendran, Oliveira-de-Souza, Vinhaes, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1287">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with HIV/AIDS experience a number of symptoms related to the disease, side effects of treatment, and other comorbidities, including pancreatitis, hepatitis, and cardiometabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HIV/AIDS are widespread and may involve virtually any organ system. Patients in stage 3 or AIDS (see <a href="#tt32-2">Table 32-2</a>) are severely immune depressed and can develop opportunistic infections. Nurses need to understand the causes, signs and symptoms, and interventions, including self-management strategies that can enhance the quality of life for patients throughout the different stages of the illness. Symptom assessment tools can be used to assess patients&#x2019; symptom intensity and severity. PLWHA use a variety of self-management strategies to minimize common symptoms.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Respiratory Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Shortness of breath, dyspnea (labored breathing), cough, chest pain, and fever are associated with various opportunistic infections, such as those caused by <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare,</em> cytomegalovirus (CMV), and <em>Legionella</em> species.</p>
<p class="h7">Pneumocystis Pneumonia</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Pneumocystis</em></strong> <strong>pneumonia (PCP)</strong> is caused by <em>P. jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2349">Panel on Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV [OI-Panel], 2019</a>) and is associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte (CD4<sup>+</sup>) cell counts less than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The most common manifestations of PCP are subacute onset of progressive dyspnea, fever, nonproductive cough, and chest discomfort that worsens within days to weeks. In mild cases, pulmonary examination usually is normal at rest. With exertion, tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse dry (cellophane) rales may be auscultated. Fever is apparent in most cases and may be the predominant symptom. Hypoxemia is the most characteristic laboratory abnormality, along with elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Because clinical presentation, blood tests, and chest X-rays are not pathognomonic for PCP, and because the organism cannot be cultivated routinely, histopathologic or cytopathologic demonstration of organisms in tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or induced sputum samples is required for a definitive diagnosis (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Mycobacterium Avium Complex</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Mycobacterium avium</em></strong> <strong>complex (MAC)</strong> disease is a common opportunistic infection that typically occurs in patients with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte (CD4<sup>+</sup>) cell counts less than 50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. MAC is caused by infection with different types of mycobacterium: <em>Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare,</em> or <em>Mycobacterium kansasii.</em> Early symptoms may be minimal and can precede detectable mycobacteremia <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1022" title="1022"></span>by several weeks and include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. A confirmed diagnosis of disseminated MAC disease is based on compatible clinical signs and symptoms coupled with the isolation of MAC from cultures of blood, lymph node, bone marrow, or other normally sterile tissue or body fluids (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Tuberculosis</p>
<p class="nonindent">The estimated annual risk of reactivation with TB among those with untreated HIV infection and latent TB infection is 3% to 16% and approximates the lifetime risk for individuals without HIV infection who have latent TB infection. TB disease can occur at any CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte (CD4<sup>+</sup> cell) count, although the risk increases with progressive immune deficiency. Testing for latent TB at the time of HIV diagnosis should be routine, regardless of an individual&#x2019;s risk of TB exposure. Individuals with negative diagnostic tests for latent TB who have stage 3 HIV infection should be retested once their CD4<sup>+</sup> count increases due to ART. Screening for symptoms (asking for cough of <em>any</em> duration) coupled with chest radiography is recommended to exclude TB disease in a patient with a positive skin test or interferon-gamma release assays. Latent TB in a person with HIV infection is treated with isoniazid, supplemented with pyridoxine to prevent peripheral neuropathy, for 9 months since it has proven efficacy, good tolerability, and infrequent severe toxicity (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">TB disease can develop in the lungs as well as in extrapulmonary sites such as the central nervous system (CNS), bone, pericardium, stomach, peritoneum, and scrotum and initial diagnostic testing is directed at the anatomic site of symptoms or signs, such as the lungs, lymph nodes, and cerebrospinal fluid. TB in individuals with advanced immune deficiency can be rapidly progressive and fatal if treatment is delayed and such patients often have smear-negative sputum specimens. Therefore, after collection of available specimens for culture and molecular diagnostic tests, empiric treatment for TB is warranted in patients with clinical and radiographic presentation suggestive of HIV-related TB. Treatment of suspected TB in individuals with HIV infection is the same as for those who are HIV uninfected and should include an initial four-drug combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The gastrointestinal manifestations of HIV infection and AIDS include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, oral and esophageal candidiasis, and chronic diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be related to the direct inflammatory effect of HIV on the cells lining the intestines. Some of the enteric pathogens that occur most frequently, identified by stool cultures or intestinal biopsy, are <em>Cryptosporidium muris, Salmonella</em> species, <em>Isospora belli, Giardia lamblia,</em> cytomegalovirus (CMV), <em>Clostridium difficile,</em> and <em>M. avium-intracellulare.</em> In patients with AIDS, the effects of diarrhea can be devastating in terms of profound weight loss (more than 10% of body weight), fluid and electrolyte imbalances, perianal skin excoriation, weakness, and inability to perform the usual activities of daily living.</p>
<p class="h7">Candidiasis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oropharyngeal and esophageal <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;candidiasis:&lt;/b&gt; fungal infection, usually of skin or mucous membranes, caused by Candida species">candidiasis</button></strong> (fungal infections) are common in patients with HIV infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaquelike lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, oropharyngeal mucosa, or tongue surface. Lesions can be easily scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument which is in contrast to lesions associated with oral hairy leukoplakia. In women with early-stage HIV infection, <em>Candida</em> vulvovaginitis usually presents the same as in women without HIV infection, with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity and sporadic recurrences (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">HIV Wasting Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;wasting syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary weight loss consisting of both lean and fat body mass">Wasting syndrome</button></strong> is the involuntary loss of more than 10% of one&#x2019;s body weight while having experienced diarrhea or weakness and fever for more than 30 days. Wasting refers to the loss of muscle mass, although part of the weight loss may also be due to loss of fat.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Oncologic Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Those with HIV/AIDS are at greater risk of developing certain cancers. These include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Kaposi sarcoma:&lt;/b&gt; malignancy that involves the epithelial layer of blood and lymphatic vessels">Kaposi sarcoma</button></strong> (KS), lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer. KS and lymphomas are discussed next. Cervical carcinoma is described later in the Gynecologic Manifestations section.</p>
<p class="h7">Kaposi Sarcoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">KS is caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8); affects eight times more men than women; and may spread through sexual contact. It involves the epithelial layer of blood and lymphatic vessels. AIDS-related KS exhibits a variable and aggressive course, ranging from localized cutaneous lesions to disseminated disease involving multiple organ systems. Cutaneous signs may be the first manifestation of HIV; they can appear anywhere on the body and are usually brownish pink to deep purple. They may be flat or raised and surrounded by ecchymosis (hemorrhagic patches) and edema (see <a href="#ff32-4">Fig. 32-4</a>). Rapid development of lesions involving large areas of skin is associated with extensive disfigurement and significant body image issues. The location and size of some lesions can lead <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1023" title="1023"></span>to venous stasis, lymphedema, and pain. Ulcerative lesions disrupt skin integrity and increase discomfort and susceptibility to infection. The most common sites of visceral involvement are the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Involvement of internal organs may eventually lead to organ failure, hemorrhage, infection, and death.</p>

<p class="indent">Diagnosis of KS is confirmed by biopsy of suspected lesions. Prognosis depends on the extent of the tumor, the presence of other symptoms of HIV infection, and the CD4<sup>+</sup> count. Death may result from tumor progression, but more often it results from other complications of HIV infection.</p>
<p class="h7">AIDS-Related Lymphomas</p>
<p class="nonindent">AIDS-related lymphomas include both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. AIDS-related lymphoma is usually aggressive; there are three main types: diffuse large B-cell; B-cell immunoblastic; and small noncleaved cell lymphoma. Symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, and fever. The complete blood count might be abnormal and a biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neurologic Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">HIV-related brain changes have profound effects on cognition, including motor function, executive function, attention, visual memory, and visuospatial function. Neurologic dysfunction results from direct effects of HIV on nervous system tissue, opportunistic infections, primary or metastatic neoplasm, cerebrovascular changes, metabolic encephalopathies, or complications secondary to therapy. Immune system response to HIV infection in the CNS includes inflammation, atrophy, demyelination, degeneration, and necrosis.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Approximately 20% of those living with HIV infection are at risk for developing a subcortical neurodegenerative disease known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2333">Cummins, Waters, Aggar, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The signs of HAND can be subtle and include changes in language, memory, problem solving and slowing of psychomotor skills (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2333">Cummins et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Early identification is important as HAND can be treated by changing ART medications.</p>
<p class="h7">Peripheral Neuropathy</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;peripheral neuropathy:&lt;/b&gt; disorder characterized by sensory loss, pain, muscle weakness, and wasting of muscles in the hands or legs and feet">Peripheral neuropathy</button></strong> is a common neurologic symptom at any stage of HIV infection. It may be a side effect of some ART drugs, and may occur in a variety of patterns, with distal sensory polyneuropathy or distal symmetric polyneuropathy the most frequently occurring type. It can lead to significant pain of feet and hands and functional impairment. Patients use a variety of physical and psychological self-management strategies to minimize this symptom.</p>
<p class="h7">HIV Encephalopathy</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;HIV encephalopathy:&lt;/b&gt; clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive, behavioral, and motor functions">HIV encephalopathy</button></strong> was formerly referred to as AIDS dementia complex (see <a href="#ct32-9">Chart 32-9</a>). It is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive, behavioral, and motor functions as a direct result of HIV infection. HIV has been found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with HIV encephalopathy. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1024" title="1024"></span>brain cells infected by HIV are predominantly the CD4<sup>+</sup> cells of monocyte&#x2013;macrophage lineage. HIV infection is thought to trigger the release of toxins or lymphokines that result in cellular dysfunction, inflammation, or interference with neurotransmitter function rather than cellular damage.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms may be subtle and difficult to distinguish from fatigue, depression, or the adverse effects of treatment for infections and malignancies. Early manifestations include memory deficits, headache, difficulty concentrating, progressive confusion, psychomotor slowing, apathy, and ataxia. Later stages include global cognitive impairments, delay in verbal responses, a vacant stare, spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, psychosis, hallucinations, tremor, incontinence, seizures, mutism, and death.</p>
<p class="indent">Confirming the diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy can be difficult. Extensive neurologic evaluation includes a computed tomography scan, which may indicate diffuse cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Other tests that may detect abnormalities include magnetic resonance imaging, analysis of CSF through lumbar puncture, and brain biopsy.</p>
<p class="h7">Cryptococcus Neoformans</p>
<p class="nonindent">A fungal infection <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em> is another common opportunistic infection among patients with AIDS, and it causes neurologic disease. Cryptococcal meningitis is characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, malaise, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, and seizures. Diagnosis is confirmed by CSF analysis.</p>
<p class="h7">Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy:&lt;/b&gt; opportunistic infection that infects brain tissue and causes damage to the brain and spinal cord">Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</button></strong> (PML) is a demyelinating CNS disorder that affects the oligodendroglia. Clinical manifestations often begin with mental confusion and rapidly progress to include blindness, aphasia, muscle weakness, paresis (partial or complete paralysis), and death. ART has greatly reduced the mortality associated with this disorder.</p>
<p class="h7">Other Neurologic Disorders</p>
<p class="nonindent">Other infections involving the nervous system include <em>Toxoplasma gondii,</em> CMV, and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infections.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Depressive Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Depression and apathy are neuropsychiatric complications of HIV infection. Estimates suggest that the prevalence of current depression is between 12% and 60% in persons with HIV/AIDS (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2343">Lu, Hsiao, Sheng, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Similarly, apathy, which refers to reduced, self-initiated, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral activity, is also commonly reported among those living with a diagnosis of HIV. Alcohol and cocaine use&#x2014;both current and former&#x2014;have been associated with depression and apathy in this population, and depression has been associated with less adherence with ART medications (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2343">Lu et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Integumentary Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cutaneous manifestations are associated with HIV infection and the accompanying opportunistic infections and malignancies. KS (described earlier) and opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster and herpes simplex are associated with painful vesicles that disrupt skin integrity. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection characterized by deforming plaque formation. Seborrheic dermatitis is associated with an indurated, diffuse, scaly rash involving the scalp and face. Patients with AIDS may also exhibit a generalized folliculitis associated with dry, flaking skin or atopic dermatitis, such as eczema or psoriasis. Many patients treated with the antibacterial agent trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole develop a drug-related rash that is pruritic with pinkish-red macules and papules (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2371">Panel, 2019</a>). Patients with any of these rashes experience discomfort, have body image changes, and are at increased risk for infection from disrupted skin integrity.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gynecologic Manifestations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Persistent, recurrent vaginal candidiasis may be the first sign of HIV infection in women. Past or present genital ulcers are a risk factor for the transmission of HIV infection. Women with HIV infection are more susceptible to genital ulcers and venereal warts and have increased rates of incidence and recurrence of these conditions. Ulcerative STIs such as chancroid, syphilis, and herpes are more severe in women with HIV infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes venereal warts and is a risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, a cellular change that is frequently a precursor to cervical cancer. Women who are HIV seropositive and have cervical carcinoma present at a more advanced stage of disease and have more persistent and recurrent disease and a shorter interval to recurrence and death than women without HIV infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Women with HIV are at increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, a reportable infection, and the associated inflammation may increase HIV transmission to the uninfected sexual partner. Moreover, women with HIV infection appear to have a higher incidence of menstrual abnormalities, including amenorrhea or bleeding between periods, than do women without HIV infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1288">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Treatment of Opportunistic Infections and Coinfection with Hepatitis C</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Guidelines for the treatment of opportunistic infections should be consulted for the most current recommendations (OI-Panel, 2019). Although ART is highly effective in keeping the CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count high, opportunistic infections continue to cause considerable morbidity and mortality for three main reasons: (1) many patients are unaware of their HIV infection and present with an opportunistic infection as the initial indicator of their disease, (2) some patients are aware of their HIV infection but do not take antiretroviral agents because of psychosocial or economic factors, and (3) others receive prescriptions for antiretroviral medications but fail to attain adequate virologic and immunologic response as a result of issues related to adherence, pharmacokinetics, or unexplained biologic factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Coinfection with hepatitis C requires careful medical management for the PLWHA. Hepatitis C is curable with an 8- to 12-week drug therapy in most patients. However, the medications for the treatment of hepatitis C interact with many ART medications and therefore need to be carefully <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1025" title="1025"></span>managed to avoid interactions and maximize adherence (OI-Panel, 2019; <a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2352">Starbird et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Pneumocystis Pneumonia <img class="m" src="images/watch.jpg" alt="icon" /></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfcb89f8e1f3" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Caring for a Patient With HIV/AIDS-Related Pneumocystis Pneumonia</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Persons in stage 3 HIV infection should receive chemoprophylaxis to prevent PCP with trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole if they have CD4<sup>+</sup> counts less than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OI-Panel, 2019). Once the CD4<sup>+</sup> count improves, prophylaxis can be discontinued. When a person is diagnosed with PCP, trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice, lowering the dose if there is abnormal renal function. Adjunctive corticosteroids are indicated as early as possible, preferentially within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy. Treatment duration is usually 21 days; rates of adverse reaction to trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole are high including rash (30% to 55%) (including Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome), fever (30% to 40%), leukopenia (30% to 40%), hepatitis (20%), thrombocytopenia (15%), azotemia (1% to 5%), and hyperkalemia. Because long-term survival is possible for patients in whom ART is effective, individuals with AIDS and severe PCP should be given the option to choose mechanical ventilation and critical care management if their functional status is such that it would be appropriate, just as with patients without HIV infection. Paradoxical IRIS has been reported following PCP and starting ART (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Mycobacterium Avium Complex</p>
<p class="nonindent">Initial treatment of MAC disease should consist of two or more antimycobacterial drugs to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance. Clarithromycin is the preferred first agent; however, azithromycin can be substituted for clarithromycin when drug interactions or intolerance to clarithromycin preclude its use. Ethambutol is the recommended second drug (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Cryptococcal Meningitis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cryptococcosis among patients with HIV infection most commonly occurs as a subacute meningitis or meningoencephalitis with fever, malaise, and headache. Treating cryptococcosis consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy. The preferred induction treatment for cryptococcal meningitis and other forms of extrapulmonary cryptococcosis is the IV lipid formulation of amphotericin B in combination with fluconazole. Serious potential adverse effects of amphotericin B include anaphylaxis, kidney and hepatic impairment, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, fever, and severe chills. After at least 2 weeks of successful induction therapy&#x2014;defined as substantial clinical improvement and a negative CSF culture after repeat lumbar puncture&#x2014;amphotericin B and flucytosine can be discontinued. Follow-up or consolidation therapy is then initiated with oral fluconazole daily which should continue for at least 8 weeks (OI-Panel, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Cytomegalovirus Retinitis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Retinitis caused by CMV is a leading cause of blindness in patients with AIDS. Oral valganciclovir, IV ganciclovir, IV ganciclovir followed by oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, IV cidofovir, and a ganciclovir intraocular implant coupled with valganciclovir are all effective treatments for CMV retinitis (OI-Panel, 2019). All of these drugs have significant toxicities (bone marrow suppression, neutropenia, hepatitis, renal toxicity, seizures, etc.) and are used with caution.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antidiarrheal Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although many forms of diarrhea respond to treatment, it is not unusual for this condition to recur and become a chronic problem for the patient with HIV infection. Therapy with octreotide acetate, a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, has been shown to effectively manage chronic severe diarrhea. High concentrations of somatostatin receptors have been found in the gastrointestinal tract and in other tissues. Somatostatin inhibits many physiologic functions, including gastrointestinal motility and intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chemotherapy</h6>
<p class="h7">Kaposi Sarcoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">KS can be treated with local therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy depending upon the location of the lesions.</p>
<p class="h7">Lymphoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">There is no standard treatment for AIDS-related peripheral or systemic lymphoma. The treatment plan is adjusted for each patient and usually includes one or more of combination chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antidepressant Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment for depression in people with HIV infection involves cognitive behavioral therapy integrated with pharmacotherapy (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2343">Lu et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). If depressive symptoms are severe and of sufficient duration, treatment with antidepressants may be initiated. Antidepressants such as imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine may be used, because these medications also alleviate the fatigue and lethargy that are associated with depression. A psychostimulant such as methylphenidate may be used in low doses in patients with neuropsychiatric impairment. Electroconvulsive therapy may be an option for patients with severe depression who do not respond to pharmacologic interventions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutrition Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Alterations in lipid metabolism are associated with HIV infection and ART. Malnutrition increases the risk of infection and the incidence of opportunistic infections. Nutrition therapy should be part of the overall management plan and should be tailored to meet the nutritional needs of the patient, whether by oral diet, enteral tube feedings, or parenteral nutritional support, if needed. As with all patients, a healthy diet is essential for the patient with HIV infection. For all patients with AIDS who experience unexplained weight loss, calorie counts and weight monitoring should be obtained to evaluate nutritional status and initiate appropriate therapy. The goal is to maintain the ideal weight and, when necessary, to increase weight.</p>
<p class="indent">Appetite stimulants have been successfully used in patients with AIDS-related anorexia. Megestrol acetate, a synthetic oral progesterone preparation, promotes significant weight gain and inhibits cytokine IL-1 synthesis. In patients with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1026" title="1026"></span>HIV infection, it increases body weight primarily by increasing body fat stores. Dronabinol, which is a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in marijuana, has been used to relieve nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. After beginning dronabinol therapy, almost all patients with HIV infection experience a modest weight gain. The effects on body composition are unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">Oral supplements may be used when the diet is deficient in calories and protein. Ideally, oral supplements should be lactose free (people with HIV infection may be intolerant to lactose), high in calories and easily digestible protein, low in fat with the fat easily digestible, palatable, inexpensive, and tolerated without causing diarrhea. Nutritional supplements have been developed specifically for people with HIV infection and AIDS. Parenteral nutrition is the final option because of its prohibitive cost and associated risks, including possible infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1289">Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Health Therapies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">People with HIV infection, along with many Americans, report the use of complementary, alternative, and integrative therapies. Combined with traditional therapies, these may improve the patient&#x2019;s overall well-being. However, there can be adverse drug&#x2013;drug interactions between certain therapies (e.g., St. John&#x2019;s wort) and some ART.</p>
<p class="indent">Although there is insufficient research on the effects of complementary, alternative, and integrative therapies, a growing body of literature reports benefits for modalities involving nutrition, exercise, psychosocial treatment, and Chinese medicine. See <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for further information on complementary, alternative, and integrative therapies.</p>
<p class="indent">Many patients who use these therapies do not report their use to their health care providers. To obtain a complete health history, the nurse should ask about the patient&#x2019;s use of complementary, alternative, and integrative therapies. Patients may need to be encouraged to report their use of these therapies to their primary provider. Problems may arise, for example, when patients are using complementary, alternative, and integrative therapies while participating in clinical drug trials; alternative therapies can have significant adverse side effects, making it difficult to assess the effects of the medications in the clinical trial. The nurse needs to become familiar with the potential adverse side effects of these therapies; if it is suspected that the therapy is causing side effects, the nurse needs to discuss this with the patient, the alternative therapy provider, and the primary provider. The nurse needs to view complementary, alternative, and integrative therapies with an open mind and try to understand the importance of this treatment to the patient. This approach will improve communication with the patient and reduce conflict.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1290">Supportive Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who are weak and debilitated as a result of chronic illness associated with HIV infection and AIDS typically require many kinds of supportive care. Nutritional support may be as simple as providing assistance in obtaining or preparing meals. For patients with more advanced nutritional impairment resulting from decreased intake, wasting syndrome, or gastrointestinal malabsorption associated with diarrhea, parenteral feedings may be required. Imbalances that result from nausea, vomiting, and profuse diarrhea often necessitate IV fluid and electrolyte replacement.</p>
<p class="indent">Management of skin breakdown associated with KS, perianal skin excoriation, or immobility entails thorough and meticulous skin care that involves regular turning, cleansing, and applications of medicated ointments and dressings. To combat pain associated with skin breakdown, abdominal cramping, peripheral neuropathy, or KS, the nurse administers analgesic agents at regular intervals around the clock. Patients with a history of drug abuse will need to have tailored approaches for pain management. Relaxation and guided imagery may help reduce pain and anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">Pulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea and shortness of breath, may be related to opportunistic infections, KS, or fatigue. For patients with these symptoms, oxygen therapy, relaxation training, and energy conservation techniques may be effective. Patients with severe respiratory dysfunction may require mechanical ventilation. Before mechanical ventilation is instituted, the procedure is explained to the patient and the caregiver.</p>
<p class="indent">As noted previously, with the advent of ART, there are generally more positive outcomes than could be achieved years ago, and a patient mechanically ventilated has a reasonable likelihood of survival. However, if the patient decides to forego mechanical ventilation, those wishes must be followed. Ideally, the patient has prepared an advance directive identifying preferences for treatments and end-of-life care, including hospice care. If the patient has not identified preferences in advance, treatment options are described so that the patient can make informed decisions and have those wishes respected.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses should anticipate that patients as well as family and friends will need support and time to share concerns. In some family systems, more than one person might be living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

In addition, the patient&#x2019;s ability to purchase, prepare, and store food safely is assessed. Weight history (i.e., changes over time), anthropometric measurements, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum protein, albumin, and transferrin levels provide objective measurements of nutritional status.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The patient&#x2019;s level of knowledge about HIV infection, modes of disease transmission, and adherence to ART are evaluated. In addition, the level of knowledge of family (biologic and family of choice) and friends is assessed. The patient&#x2019;s psychological reaction to the diagnosis of HIV infection is important to explore. Reactions vary among patients and may include denial, anger, fear, shame, withdrawal from social interactions, and depressive symptoms (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2343">Lu et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> N<small>UTRITIONAL</small> S<small>TATUS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nutritional status is assessed by monitoring weight; dietary intake; and serum albumin, BUN, protein, and transferrin levels. The patient is also assessed for factors that interfere with oral intake, such as anorexia and lactose intolerance. Based on the results of assessment, the nurse can implement specific measures to facilitate oral intake. The dietitian is consulted to determine the patient&#x2019;s nutritional requirements.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is encouraged to eat foods that are easy to swallow and to avoid spicy or sticky food items and foods that are excessively hot or cold. Oral hygiene before and after meals is encouraged. The patient who is underweight is instructed about ways to enhance the nutritional value of meals. Adding eggs, butter, or fortified milk (milk to which powdered skim milk has been added to increase the caloric content) to gravies, soups, or milkshakes can provide additional calories and protein. High-calorie, nutritional foods such as puddings, powders, milkshakes, and nutritional supplements may also be useful.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>D<small>ECREASING THE</small> S<small>ENSE OF</small> I<small>SOLATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">People with HIV are at risk for double stigmatization. They have what society refers to as a &#x201C;dreaded disease,&#x201D; and they may have a lifestyle that differs from what is considered acceptable by many people. The diagnosis might prompt disclosure about hidden lifestyles or behaviors to family, friends, coworkers, and health care providers. As a result, people with HIV infection may be overwhelmed with emotions such as anxiety, guilt, shame, and fear. They also may be faced with multiple losses, such as loss of financial security, normal roles and functions, self-esteem, privacy, ability to control bodily functions, ability to interact meaningfully with the environment, and sexual functioning as well as rejection by sexual partners, family, and friends. Some patients may harbor feelings of guilt because of their lifestyle or because they may have infected others in current or previous relationships. Other patients may feel anger toward sexual partners who transmitted the virus to them. Infection control measures used in the hospital or at home may further contribute to the patient&#x2019;s emotional isolation. Any or all of these stressors may cause the patient to withdraw both physically and emotionally from social contact.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nurses are in a key position to provide an atmosphere of acceptance and understanding for people with HIV infection and their social networks. The patient&#x2019;s usual level of social interaction is assessed as early as possible to provide a baseline for monitoring changes in behaviors that suggest social isolation (e.g., decreased interaction with staff or family, hostility, nonadherence). Patients are encouraged to express feelings of isolation and loneliness, with the assurance that these feelings are not unique or abnormal.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Providing information about how to protect themselves and others may help patients avoid social isolation. Patients, family, and friends must be reassured that HIV is not spread through casual contact. Education of ancillary personnel, nurses, and physicians helps reduce factors that might contribute to patients&#x2019; feelings of isolation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OPING WITH</small> G<small>RIEF</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse can help the patient verbalize feelings and explore and identify resources for support and mechanisms for coping, especially when the patient is grieving anticipated losses. The patient is encouraged to maintain contact with family, friends, and coworkers and to use local or national support groups and hotlines. If possible, losses are identified and addressed. The patient is encouraged to continue usual activities whenever possible. Consultations with mental health counselors are useful for many patients and their families.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> K<small>NOWLEDGE OF</small> H<small>IV</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient and family are educated about HIV infection, means of preventing HIV transmission, ART, and appropriate self-care measures. Information about the purpose of the medications, their correct administration, side effects, and strategies to manage or prevent side effects is provided.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="yellow">Side Effects of Medications.</span> Adverse effects are of concern in patients who receive numerous medications for HIV infection. Many medications can cause severe toxic effects. Patients and their caregivers need to know which signs and symptoms of side/toxic effects should be reported immediately to their primary care provider (see <a href="#tt32-4">Table 32-4</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to medications used to treat HIV infection, other medications that may be required include opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and NSAIDs for pain relief; medications for treatment of opportunistic and coinfections; antihistamines (diphenhydramine for relief of pruritus; acetaminophen or aspirin for management of fever; and antiemetic agents for control of nausea and vomiting). Concurrent use of these medications can cause many drug interactions, resulting in hepatic and hematologic abnormalities. Therefore, careful monitoring of laboratory test results is essential.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During each contact with the patient, the nurse not only asks about side effects, but also about how well the patient is adhering to the medication regimen. To promote adherence, the nurse should assist the patient to organize and plan the medication schedule. Individualized adherence plans should consider housing and social support issues, in addition to health indicators including possible drug&#x2013;drug interactions. Self-reported adherence measures can distinguish clinically meaningful patterns of medication-taking behaviors; therefore, nurses should assess if patients can describe how they are taking their ART.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Research suggests that the development of effective self-management strategies leads to increased ART adherence (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2351">Schreiner, Perazzo, Currie, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>), PLWHA at risk for high treatment burden and subsequent nonadherence are those with multiple comorbidities and low social support (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2351">Schreiner et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct32-11">Chart 32-11</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="yellow">Monitoring for HAND.</span> Each contact with the patient is also an opportunity to assess for the presence of HAND. A baseline assessment and then an annual assessment for signs and symptoms are recommended (<a href="c32-sec02.xhtml#bib2333">Cummins et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Nurses also need to educate caregivers about signs and symptoms of this subtle disorder.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="yellow">Body Image Changes.</span> Body image changes often occur in patients with HIV and are an important collaborative problem. The nurse helps the patient verbalize feelings and explore and identify resources for support and mechanisms for coping with body image changes. Consultations with mental health counselors may be indicated for patients adjusting to body image changes.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Schreiner, N., Perazzo, J., Currie, J., et&#x00A0;al. (2019). A descriptive, cross-sectional study examining treatment burden in people living with HIV. <em>Applied Nursing Research</em>, <em>46</em>, 31&#x2013;36.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Successful HIV treatment associated with advances in ART has resulted in HIV being classified as a chronic condition. The purposes of this study were to: (1) describe persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) experiencing high levels of treatment burden who are at high risk for self-management nonadherence, and (2) test the relationship between known antecedent correlates (the number of chronic conditions, social capital, and age) of self-management and treatment burden in community dwelling sample of PLWHA while controlling for socio-demographics. As an indicator of social support, the relationship between social capital and treatment burden was tested.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional secondary analysis of a larger, multi-site study that examined physical activity patterns of PLWHA. Participants were &#x2265;18 years of age and had confirmed HIV (HIV+ ELISA with confirmatory PCR or Western blot). An additional inclusion criterion was diagnosis of two or more chronic conditions identified in the patient&#x2019;s medical record. The Treatment Burden Questionnaire-13 (TBQ-13) was used to measure participant treatment burden. The TBQ-13 is a psychometrically tested instrument containing 13 items inquiring about burden associated with self-management tasks such as medication administration, self-monitoring of chronic conditions, or changes in diet. The TQB-13 asks the respondent to rank the level of burden for each question with responses ranging from 0-No Burden, to 10-Very High Burden, with summed scores ranging from 0 to 130 (higher scores indicating greater treatment burden). The Social Capital Measurement Tool was used to measure social resources.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants were on average 50 years of age; most were African American, male, Medicaid insured, and had a high school diploma. There was a mean of 3.63 (SD = 1.76) chronic conditions and the mean treatment burden score was 22.84 (SD = 24.57). Based on established cut-off points for low, medium, and high treatment burden, the sample experienced low levels of treatment burden, though there was wide variation in treatment burden scores. Approximately 60 PLWHA (58%) reported low treatment burden, 27 (26%) moderate treatment burden, and 16 (16%) high treatment burden. The number of comorbidities was positively associated with treatment burden, and social resources were negatively correlated with treatment burden.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses need to be aware that there are potential benefits of treatment burden screening that may help to improve self-management adherence. These results can help inform nurses how to improve the self-management adherence in PLWHA who are affected by treatment burden in the clinical setting.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patients, families, and friends are educated about the routes of transmission of HIV. The nurse discusses precautions the patient can use to avoid transmitting HIV sexually (see Charts 32-2 and 32-3) or through sharing of body fluids, especially blood. Patients and their families or caregivers must receive instructions about how to prevent disease transmission, including hand hygiene techniques and methods for safely handling and disposing of items soiled with body fluids. Clear guidelines about avoiding and controlling infection, keeping regular health care appointments, symptom management, nutrition, rest, and exercise are necessary (see <a href="#ct32-12">Chart 32-12</a>). The importance of personal and environmental hygiene is emphasized. Caregivers are taught hand hygiene and appropriate infection prevention precautions (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>, Charts 66-1 and 66-2). Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be cleaned regularly with disinfectants to prevent growth of fungi and bacteria. Patients with pets are encouraged to have another person clean areas soiled by animals, such as birdcages and litter boxes. If this is not possible, patients should use gloves to clean the area and then wash their hands afterward. Patients are advised to avoid exposure to others who are sick or who have been recently vaccinated, especially with live vaccine. The importance of avoiding smoking, excessive alcohol, and over-the-counter and street drugs is emphasized. Patients who are HIV positive or who inject drugs are instructed not to donate blood. IV/injection drug users who are unwilling to stop using drugs are advised to avoid sharing drug equipment with others.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Caregivers in the home are taught how to administer medications. The medication regimens used for patients with HIV infection can be complex and expensive. Patients receiving combination therapies for the treatment of HIV infection require careful education about the importance of taking medications as prescribed and explanations and assistance in fitting the medication regimen into their lives (see <a href="#ct32-8">Chart 32-8</a>). If the patient requires enteral or parenteral nutrition, instruction is provided to the patient and family about how to administer nutritional therapies at home. Nurses provide ongoing education and support for the patient and family.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Many people with HIV remain in their community and continue their usual daily activities, whereas others can no longer work or maintain their independence. Families or caregivers may need assistance in providing supportive care. Many community-based organizations provide a variety of services for people living with HIV infection; nurses can help identify these services.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Home, community-based, transitional, and hospice nurses are in an excellent position to provide the support and guidance that is so often needed in the home setting. Home health nurses are key to the safe and effective administration of parenteral antibiotics, chemotherapy, and nutrition in the home.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional status and home environment. The patient&#x2019;s adherence to the therapeutic regimen is assessed, and strategies are suggested to assist with adherence. The patient is assessed for progression of disease and for adverse side effects of medications. Previous education is reinforced, and the importance of keeping follow-up appointments is stressed.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Complex wound care or respiratory care may be required in the home. Patients and families are often unable to meet these skilled care needs without assistance. Nurses may refer patients to community programs that offer a range of services for patients, friends, and families, including help with housekeeping, hygiene, and meals; transportation and shopping; individual and group therapy; support for caregivers; telephone networks for the homebound; and legal and financial assistance. These services are typically provided by both professionals and nonprofessional volunteers. A social worker may be consulted to identify sources of financial support, if needed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Home health and hospice nurses are increasingly called on to provide physical and emotional support to patients and families as patients with AIDS enter the terminal stages of disease. This support takes on special meaning when people with AIDS lose friends and when family members fear the disease or feel anger concerning the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle. The nurse encourages the patient and family to discuss end-of-life decisions and to ensure that care is consistent with those decisions, all comfort measures are employed, and the patient is treated with dignity at all times.</p>
