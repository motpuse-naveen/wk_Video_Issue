<h4 class="h4" id="s2558">Peyronie Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Peyronie disease is an acquired, benign condition that involves the buildup of fibrous plaques in the sheath of the corpus cavernosum. These plaques are not visible when the penis is relaxed. However, when the penis is erect, curvature occurs that can be painful and can make penile-vaginal intercourse difficult or impossible. Peyronie disease typically begins between 45 and 65 years of age. Medical management in the first year of active disease includes systemic, topical, intralesional, or extracorporeal techniques, with 50% of men experiencing spontaneous resolution. Surgical removal of mature plaques is used to treat severe disease. Patients should be fully informed of available treatment options and their likely outcomes (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Martins, Kulkarni, &#x0026; Kohler, 2020</a>).</p>
