<p class="nonindent">Nurses care for patients with breast disorders in many settings. To care for these patients effectively, nurses require an understanding of the assessment, diagnostic testing, nursing management, and rehabilitation needs of patients with multiple processes that affect the breasts. A breast disorder, whether benign or malignant, can cause great anxiety and fear of potential disfigurement, loss of sexual attractiveness, and even death. Nurses, therefore, must have expertise in the assessment and management of not only the physical symptoms but also the psychosocial symptoms associated with various breast disorders.</p>
