<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;asthma:&lt;/b&gt; a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation; defined by history of symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity">Asthma</button></strong> is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA], 2019a). This chronic inflammatory disease of the airways causes airway hyperresponsiveness, mucosal edema, and mucus production. This inflammation ultimately leads to recurrent episodes of asthma symptoms: cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and dyspnea (<a href="#ff20-10">Fig.&#x00A0;20-10</a>). In the United States, asthma affects approximately 19 million adults and accounted for approximately 3564 deaths in 2017 (CDC, 2017b; Kochanek, Murphy, Xu, et&#x00A0;al., 2019). Of these adults, 35.2% have intermittent severity and 64.8% have persistent severity of asthma symptoms (CDC, 2015). Nearly 10% of all ED visits are related to asthma (CDC, 2018c). Although <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page633" title="633"></span>asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, it can occur at any age. For most patients, asthma is a disruptive disease, affecting school and work attendance, occupational choices, physical activity, and general quality of life.</p>

<p class="indent">Twenty-one percent of patients with asthma smoke, even though cigarette smoke is known to trigger an attack, while nearly 17% of people without asthma smoke (CDC, 2015). Asthma&#x2013;COPD overlap refers to patients who have clinical presentations of both conditions (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1608">Papi, Brightling, Pedersen, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Smokers are at higher risk for having asthma&#x2013;COPD overlap (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1608">Papi et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Despite increased knowledge regarding the pathology of asthma and the development of improved medications and management plans, the death rate from the disease continues to rise. Ethnic and racial disparities affect morbidity and mortality in asthma, particularly for African American and Hispanic/Latino American urban populations (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1616">Sullivan, Ghushchyan, Kavati, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Contributing to these disparities are epidemiologic considerations and risk factors that include genetic and molecular aspects; inner-city environments; limited community assets; health care access/delivery/and quality; and insufficient health insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike other obstructive lung diseases, asthma is largely reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment. Patients with asthma may experience symptom-free periods alternating with acute exacerbations that last from minutes to hours or days.</p>
<p class="indent">Allergy is the strongest predisposing factor for asthma. Chronic exposure to airway irritants or allergens also increases the risk of asthma. Common allergens can be seasonal (e.g., grass, tree, weed pollens) or perennial (e.g., mold, dust, roaches, animal dander). Common triggers for asthma symptoms and exacerbations include airway irritants (e.g., air pollutants, cold, heat, weather changes, strong odors or perfumes, smoke, occupational exposure), foods (e.g., shellfish, nuts), exercise, stress, hormonal factors, medications, viral respiratory tract infections, and gastroesophageal reflux. Most people who have asthma are sensitive to a variety of triggers.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s766">Pathophysiology <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></h5>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be86a9800290" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Asthma</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The underlying pathology in asthma is reversible diffuse airway inflammation that leads to long-term airway narrowing. This narrowing, which is exacerbated by various changes in the airway, includes bronchoconstriction, airway edema, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1608">Papi et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The interaction of these factors determines the clinical manifestations and severity of asthma (GINA, 2019a). Over the course of a lifetime, the impact of increasing pathophysiologic changes and environmental susceptibility lead to an irreversible disease process.</p>
<p class="indent">Asthma is a complex disease process that involves numerous inflammatory and structural cells as well as mediators that lead to the disorder&#x2019;s effects. Mast cells, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils all play a key role in the inflammation of asthma. When activated, mast cells release several chemicals called <em>mediators.</em> These chemicals, which include histamine, bradykinin, prostanoids, cytokines, leukotrienes, and other mediators, perpetuate the inflammatory response, causing increased blood flow, vasoconstriction, fluid leak from the vasculature, attraction of white blood cells to the area, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1566">Kacmarek et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1635">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During acute exacerbations of asthma, bronchial smooth muscle contraction or bronchoconstriction occurs quickly to narrow the airway in response to an exposure. Acute bronchoconstriction due to allergens results from an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent release of mediators from mast cells; these mediators include histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins that directly contract the airway. In addition, alpha- and beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system located in the bronchi play a role. When the alpha-adrenergic receptors are stimulated, bronchoconstriction occurs. The balance between alpha- and beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic receptors is controlled primarily by cyclic 3&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic stimulation results in increased levels of cyclic AMP, which inhibits the release of chemical mediators and causes bronchodilation.</p>
<p class="indent">As asthma becomes more persistent, the inflammation progresses and other factors may be involved in airflow limitation. These include airway edema, mucus hypersecretion, and the formation of mucus plugs. In addition, airway &#x201C;remodeling&#x201D; (i.e., structural changes) may occur in response to chronic inflammation, causing further airway narrowing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s767">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The three most common symptoms of asthma are cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. In some instances, cough may be the only symptom. An asthma attack often occurs at night or early in the morning, possibly because of circadian variations that influence airway receptor thresholds.</p>
<p class="indent">An asthma exacerbation may begin abruptly but most frequently is preceded by increasing symptoms over the previous few days. There is cough, with or without mucus production. At times, the mucus is so tightly wedged in the narrowed airway that the patient cannot cough it up. There may be generalized wheezing (the sound of airflow through narrowed airways), first on expiration and then possibly during inspiration as well. Generalized chest tightness and dyspnea occur. Expiration requires effort and becomes prolonged. As the exacerbation progresses, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and a widened pulse pressure may occur along with hypoxemia and central cyanosis (a late sign of poor oxygenation). Severe, life-threatening hypoxemia can occur in asthma but is relatively uncommon. The hypoxemia is secondary to a ventilation&#x2013;perfusion mismatch and readily responds to supplemental oxygenation.</p>
<p class="indent">Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma include maximal symptoms during exercise, absence of nocturnal symptoms, and sometimes only a description of a &#x201C;choking&#x201D; sensation during exercise.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s768">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">To establish the diagnosis, the clinician must determine that episodic symptoms of airflow obstruction are present, airflow is at least partially reversible, and other causes have been excluded. A positive family history and environmental factors, including seasonal changes, high pollen counts, mold, pet dander, climate changes (particularly cold air), and air pollution, are primarily associated with asthma. In addition, asthma is associated with a variety of foods, compounds, and occupation-related chemicals. Comorbid conditions that may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page634" title="634"></span>accompany asthma include viral infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease, drug-induced asthma, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Other possible allergic reactions that may accompany asthma include eczema, rashes, and temporary edema. Questions in the assessment that may help to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s asthma control include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Have your symptoms awakened you at night or in the early morning?</span></li>
<li><span>Have you needed your quick-acting relief medication more than usual?</span></li>
<li><span>Have you needed unscheduled care for your asthma&#x2014;a call to the primary provider&#x2019;s office, office visit, ED?</span></li>
<li><span>Have your symptoms impacted your normal activities at school/work/sports?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">During acute episodes, sputum and blood tests may disclose eosinophilia (elevated levels of eosinophils). Serum levels of IgE may be elevated if allergy is present. Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry reveal hypoxemia during acute attacks. Initially, hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis are present. As the patient&#x2019;s condition worsens and they become more fatigued, the PaCO<sub>2</sub> may increase. Because carbon dioxide is 20 times more diffusible than oxygen, it is rare for PaCO<sub>2</sub> to be normal or elevated in a person who is breathing very rapidly.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> during an asthma attack may be a signal of impending respiratory failure.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">During an exacerbation, the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC are markedly decreased but improve with bronchodilator administration (demonstrating reversibility). Pulmonary function is usually normal between exacerbations. The occurrence of a severe, continuous reaction is referred to as status asthmaticus and is considered life-threatening (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Asthma severity is considered in the selection of the initial type, amount, and schedule of treatments (GINA, 2019a). Disease severity is classified by current impairment and future risk of adverse events. Impairment is defined by the following factors: nighttime awakenings, the need for short-acting bronchodilators for symptom relief, work/school days missed, ability to engage in normal activities, and quality of life. Lung function is evaluated by spirometry. Assessment of risk of future adverse events is evaluated by numbers of exacerbations, the need for ED care or hospitalizations in the past year, demographic data (gender, ethnicity, nonuse of prescribed ICS therapy, existing smoking), psychosocial factors and attitudes, and beliefs about taking medication (GINA, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s769">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with recurrent asthma should undergo testing to identify the substances that precipitate the symptoms. Possible causes are dust, dust mites, roaches, certain types of cloth, pets, horses, detergents, soaps, certain foods, molds, and pollens. If the attacks are seasonal, pollens can be strongly suspected. Patients are instructed to avoid the causative agents whenever possible. Knowledge is the key to quality asthma care. Evaluation of impairment and risk are primary methods that help ensure control.</p>
<p class="indent">Occupational asthma refers to asthma induced by exposure in the work environment to dusts, vapors, or fumes, with or without a preexisting diagnosis of asthma. An estimated 5% to 20% of new asthma cases in the United States are related to workplace exposures (GINA, 2019a). Work-related asthma should be part of the differential diagnosis of every case of adult-onset asthma. A detailed work history evaluation is key to identifying occupational asthma. Immediate treatment is aimed at removing or decreasing the exposure in the patient&#x2019;s environment and following the patient on an ongoing basis. Standard asthma medications may be prescribed to minimize bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. In certain cases, patients may be impaired or disabled from the disease. Compensation systems are in place to protect a worker; however, these systems are often slow and complex to navigate.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s770">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of asthma may include status asthmaticus, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and atelectasis. Airway obstruction, particularly during acute asthmatic episodes, often results in hypoxemia, requiring the administration of oxygen and the monitoring of pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases. Fluids are given because people with asthma are frequently dehydrated from diaphoresis and insensible fluid loss with hyperventilation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s771">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary treatment focuses on preventing impairment of lung function, minimizing symptoms, and preventing exacerbations (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1608">Papi et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). GINA (2019a) recommendations are based on the concept of severity and control of asthma along with the domains of reducing impairment and reducing risk as keys to improving care. Asthma control is assessed by symptom management and future risk of adverse outcomes (GOLD, 2019). In an acute situation, symptom control includes using immediate intervention to diminish bronchoconstriction, which prevents increased anxiety resulting from progressive dyspnea. Uncontrolled anxiety could aggravate the situation and ultimately worsen dyspnea. Poor symptom control increases the risk of exacerbations (GINA, 2019a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are two general classes of asthma medications: quick-relief medications for immediate treatment of asthma symptoms and exacerbations and long-acting medications to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma (<a href="#tt20-5">Tables 20-5</a> and <a href="#tt20-6">20-6</a>). Because the underlying pathology of asthma is inflammation, control of persistent asthma is accomplished primarily with regular use of anti-inflammatory medications. The route of choice for administration of these medications is a pMDI or other type of inhaler, because it allows for localized administration within the lungs (see <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#ct20-6">Chart&#x00A0;20-6</a> and <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#tt20-3">Table&#x00A0;20-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Quick-Relief Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Short-acting beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic agonists</em> (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol, pirbuterol) are the medications of choice for relief of acute symptoms and prevention of exercise-induced asthma. They are used to relax smooth muscle.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Anticholinergics</em> (e.g., ipratropium) inhibit muscarinic cholinergic receptors and reduce intrinsic vagal tone of the airway. These may be used in patients who do not tolerate short-acting beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic agonists.</p>

<p class="indent">The combination medication ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate is used for quick relief of asthma symptoms and acute exacerbations. This medication is administered using a small-volume nebulizer (SVN; discussed previously).</p>
<p class="h7">Long-Acting Control Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Corticosteroids</em> are the most potent and effective anti-inflammatory medications currently available. They are broadly effective in alleviating symptoms, improving airway function, and decreasing peak flow variability. Initially, an inhaled form is used. All patients should rinse their mouth with water (and should not swallow the rinse) after administration of ICSs to prevent thrush, a common complication associated with the use of these drugs. However, those who lack the coordination to ensure proper administration technique should use a spacer. This will reduce medication deposition within the mouth and further reduce the risk of thrush. A systemic preparation may be used to gain rapid control of the disease; to manage severe, persistent asthma; to treat moderate to severe exacerbations; to accelerate recovery; and to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists</em> (LABAs) are used with anti-inflammatory medications to control asthma symptoms, particularly those that occur during the night. These agents are also effective in the prevention of exercise-induced asthma. LABAs are not indicated for immediate relief of symptoms. Salmeterol and formoterol have duration of bronchodilation of at least 12 hours. They are used with other medications in long-term control of asthma.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Leukotriene modifiers (inhibitors),</em> or <em>antileukotrienes,</em> are a class of medications that include montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton. Leukotrienes, which are synthesized from membrane phospholipids through a cascade of enzymes, are potent bronchoconstrictors that also dilate blood vessels and alter permeability. Leukotriene inhibitors act either by interfering with leukotriene synthesis or by blocking the receptors where leukotrienes exert their action. They may provide an alternative to ICSs for mild persistent asthma, or they may be added to a regimen of ICSs in more severe asthma to attain further control.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Phosphodiesterase inhibitors</em> cause bronchodilation and act as mild anti-inflammatory agents by influencing epinephrine release. Theophylline is used as an add-on agent and in conjunction with inhaled steroids; however, it is not as effective in treating asthma as the medications previously discussed. Theophylline should be used with reservation because it has the potential to cause many drug interactions and its higher risk of side effects (GOLD, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Immunomodulators</em> prevent binding of IgE to the high-affinity receptors of basophils and mast cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved five biologic immunomodulators for the treatment of asthma (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab) and several others are in development. Medications in this class are add-on treatments used when patients experience poor symptom control on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids with a LABA (ICS-LABA). These immunomodulators are monoclonal antibodies that are derived from biologic sources and are therefore sometimes referred to as biologics. They help with symptom control by interfering with the inflammatory response that is associated with acute asthmatic episodes (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1605">Krings, McGregor, Bacharier, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Cost and patient preference for route of administration must be considered when adding on this treatment (GOLD, 2019). Biologics are either administered subcutaneously or intravenously.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Management of Exacerbations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Asthma exacerbations are best managed by early treatment and education, including the use of written action plans as part of any overall effort to educate patients about self-management techniques, especially those with moderate or severe persistent asthma or with a history of severe exacerbations (GINA, 2019a). GINA (2019a) recommends using an ICS treatment for the prevention of exacerbations in adults. Short-acting beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic agonist medications are used at the time of the exacerbation for prompt relief of airflow obstruction. Systemic corticosteroids may be necessary to decrease airway inflammation in patients who fail to respond to inhaled beta-adrenergic medications. In some patients, oxygen supplementation may be required to relieve hypoxemia associated with moderate to severe exacerbations. In addition, response to treatment may be monitored by serial measurements of lung function. Patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations may benefit from routinely using ICS-LABA to improve symptom management and prevent the occurrence of exacerbations.</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence from clinical trials suggests that antibiotic therapy, whether given routinely or when suspicion of bacterial infection is low, is not beneficial for asthma exacerbations (GINA, 2019a). Antibiotics may be appropriate in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients who have symptoms of a respiratory infection (e.g., fever and purulent sputum, evidence of pneumonia, suspected bacterial sinusitis).</p>
<p class="indent">Despite insufficient data supporting or refuting the benefits of using a written asthma action plan as compared to medical management alone, it is recommended to use a written asthma action plan to educate patients about self-management (<a href="#ff20-11">Fig.&#x00A0;20-11</a>). Plans can be based on either symptoms or peak flow measurements. They should focus on daily management as well as the recognition and handling of worsening symptoms. Patient self-management and early recognition of problems lead to more efficient communication with health care providers about asthma exacerbations (GINA, 2019a).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Peak Flow Monitoring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Peak flow meters measure the highest airflow during a forced expiration (<a href="#ff20-12">Fig.&#x00A0;20-12</a>). Daily peak flow monitoring is recommended for patients who meet one or more of the following criteria: have moderate or severe persistent asthma, have poor perception of changes in airflow or worsening symptoms, have unexplained response to environmental or occupational exposures, or at the discretion of the clinician and patient (GINA, 2019a). Peak flow monitoring helps measure asthma severity and, when added to symptom monitoring, indicates the current degree of asthma control.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is instructed in the proper technique (<a href="#ct20-8">Chart&#x00A0;20-8</a>), particularly about using maximal effort; peak flows are monitored for 2 or 3 weeks after receipt of optimal asthma therapy. Then, the patient&#x2019;s &#x201C;personal best&#x201D; value is measured. The green (80% to 100% of personal best), yellow (60% to 80%), and red (less than 60%) zones are determined, and specific actions are delineated for each zone, enabling the patient to monitor and manipulate their own therapy after careful instruction (GINA, 2019a).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">GINA (2019a) recommends that peak flow monitoring be considered an adjunct to asthma management for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma. Peak flow monitoring plans may enhance communication between the patient and health care providers and may increase the patient&#x2019;s awareness of disease status and control.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s772">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The immediate nursing care of patients with asthma depends on the severity of symptoms. The patient may be treated successfully as an outpatient if asthma symptoms are relatively mild or may require hospitalization and intensive care if symptoms are acute and severe. The patient and family are often frightened and anxious because of the patient&#x2019;s dyspnea. Therefore, a calm approach is an important aspect of care. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status by monitoring the severity of symptoms, breath sounds, peak flow, pulse oximetry, and vital signs.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse generally performs the following interventions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Obtains a history of allergic reactions to medications before administering medications.</span></li>
<li><span>Identifies medications the patient is taking.</span></li>
<li><span>Administers medications as prescribed and monitors the patient&#x2019;s responses to those medications. These medications may include an antibiotic if the patient has an underlying respiratory infection.</span></li>
<li><span>Administers fluids if the patient is dehydrated.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">If the patient requires intubation because of acute respiratory failure, the nurse assists with the intubation procedure, continues close monitoring of the patient, and keeps the patient and family informed about procedures. (See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for discussion of intubation and mechanical ventilation.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Implementation of basic asthma management principles at the community level is a major challenge. Strategies include education of health care providers, establishment of programs for asthma education (for patients and providers), the use of outpatient follow-up care for patients, and a focus on chronic management versus acute episodic care. Nurses are pivotal to achievement of these objectives.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education is a critical component of care for patients with asthma. Multiple inhalers, different types of inhalers, antiallergy therapy, antireflux medications, and avoidance measures are essential for long-term control. This complex therapy requires a partnership between the patient and the health care providers to determine the desired outcomes and to formulate a plan to achieve those outcomes. The patient then carries out daily therapy as part of self-care management, with input and guidance by their health care providers. Before a partnership can be established, the patient must understand the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Nature of asthma as a chronic inflammatory disease</span></li>
<li><span>Definitions of inflammation and bronchoconstriction</span></li>
<li><span>Purpose and action of each medication</span></li>
<li><span>Triggers to avoid and how to avoid them</span></li>
<li><span>Proper inhalation technique</span></li>

<p class="indent">An assortment of excellent educational materials is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and other sources (see Resources section at the end of the chapter). The nurse should obtain current educational materials for the patient based on the patient&#x2019;s diagnosis, causative factors, educational level, and cultural background. If a patient has a coexisting sensory impairment (i.e., vision loss or hearing impairment), materials should be provided in an alternative format.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Nurses who have contact with patients with asthma in any setting use the opportunity to assess the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status and ability to manage self-care to prevent serious exacerbations. Nurses emphasize adherence to the prescribed therapy, preventive measures, and the need to keep follow-up appointments with health care providers. Home visits to assess the home environment for allergens may be indicated for patients with recurrent exacerbations. Nurses refer patients to community support groups. In addition, nurses <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page642" title="642"></span>remind patients and families about the importance of health promotion strategies and recommended health screening.</p>

<p class="box5text"><span class="unfold"><strong>Jennifer Hoffman</strong></span> is a 33-year-old woman diagnosed with asthma in childhood. She has come to the clinic multiple times over the last 2 mo complaining of continued symptoms. Her asthma action plan was adjusted by her primary provider last month. What measures can the nurse take to determine areas needing education reinforcement? How can the nurse ensure that Jennifer is accurately following the prescribed asthma regimen and monitoring medication effectiveness? (Jennifer Hoffman&#x2019;s story continues in <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>.)</p>
