<p class="nonindent">Acute hepatic failure or <strong>acute liver failure</strong> (ALF) is the clinical syndrome of sudden and severely impaired liver function in a person who was previously healthy. The definition of ALF includes neurologic dysfunction, an elevated prothrombin time and international normalized ratio&#x00A0;(PT/INR) &#x2265;1.5, no prior evidence of liver disease, and a disease course of &#x2264;26&#x00A0;weeks (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Maher &#x0026; Schreibman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Montrief, Koyfman, &#x0026; Long, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). The time from the onset of symptoms such as jaundice to the development of hepatic encephalopathy categorizes the different forms of acute liver failure: a very rapid injury (within hours) is referred to as hyperacute liver failure; and a slower, immune-based injury (days to weeks) is considered acute or subacute (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Maher &#x0026; Schreibman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Stravitz &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>). In hyperacute liver failure, the duration of jaundice before the onset of encephalopathy is 0 to 7 days; in acute liver failure, it is 8 to 28 days; and in subacute liver failure, it is 28 to 72&#x00A0;days. The prognosis for acute hepatic failure is much worse than for chronic liver failure. However, in acute failure, the hepatic lesion is potentially reversible, and survival rates are approximately 20% to 50%, depending greatly on the cause. Those who do not survive die of massive hepatocellular injury and necrosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Maher &#x0026; Schreibman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Montrief et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Stravitz &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Viral hepatitis is a common cause of ALF; other causes include toxic medications (e.g., acetaminophen) and chemicals (e.g., carbon tetrachloride), metabolic disturbances (e.g., Wilson disease, a hereditary syndrome with deposition of copper in the liver), and structural changes (e.g., Budd&#x2013;Chiari syndrome, an obstruction to outflow in major hepatic veins) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Maher &#x0026; Schreibman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Stravitz &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Jaundice and profound anorexia may be the initial reasons the patient seeks health care. ALF is often accompanied by coagulation defects, kidney disease and electrolyte disturbances, cardiovascular abnormalities, infection, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Maher &#x0026; Schreibman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Montrief et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Stravitz &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The key to optimized treatment is rapid recognition of ALF and intensive intervention. Supporting the patient in the ICU and assessing the indications for and feasibility of liver transplantation are hallmarks of management. The use of antidotes for certain conditions may be indicated, such as <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity and penicillin for mushroom poisoning. Treatment modalities may include plasmapheresis to correct coagulopathy, to reduce serum ammonia levels, and to stabilize the patient awaiting liver transplantation, and prostaglandin therapy to enhance hepatic blood flow. Although these treatment modalities <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1393" title="1393"></span>may be implemented, no evidence exists indicating any clinical improvement with their use (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Maher &#x0026; Schreibman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Montrief et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Stravitz &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Wendon et al., 2017</a>). Hepatocytes within synthetic fiber columns have been tested as liver support systems (liver assist devices) to provide a bridge to transplantation.</p>
<p class="indent">Research into interventions for ALF has begun to focus on techniques that combine the efficacy of a whole liver with the convenience and biocompatibility of hemodialysis. The acronyms ELAD (<em>e</em>xtracorporeal <em>l</em>iver <em>a</em>ssist <em>d</em>evices) and BAL (<em>b</em>io<em>a</em>rtificial <em>l</em>iver) have been used to describe these hybrid devices. These short-term devices, which remain experimental, may help patients survive until transplantation is possible (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Villarreal &#x0026; Sussman, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Wendon et al., 2017</a>). The BAL device exposes separated plasma to a cartridge containing porcine liver cells after the plasma has flowed through a charcoal column that removes substances toxic to hepatocytes. The ELAD exposes whole blood to cartridges containing human hepatoblastoma cells, resulting in removal of toxic substances. These approaches appear promising and have had success in animal studies. In human clinical application, the use of various BAL systems has resulted in improved neurologic and biochemical parameters. Adding albumin to extracorporeal dialysis in a process known as molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), and therapeutic plasma exchanges (TPE) have been used to remove protein-bound toxins and is potentially useful in unstable patients with ALF or acute or chronic liver disease (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3257">Ba&#x00F1;ares et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Larsen, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Wendon et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In patients who have ALF with stage 4 encephalopathy (see <a href="c43-sec09.xhtml#tt43-3">Table 43-3</a>), there is a high risk of cerebral edema, a life-threatening complication. The cause is not fully understood, although disruption of the blood&#x2013;brain barrier and plasma leakage into the cerebrospinal fluid may be one cause. An increase in the intracellular osmolarity within cerebral astrocyte cells, possibly related to increased sodium and glutamine in these cells, may be another (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Montrief et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Stravitz &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>). These patients require intracranial pressure monitoring. Measures to promote adequate cerebral perfusion include careful fluid balance and hemodynamic assessments, a quiet environment, and diuresis with mannitol, an osmotic diuretic.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and sedation is indicated to prevent surges in intracranial pressure related to agitation. Other support measures include monitoring for and treating hypoglycemia, coagulopathies, and infection. Despite these treatment modalities, the mortality rate remains high. Consequently, liver transplantation (discussed later) is the treatment of choice for ALF.</p>
