<h4 class="h4" id="s2896">Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a brief period of incapacitating vertigo that occurs when the position of the patient&#x2019;s head is changed with respect to gravity, typically by placing the head back with the affected ear turned down (Mu&#x00F1;oz, Moreno, Balboa, et al., 2019; NIDCD, 2017b). The onset is sudden and followed by a predisposition for positional vertigo, usually for hours to weeks but occasionally for months or years.</p>
<p class="indent">Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is thought to be due to the disruption of debris within the semicircular canal. This debris is formed from small crystals of calcium carbonate from the inner ear structure (the utricle). This is frequently stimulated by head trauma, infection, or other events. In severe cases, vertigo may easily be induced by any head movement. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1955" title="1955"></span>The vertigo is usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting; however, hearing loss does not generally occur.</p>

<p class="indent1">Bed rest is recommended for patients with acute symptoms. Repositioning techniques can be used to treat vertigo. The canalith repositioning procedure is commonly used (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4228">Bhattacharyya, Gubbels, Schwartz, et al., 2017</a>). This noninvasive procedure, which involves quick movements of the body, rearranges the debris in the canal. The procedure is performed by placing the patient in a sitting position, turning the head to a 45-degree angle on the affected side, and then quickly moving the patient to the supine position. The procedure is safe, inexpensive, and easy to perform.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1956</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1957" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1957">p. 1957</span></div>
<p class="indent">Patients with acute vertigo may be treated with meclizine for 1 to 2 weeks. After this time, the meclizine is stopped and the patient is reassessed. Patients who continue to have severe positional vertigo may be premedicated with prochlorperazine 1 hour before the canalith repositioning procedure is performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Vestibular rehabilitation can be used in the management of vestibular disorders. This strategy promotes active use of the vestibular system through an interdisciplinary team approach, including medical and nursing care, stress management, biofeedback, vocational rehabilitation, and physical therapy. A physical therapist prescribes balance exercises that help the brain compensate for the impairment to the balance system.</p>
