<p class="nonindent">Disorders of the male reproductive system include a wide variety of conditions that usually affect both urinary and reproductive systems. Because these disorders involve the genitalia and often affect sexuality, the patient may experience anxiety and embarrassment. The nurse must be aware of the patient&#x2019;s need for privacy as well as the need for education and support. This requires an openness to discuss critical and sensitive issues with the patient, including a partner when appropriate, as well as effective assessment, management, and communication. Nurses must be comfortable when examining male genitalia and must recognize their own attitudes and perceptions about male reproductive disorders. Education of the patient and partner about treatment and self-care strategies is essential (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Tabloski, 2019</a>).</p>
