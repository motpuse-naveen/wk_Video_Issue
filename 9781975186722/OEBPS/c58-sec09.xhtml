<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cataract:&lt;/b&gt; progressive opacity of the lens of the eye">cataract</button></strong> is a lens opacity or cloudiness (see <a href="#ff58-8">Fig. 58-8</a>). Cataracts are responsible for visual disability in 18 million people worldwide (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>). By 80 years of age, more than half of all Americans have cataracts. Cataracts are a leading cause of blindness in the world (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4194">Prevent Blindness America, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2763">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cataracts can develop in one or both eyes at any age. The three most common types are traumatic, congenital, or senile cataract (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>). There are a variety of risk factors, the most common one being age (see <a href="#ct58-8">Chart 58-8</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2764">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Painless, blurry vision is characteristic of cataracts. The person perceives that surroundings are dimmer, as if their glasses need cleaning. Light scattering is common, and the person experiences reduced contrast sensitivity, sensitivity to glare, and reduced visual acuity. Other effects include myopic shift (return of ability to do close work [e.g., reading fine print] without eyeglasses), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;astigmatism:&lt;/b&gt; refractive error due to an irregularity in the curvature of the cornea">astigmatism</button></strong> (refractive error due to an irregularity in the curvature of the cornea), monocular <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diplopia:&lt;/b&gt; seeing one object as two (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; double vision)">diplopia</button></strong> (double vision), and color changes as lens becomes more brown in color (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>; <a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Shaw &#x0026; Lee, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2765">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Decreased visual acuity is directly proportionate to cataract density. The Snellen visual acuity test, ophthalmoscopy, and slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination are used to establish the degree of cataract formation. The degree of lens opacity does not always correlate with the patient&#x2019;s functional status. Some patients can perform normal activities despite clinically significant cataracts. Others with less lens opacification have a disproportionate decrease in visual acuity; hence, visual acuity is an imperfect measure of visual impairment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2766">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">No nonsurgical treatment (e.g., medications, eye drops, eyeglasses) cures cataracts or prevents age-related cataracts. Optimal medical management is prevention. Patients should be educated by primary providers about risk reduction strategies such as smoking cessation, weight reduction, optimal blood glucose control for patients with diabetes, and should be advised to wear sunglasses outdoors to prevent early cataract formation (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Shaw &#x0026; Lee, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In general, if reduced vision from cataract does not interfere with normal activities, surgery may not be needed. In deciding when cataract surgery is to be performed, the patient&#x2019;s functional and visual status should be a primary consideration (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Cataract removal is common, with more than one million such surgeries performed in the United States each year (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4194">Prevent Blindness America, 2020</a>). Surgery is performed on an outpatient basis and usually takes less than 1 hour, with the patient being discharged in 30 minutes or less afterward. Although complications from cataract surgery are uncommon, they can have significant effects on vision (see <a href="#tt58-6">Table 58-6</a>). Restoration of visual function through a safe and minimally invasive procedure is the surgical goal, which is achieved with advances in topical anesthesia, smaller wound incision (i.e., clear cornea incision), and lens <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1916" title="1916"></span>design (i.e., foldable and more accurate intraocular lens [IOL] measurements).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Injection-free topical and intraocular anesthesia, such as 1% lidocaine gel applied to the surface of the eye, eliminates the hazards of regional (retrobulbar and peribulbar) anesthesia, such as ocular perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage, optic injuries, diplopia, and ptosis, and is ideal for patients receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, patients can communicate and cooperate during surgery. IV sedation may be used to minimize anxiety and discomfort.</p>
<p class="indent">When both eyes have cataracts, one eye is treated first, with at least several weeks, preferably months, separating the two procedures. Because cataract surgery is performed to improve visual functioning, the delay for the other eye gives time for the patient and the surgeon to evaluate whether the results from the first surgery are adequate to preclude the need for a second operation. The delay also provides time for the first eye to recover; if there are any complications, the surgeon may decide to perform the second procedure differently.</p>
<p class="h7">Phacoemulsification</p>
<p class="nonindent">In this method of extracapsular cataract surgery, a portion of the anterior capsule is removed, allowing extraction of the lens nucleus and cortex while the posterior capsule and zonular support are left intact. An ultrasonic device is used to liquefy the nucleus and cortex, which are then suctioned out through a tube. An intact zonular&#x2013;capsular diaphragm provides the needed safe anchor for the posterior chamber IOL. The pupil is dilated to 7 mm or greater (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Shaw &#x0026; Lee, 2017</a>). The surgeon makes a small incision on the upper edge of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1917" title="1917"></span>the cornea and a viscoelastic substance (clear gel) is injected into the space between the cornea and the lens. This prevents the space from collapsing and facilitates insertion of the IOL. Because the incision is smaller than the manual extracapsular cataract extraction, the wound heals more rapidly, and there is early stabilization of refractive error and less astigmatism.</p>
<p class="h7">Lens Replacement</p>
<p class="nonindent">After removal of the crystalline lens, the patient is referred to as aphakic (i.e., without lens). The lens, which focuses light on the retina, must be replaced for the patient to see clearly. There are three lens replacement options: aphakic eyeglasses, contact lenses, and IOL implants.</p>
<p class="indent">Aphakic glasses, although effective, are rarely used. Objects are magnified by 25%, making them appear closer than they actually are. This magnification creates distortion. Peripheral vision is also limited, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;binocular vision:&lt;/b&gt; normal ability of both eyes to focus on one object and fuse the two images into one">binocular vision</button></strong> (i.e., ability of both eyes to focus on one object and fuse the two images into one) is impossible if the other eye is aphakic (without a natural lens).</p>
<p class="indent">Contact lenses provide patients with almost normal vision, but because contact lenses need to be removed occasionally, the patient also needs a pair of aphakic glasses. Contact lenses are not advised for patients who have difficulty inserting, removing, and cleaning them. Frequent handling and improper disinfection increase the risk of infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Insertion of IOLs during cataract surgery is the most common approach to lens replacement (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). After cataract extraction, or phacoemulsification, the surgeon implants an IOL. Cataract extraction and posterior chamber IOLs are associated with a relatively low incidence of complications (e.g., eye infection, loss of vitreous humor, slipping of the implant) (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). IOL implantation is contraindicated in patients with recurrent uveitis, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, or rubeosis iridis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2767">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Preoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with cataracts receives the usual preoperative care for ambulatory surgical patients undergoing eye surgery. The standard battery of preoperative tests (e.g., complete blood count, electrocardiogram, urinalysis) commonly performed for most surgeries is prescribed only if indicated by the patient&#x2019;s medical history.</p>
<p class="indent">Alpha-antagonists (particularly tamsulosin, which is used for treatment of enlarged prostate) are known to cause a condition called <em>intraoperative floppy iris syndrome.</em> Alpha-antagonists can interfere with pupil dilation during the surgical procedure, resulting in miosis and iris prolapse and leading to complications. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome can occur even though a patient has stopped taking the drug. The nurse needs to ask patients about a history of taking alpha-antagonists. Surgical team members are then alerted to the risk of this complication (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dilating drops are given prior to surgery. Nurses in the ambulatory surgery setting begin patient education about eye medications (antibiotic, corticosteroid, and anti-inflammatory drops) that will need to be self-administered to prevent postoperative infection and inflammation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Postoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Before discharge, the patient receives verbal and written education regarding eye protection, administration of medications, recognition of complications, activities to avoid, and obtaining emergency care (see <a href="#ct58-9">Chart 58-9</a>). An eye shield is usually worn at night for the first week to avoid injury. The nurse also explains that there should be minimal discomfort after surgery and educates the patient about taking a mild analgesic agent, such as acetaminophen, as needed. Antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and corticosteroid eye drops or ointments are prescribed postoperatively. Patients prescribed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1918" title="1918"></span>anti-inflammatory or corticosteroid eye drops are monitored for possible increases in IOP (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4193">Phulke, Kaushik, Kaur, et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">To prevent inadvertent rubbing or poking of the eye, the patient wears a protective eye patch for about the first 24 hours after surgery, followed by eyeglasses worn during the day and an eye shield at night. The nurse educates the patient and family about applying and caring for the eye shield, if one is recommended. Sunglasses should be worn while outdoors during the day because the eye is sensitive to light.</p>
<p class="indent">Slight morning discharge, some redness, and a scratchy feeling may be expected for a few days. A clean, damp washcloth may be used to remove slight morning eye discharge. Because cataract surgery increases the risk of retinal detachment, the patient must know to notify the surgeon if new floaters (moving dots) in vision, flashing lights, decrease in vision, pain, or increase in redness occur.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">If an eye patch is worn, it is removed after the first follow-up appointment, which should occur within 48 hours of surgery. Nurses should educate patients about the importance of keeping their follow-up appointments, because monitoring of visual status and prompt intervention of postoperative complications enhance good visual outcome. Vision is stabilized when the eye is completely healed, usually within 6 to 12 weeks, when final corrective prescription is completed. Visual correction may still be needed for any remaining refractive errors. Patients who choose multifocal IOLs should be aware that increased night glare and contrast sensitivity may occur.</p>
