<p class="nonindent">Patients with kidney disorders commonly experience fluid and electrolyte imbalances and require careful assessment and close monitoring for signs of potential problems. The patient whose fluid intake exceeds the ability of the kidneys to excrete fluid is said to have fluid overload. If fluid intake is inadequate, the patient is said to be volume depleted and may show signs and symptoms of fluid volume deficit. The intake and output (I&#x0026;O) record, a key monitoring tool, is used to document important fluid parameters, including the amount of fluid taken in (orally or parenterally), the volume of urine excreted, and other fluid losses (diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis). Patient weight is considered a more accurate indication of volume status than I&#x0026;O, due to the challenges and multiple variables involved in accurately monitoring I&#x0026;O. Documenting trends in weight is a key assessment strategy essential for determining the daily fluid allowance and indicating signs of fluid volume excess or deficit.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The most accurate indicator of fluid loss or gain in patients who are acutely ill is weight. An accurate daily weight must be obtained and recorded. A 1-kg weight gain is equal to 1 L (1000 mL) of retained fluid.</em></p></div>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2098">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The signs and symptoms of common fluid and electrolyte disturbances that can occur in patients with kidney disorders and general management strategies are listed in <a href="c48-sec02.xhtml#tt48-1">Table&#x00A0;48-1</a>. The nurse continually assesses, monitors, and informs appropriate members of the health care team if the patient exhibits any of these signs. Management strategies for fluid and electrolyte disturbances in kidney disease are discussed in greater depth later in this chapter (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> for more discussion of fluid and electrolyte disturbances).</p>

<p class="nonindent">With aging, the kidney is less able to respond to acute fluid and electrolyte changes. Older adult patients may develop atypical and nonspecific signs and symptoms of altered renal function and fluid and electrolyte imbalances. A fluid balance deficit in older adults can lead to falls, medication toxicity, constipation, urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, delirium, seizures, electrolyte imbalances, hyperthermia, and delayed wound healing. Recognition of acute changes in fluid and electrolytes is further hampered by their association with preexisting disorders and the misconception that they are normal changes of aging (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hain, 2017</a>).</p>
