<h4 class="h4" id="s1198">Acute Myeloid Leukemia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) originates due to a series of genetic mutations in the myeloid HSC leading to clonal development of abnormal blast cells (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2019a). As these <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;blast cells:&lt;/b&gt; immature leukocytes">blast cells</button></strong> (i.e., immature leukocytes) continue to proliferate, they crowd out normal bone marrow production resulting in anemia, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thrombocytopenia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in the number of circulating platelets; associated with the potential for bleeding">thrombocytopenia</button></strong> (i.e., low platelet count), and either low or elevated WBC counts (rarely, the WBC may be within normal range). There is also impaired development of all myeloid cells: monocytes, granulocytes (i.e., neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils), erythrocytes, and platelets.</p>
<p class="indent">AML is the most common form of leukemia, as well as most common cause of death from all leukemias. AML can affect any age group. However, the incidence of this disease increases with age, with the median age at time of diagnosis being about 68 years (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019a). On an annual basis, AML accounts for approximately 1% of all cancer-related deaths (NCCN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">The exact cause of AML is unclear, but there are several known risk factors. In addition to increasing age, males have a higher incidence than females. Other risks include having been exposed to chemicals such as benzene or pesticides or exposed to ionizing radiation; and a history of prior treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page952" title="952"></span>such as alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors, tobacco smoking, other blood disorders (e.g., myeloproliferative diseases), and several genetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome, Trisomy 8, or Fanconi anemia) (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019a).</p>

<p class="indent">The prognosis and survival rates are highly variable. Factors influencing a more positive outcome are younger age at diagnosis, more favorable cytogenetic alterations (which are strongly associated with younger age), and few concurrent (or mild) health problems. In contrast, patients with significant comorbidities, of older age, with cytogenetic features deemed to be adverse, or who are frail, are more likely to have a poor prognosis. AML evolving from a preexisting clonal myeloid disease or from prior cytotoxic therapy for another malignancy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page953" title="953"></span>or immune disease is associated with a poorer prognosis and less favorable outcomes (NCCN, 2019a).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1199">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">AML often presents, initially, as nonspecific complaints that can abruptly occur or gradually worsen over time. The signs and symptoms result from inadequate production of normal blood cells, especially as the leukemic cells increasingly crowd out the bone marrow. Symptoms due to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neutropenia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormally low absolute neutrophil count">neutropenia</button></strong> (low neutrophil count) include fever and infection. Symptoms related to anemia include pallor, fatigue, weakness, dyspnea on exertion, and dizziness. Symptoms reflective of thrombocytopenia include ecchymoses (bruises), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;petechiae:&lt;/b&gt; tiny capillary hemorrhages">petechiae</button></strong> (pinpoint red or purple hemorrhagic spots on the skin), epistaxis (nosebleeds), and gingival bleeding. The proliferation of leukemic cells within organs leads to a variety of additional symptoms: pain from an enlarged liver or spleen, hyperplasia of the gums, and bone pain from expansion of marrow (see <a href="#ff30-2">Fig. 30-2</a>). Petechiae or ecchymoses are common on the skin (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>, <a href="c29-sec09.xhtml#ff29-4">Fig. 29-4</a>); occasionally, leukemic infiltrates are also seen (see <a href="#ff30-3">Fig. 30-3</a>). Leukemic cells can also infiltrate the gingiva or synovial spaces of joints. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lymphadenopathy:&lt;/b&gt; enlargement of a lymph node or lymph nodes">Lymphadenopathy</button></strong> (enlargement of lymph nodes) or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;splenomegaly:&lt;/b&gt; enlargement of the spleen">splenomegaly</button></strong> (enlargement of the spleen) is rare. Fevers may occur and are not always due to infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1200">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">To confirm the diagnosis of AML, laboratory studies need to be performed. The complete blood count (CBC) commonly shows a decrease in both erythrocytes and platelets. Although the total leukocyte count can be low, normal, or high, the percentage of normal cells is usually vastly decreased. A bone marrow analysis shows an excess (more than 20%) of blast cells (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2203">Arber, Orazi, Hasserjian, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>); this is the hallmark of the diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">AML can be further classified into seven different subgroups, based on cytogenetics, histology, and morphology of the blasts, as well as the presence of genetic mutations. The actual prognosis varies somewhat between subgroups and with the extent of cytogenetic abnormalities and genetic mutations, yet the clinical course and treatment differ substantially with only one subtype. That is, patients with the specific AML subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, or AML-M3) have higher potential for fatal coagulopathies; however, the potential to cure this form of AML is high (NCCN, 2019a).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1201">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The overall objective of treatment for AML is to achieve complete remission of the disease, in which there is no residual leukemic cells in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. To obtain remission, chemotherapy treatment is administered in two parts: <em>induction</em> and <em>consolidation</em>. The choice of agents for induction therapy is based on the patient&#x2019;s age, physical status, and history of prior antineoplastic treatment. Induction therapy typically involves high doses of cytarabine and either daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone; etoposide is occasionally added to the regimen. Older patients (especially those older than 70 years) or those unable to tolerate standard therapy (in poor health) may receive lower-intensity therapy (using hypomethylating agents, low doses of cytarabine, or hydroxyurea), which may extend survival without a significant increase in toxicity beyond that of the underlying disease (NCCN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">During induction therapy, chemotherapy not only destroys leukemic cells, but also healthy cells, requiring patients to be hospitalized for several weeks (typically 4 to 6 weeks) due to severe and potentially life-threatening side effects, such as neutropenia. For some patients, an <strong>absolute neutrophil count (ANC</strong>; a calculation of the number of circulating neutrophils, derived from the total WBCs and the percentage of neutrophils counted in a microscope&#x2019;s visual field) of zero is not uncommon (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for formula used to calculate the ANC). Anemia, and severe thrombocytopenia (a platelet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page954" title="954"></span>count of less than 5000/mm<sup>3</sup>), is also common. During this time, the patient is typically very ill, with bacterial, fungal, and occasionally viral infections; bleeding; and severe mucositis, which cause pain, diarrhea, and an inability to maintain adequate nutrition. Management consists of administering blood products (packed red blood cells [PRBCs] and platelets) and promptly treating infections. The use of granulocytic growth factors, either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; sargramostim), may be used during the induction phase only for patients who have a life-threatening infection in order to shorten the neutropenic period (NCCN, 2019a). Patients are discharged to home once blood counts recover and the risk of infection are diminished.</p>
<p class="indent">When the patient has recovered from the induction therapy (i.e., the neutrophil and platelet counts have returned to normal and any infection has resolved), consolidation therapy is given to eliminate any residual leukemic cells that are not clinically detectable and to reduce the chance for recurrence of leukemia. Multiple treatment cycles of various agents are used, usually containing some form of cytarabine. Frequently, the patient receives one cycle of treatment that is almost the same as, if not identical to, the induction treatment but at lower dosages.</p>
<p class="indent">Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the most common form of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) used in the treatment of AML (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for discussion of HSCT). HSCT is routinely done following induction and consolidation therapy. However, in certain instances (e.g., aggressive disease), HSCT may be performed following induction. The process of HSCT requires that patients begin by receiving high-dose, aggressive chemotherapy, sometimes in tandem with radiation therapy, to destroy the hematopoietic functioning in the bone marrow and to kill any residual leukemic cells. This process is called <em>conditioning therapy</em>. Then, the patient is given human leukocyte antigen (HLA-matched) donor stems cells via intravenous (IV) infusion to reestablish bone marrow functioning and to create a new immune system (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019a). The most appropriate use and timing of HSCT remain unclear. Patients with a poorer prognosis may benefit from early HSCT; those with a good prognosis may not ever require HSCT.</p>
<p class="indent">While most patients with AML achieve remission after these treatments, some patients have refractory or relapsed disease, even after aggressive therapy. Approximately 10% to 40% of patients do not obtain a complete remission following induction therapy (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2019a). There are several other treatment options. The induction regimen might be repeated until remission or relapse occurs. Other approaches may include treatment with enasidenib, a cytarabine-based regimen, along with other agents (e.g., cladribine, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, etoposide); palliative care; or use of a hypomethylating agent (e.g., azacitidine or decitabine).</p>
<p class="indent">Supportive care may be the best treatment option to consider if the patient has significant comorbidity, such as extremely poor cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic function; is older and frail; or both. In such cases, the aggressive antileukemia therapy options previously described are not indicated; occasionally, hydroxyurea or hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine may be used briefly to control the increase of blast cells. The patient&#x2019;s symptoms may be mitigated with antimicrobial therapy and transfusions as needed. This treatment approach provides the patient with some additional time outside the hospital; however, death frequently occurs within months, typically from infection or bleeding (refer to <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for a discussion of palliative and end-of-life care).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1202">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of AML include bleeding and infection, which are the major causes of death. The risk of bleeding correlates with the level and duration of platelet deficiency. The low platelet count can cause ecchymoses and petechiae. Major hemorrhages also may develop when the platelet count drops to less than 10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. The most common bleeding sources include gastrointestinal (GI), pulmonary, vaginal, and intracranial. For undetermined reasons, fever and infection also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is common, particularly in patients with the APL subtype (NCCN, 2019a) (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for further discussion of DIC). A very high WBC count (greater than 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) can cause stasis within the cerebral or pulmonary circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the lack of mature and normal granulocytes that help fight infection, patients with leukemia are prone to infection. The likelihood of infection increases with the degree and duration of neutropenia; neutrophil counts that persist at less than 100/mm<sup>3</sup> dramatically increase the risk of systemic infections. While bacterial infections commonly occur in patients with AML who are neutropenic, the risk of developing a fungal infection also increases. Fungal infections remain difficult to treat; in many cases, patients are given antifungal agents prophylactically. Granulocytic growth factors, either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are used to stimulate the bone marrow to produce leukocytes, thereby shortening the period of neutropenia. These growth factors are not recommended for use in patients with APL, as differentiation syndrome (formerly known as retinoic acid syndrome), a life-threatening complication with symptoms such as unexplained fever, weight gain, hypotension, respiratory distress, and acute kidney injury can occur (NCCN, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Massive leukemic cell destruction from chemotherapy results in the release of intracellular electrolytes and fluids into the systemic circulation. Increases in uric acid levels, potassium, and phosphate are seen; this process is referred to as tumor lysis syndrome (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of tumor lysis syndrome). The increased uric acid and phosphorus levels make the patient vulnerable to renal stone formation and renal colic, which can progress to acute kidney injury. Hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias; hypotension; neuromuscular effects such as muscle cramps, weakness, and spasm/tetany; and confusion; and seizures may also develop (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2261">Olsen, LeFebvre, &#x0026; Brassil, 2019</a>). Patients require a high fluid intake, and prophylaxis with allopurinol or rasburicase to prevent crystallization of uric acid and subsequent stone formation.</p>
<p class="indent">GI problems may result from the infiltration of abnormal leukocytes into the abdominal organs and from the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents. Anorexia, nausea, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page955" title="955"></span>vomiting, diarrhea, and severe mucositis are common. Because of the profound myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia typically result in serious infection and increased risk of bleeding.</p>
