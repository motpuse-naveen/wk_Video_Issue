<h4 class="h4" id="s1084">Transfusion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Administration of blood and blood components requires knowledge of correct administration techniques and possible complications. It is very important to be familiar with the agency&#x2019;s policies and procedures for transfusion therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Most blood transfusions are performed in the acute care setting, and sometimes must be done emergently. Patients with long-term transfusion requirements (i.e., patients who require transfusions on an ongoing, periodic basis) often can receive transfusions in other settings. Freestanding infusion centers, ambulatory care clinics, physicians&#x2019; offices, and even patients&#x2019; homes may be appropriate settings for transfusion. Typically, patients who need long-term transfusions but are otherwise stable physically are appropriate candidates for outpatient therapy. Verification and administration of the blood product are performed as in a hospital setting. Although most blood products can be transfused in the outpatient setting, the home is typically limited to transfusions of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page900" title="900"></span>PRBCs and factor components (e.g., factor VIII for patients with hemophilia).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1085">Pretransfusion Assessment</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Patient History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient history is an important component of the pretransfusion assessment to determine the history of previous transfusions as well as previous reactions to transfusion. The history should include the type of reaction, its manifestations, the interventions required, and whether any preventive interventions were used in subsequent transfusions. The nurse assesses the number of pregnancies a woman has had, because a high number can increase her risk of reaction due to antibodies developed from exposure to fetal circulation. Other concurrent health problems should be noted, with careful attention to cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular disease. Informed consent must be obtained preprocedure (see <a href="#ct28-2">Chart 28-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Physical Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A systematic physical assessment and measurement of baseline vital signs and fluid status are important before transfusing any blood product. The respiratory system should be assessed, including careful auscultation of the lungs and the patient&#x2019;s use of accessory muscles. Cardiac system assessment should include careful inspection for any edema as well as other signs of heart failure (e.g., jugular venous distention; see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). The skin should be observed for rashes, petechiae, and ecchymoses. The sclera should be examined for icterus. In the event of a transfusion reaction, a comparison of findings can help differentiate between types of reactions.</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Can Surrogates Refuse Life-Saving Treatment?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">L.C. is a 34-year-old woman who was an unrestrained front-seat passenger in a motor vehicle crash 2 days ago. She sustained multiple trauma, including a fractured skull, traumatic brain injury, several fractured ribs, a pulmonary contusion, and a fractured right femur. After stabilization in the emergency department, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated. You are a staff nurse in the ICU and have been assigned as L.C.&#x2019;s nurse since her admission. You have come to know her family members, including her parents and her boyfriend, whom she has lived with for the past 10 months. During interdisciplinary rounds, L.C.&#x2019;s trauma surgeon notes that her hemoglobin continues to drop since admission, and is now 7.7 g/dL; he asserts that she must receive blood transfusions. L.C.&#x2019;s parents and her boyfriend are present during these rounds. L.C.&#x2019;s parents tell the trauma surgeon that they are Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, and that receiving blood transfusions is against their religious beliefs. L.C.&#x2019;s boyfriend notes that she no longer adheres to the tenets of Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses and does not attend any religious meetings or services. L.C.&#x2019;s parents become angry and tell her boyfriend that they are the ones to make decisions on L.C.&#x2019;s behalf. L.C. does not have an advance directive or a power-of-attorney for health care.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Whenever a patient lacks capacity to make their own health care decisions, those decisions are made by a legally identified surrogate. Had L.C. identified who that surrogate should be in a power-of-attorney for health care document, that person would have the rights and responsibilities to make those decisions. Since that document does not exist, and since L.C. does not have a spouse, her parents are her legal surrogates and authorized to make those decisions on her behalf.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Had L.C. written an advance directive and specified whether or not she would wish to receive blood transfusions for life-threatening contingencies, that specification would be legally binding. For instance, had she noted in an advance directive that she would <em>not</em> wish to receive blood transfusions, even if that meant that she would die, that would be a legally binding decision, even if her parents wished for her to receive blood transfusions.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">However, L.C.&#x2019;s parents and her boyfriend disagree about what they believe L.C. would want to be done in this situation. Surrogates are charged with making decisions on behalf of patients who lack capacity. However, that charge is predicated on the belief that surrogates know which decision is consistent with what the patient would have wanted when the patient could have made a reasoned decision. It is noteworthy that L.C.&#x2019;s parents insist that she not be transfused since it is against <em>their</em> religious beliefs. However, they do not note that their beliefs are also consistent with L.C.&#x2019;s beliefs.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chapter 1, Chart 1-7</a>). Is it possible to preserve L.C.&#x2019;s autonomy, given that she lacks capacity at this time, and given the conflict between her family members?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>There is a conflict between legal rights and moral decisions in this case. Are there situations where the decision that a legal surrogate makes for a patient who lacks capacity could and should be overturned?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What if a family meeting is called to try to resolve the conflict between L.C.&#x2019;s parents and her boyfriend, and her boyfriend is able to provide evidence that L.C. does not adhere to the tenets of the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness faith? By contrast, what if her parents are able to provide evidence that L.C. has been faithfully attending Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses meetings for the past 10 months and that she has explicitly told her parents that she would not ever wish to have blood transfusions? Finally, what if L.C.&#x2019;s parents and her boyfriend each express that none of them are certain what decision L.C. would make in this situation? Would the trauma surgeon be justified in then upholding the principle of beneficence and prescribe blood transfusions for L.C., despite her parents&#x2019; objections? If those transfusions were prescribed, would you administer the blood transfusions or would you object?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be mobilized to be of assistance to L.C.&#x2019;s family and the health care team so that the decision that best respects L.C.&#x2019;s wishes might be made?</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1086"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Patient Education</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Reviewing the signs and symptoms of a transfusion reaction is crucial with all patients, including those who have and have not received a previous transfusion. Signs and symptoms of a reaction include fever, chills, respiratory distress, low back pain, nausea, pain at the IV site, or anything &#x201C;unusual.&#x201D; Although a thorough review is very important, the nurse also reassures the patient that the blood is carefully tested against the patient&#x2019;s own blood (cross-matched) to diminish the likelihood of any untoward reaction. Similarly, the patient can be reassured about the very low possibility of contracting HIV from the transfusion; this fear persists among many people.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1087">Transfusion Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Methods for transfusing blood components and the role of the nurse in assessing patients before, during, and after these procedures are described in <a href="#ct28-3">Charts 28-3</a> and <a href="#ct28-4">28-4</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1088">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Any patient who receives a blood transfusion is at risk for developing complications from the transfusion. Nursing management is directed toward preventing complications, promptly recognizing complications if they develop, and promptly initiating measures to control complications. Nurses assess patients&#x2019; vital signs before, during, and after a blood transfusion is complete to screen for any adverse reactions; however, the optimal frequency for assessing these vital signs during the transfusion is not well established (<a href="#bib2054">Cortez-Gann, Gilmore, Foley, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct28-5">Chart 28-5</a>). The following sections describe the most common or potentially severe transfusion-related complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Febrile Nonhemolytic Reaction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A febrile nonhemolytic reaction is caused by antibodies to donor leukocytes that remain in the unit of blood or blood component; it is the most common type of transfusion reaction (<a href="#bib2079">Stubbs, 2018</a>). It occurs more frequently in patients who have had previous transfusions (exposure to multiple antigens from previous blood products) and in Rh-negative women who have borne Rh-positive children (exposure to an Rh-positive fetus raises antibody levels in the untreated mother).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The diagnosis of a febrile nonhemolytic reaction is made by excluding other potential causes, such as a hemolytic reaction or bacterial contamination of the blood product. The signs and symptoms of a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction are chills (minimal to severe) followed by fever (more than 1&#x00B0;C elevation). The fever typically begins within 2 hours after the transfusion has begun. Although the reaction is not life threatening, the fever, and particularly the chills and muscle stiffness, can be frightening to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">This reaction can be diminished, even prevented, by further depleting the blood component of donor leukocytes; this is accomplished by a leukocyte reduction filter. Antipyretic agents can be given to prevent fever; however, routine premedication is not advised because it can mask the beginning of a more serious transfusion reaction.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acute Hemolytic Reaction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most dangerous, and potentially life-threatening, type of transfusion reaction occurs when the donor blood is incompatible with that of the recipient (i.e., type II hypersensitivity reaction). Antibodies already present in the recipient&#x2019;s plasma rapidly combine with antigens on donor erythrocytes, and the erythrocytes are destroyed in the circulation (i.e., intravascular hemolysis). The most rapid hemolysis occurs in ABO incompatibility. Rh incompatibility often causes a less severe reaction. This reaction can occur after transfusion of as little as 10 mL of PRBCs. Although the overall incidence of such reactions is not high (1:20,000 to 1:40,000 units transfused) (<a href="#bib2065">Robinson, New, Shackleton, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>), they are largely preventable. The most common causes of acute hemolytic reaction are errors in blood component labeling, a type of clerical error, and errors in patient identification that result in the administration of an ABO-incompatible transfusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Symptoms consist of fever, chills, low back pain, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and anxiety. As the erythrocytes are destroyed, the hemoglobin is released from the cells and excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hemoglobin appears in the urine (hemoglobinuria). Hypotension, bronchospasm, and vascular collapse may result. Diminished renal perfusion results in acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may also occur. The reaction must be recognized promptly and the transfusion discontinued immediately (see the Nursing Management of Transfusion Reactions section).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Blood Transfusions and Vital Sign Frequency</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Cortez-Gann, J., Gilmore, K. D., Foley, K. W., et&#x00A0;al. (2017). Blood transfusion vital sign frequency: What does the evidence say? <em>MEDSURG Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>26</em>(2), 89&#x2013;92.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses are responsible for assuring patient safety during a blood transfusion through effective monitoring of vital signs. When and how often to take vital signs varies, based upon institutional protocols. There are no evidence-based research findings that provide direction regarding optimal timing and frequency of vital sign monitoring for patients who receive blood transfusions. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to discover the relationship between vital sign findings and blood transfusion-associated adverse events in order to find patterns suggestive of optimal vital sign timing and frequency for patients receiving blood transfusions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in a 921-bed hospital where approximately 77,800 units of blood products were transfused during 2008 through 2012. Of those patients transfused during this time, 116 experienced a blood transfusion reaction. Using a medical record data collection tool, information from these 116 patients was collected including demographics, type of blood product administered, transfusion start and stop times, vital signs before, during, and after transfusion, symptomatology and treatment protocol for the transfusion reaction, and patient outcomes.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Packed red blood cells were the most commonly transfused product. Of the 116 sampled patients who experienced a transfusion reaction, 67% were over 60 years of age. The most common changes among vital signs were an increase in temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. Six of the 116 patients with transfusion reactions experienced severe life-threatening complications from the blood transfusion, but none died from them. The average time from the start of transfusion to an adverse reaction was approximately 92 minutes, with the quickest documented response occurring 5 minutes after initiation of the transfusion and the most delayed reaction taking place 2 hours and 30 minutes after the start of the transfusion.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Hospitals endorse different protocols that dictate when and how often nurses take vital signs for patients who receive blood products. While it is commonly believed that the most likely time for a patient to experience a transfusion reaction is within the first 15 minutes after the start of a transfusion, findings from this study established an average time to the reaction of 1.5 hours, with the most severe reaction occurring 2 hours after initiation of the transfusion. Only one severe reaction in this study occurred during the first 15 minutes of the transfusion period. Findings from this study suggest that nurses should take vital signs of patients receiving blood transfusions at periodic intervals during the entire timeframe that a patient receives a blood transfusion.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are preventable. Meticulous attention to detail in labeling blood samples and blood components and accurately identifying the recipient cannot be overemphasized. Bar coding methods can be useful safeguards in matching a patient&#x2019;s wristband with the label on the blood component; however, these methods are not fail proof and do not reduce the nurse&#x2019;s responsibility to ensure the correct blood component is transfused to the correct patient (<a href="#bib2065">Robinson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Allergic Reaction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Some patients develop urticaria (hives) or generalized itching during a transfusion; the cause is thought to be a sensitivity reaction to a plasma protein within the blood component being transfused. Symptoms of an allergic reaction are urticaria, itching, and flushing. The reactions are usually mild and respond to antihistamines. If the symptoms resolve after administration of an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine), the transfusion may be resumed. Rarely, the allergic reaction is severe, with bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and shock. These reactions are managed with epinephrine, corticosteroids, and vasopressor support, if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Giving the patient antihistamines or corticosteroids before the transfusion may prevent future reactions. For severe reactions, future blood components are washed to remove any remaining plasma proteins. Leukocyte filters are not useful to prevent such reactions, because the offending plasma proteins can pass through the filter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If too much blood is infused too quickly, hypervolemia can occur. This condition, known as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), can be aggravated in patients who already have increased circulatory volume (e.g., those with heart failure, renal dysfunction, advanced age, acute myocardial infarction) (<a href="#bib2079">Carman, Uhlenbrock, &#x0026; McClintock, 2018</a>). A careful assessment for signs of circulatory overload or positive fluid status prior to initiating the transfusion is required, particularly in patients at risk for developing transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (see discussion below). PRBCs are safer to use than whole blood. If the administration rate is sufficiently slow, circulatory overload may be prevented. For patients who are at risk for, or already in, circulatory overload, diuretics are given prior to the transfusion or between units of PRBCs. Patients receiving fresh-frozen plasma or even platelets may also develop circulatory overload. The infusion rate of these blood components must also be titrated to the patient&#x2019;s tolerance. Rates of transfusion may need to decrease to less than 100 to 120 mL/h (<a href="#bib2079">Henneman, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Signs of circulatory overload include dyspnea, orthopnea, tachycardia, an increase in blood pressure, and sudden anxiety. Jugular vein distention, crackles at the base of the lungs, and hypoxemia will also develop. Pulmonary edema can quickly develop, as manifested by severe dyspnea and coughing of pink, frothy sputum.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 903</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page904" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="904">p. 904</span></div>
<p class="indent">If fluid overload is mild, the transfusion can often be continued after slowing the rate of infusion and administering diuretics. However, if the overload is severe, the patient is placed upright with the feet in a dependent position, the transfusion is discontinued, and the primary provider is notified. The IV line is kept patent with a very slow infusion of normal saline solution or a saline lock device to maintain access to the vein in case IV medications are necessary. Oxygen and morphine may be needed to treat severe dyspnea (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">TACO can develop as late as 6 hours after transfusion (<a href="#bib2079">Henneman, 2017</a>). Therefore, patients need close monitoring after the transfusion is completed, particularly those who are at higher risk for developing this complication (e.g., older adults, those with a positive fluid balance prior to transfusion, patients with renal dysfunction, patients with left ventricular dysfunction). Monitoring vital signs, auscultating breath sounds, and assessing for jugular venous distention should be included in patient monitoring.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bacterial Contamination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of bacterial contamination of blood components is very low; however, administration of contaminated products puts the patient at great risk. Contamination can occur at any point during procurement or processing but often results from organisms on the donor&#x2019;s skin. Many bacteria cannot survive in the cold temperatures used to store PRBCs, but some organisms can. Platelets are at greater risk of contamination because they are stored at room temperature. In response to this, blood centers have developed rapid methods of culturing platelet units, thereby diminishing the risk of using a contaminated platelet unit for transfusion (CDC, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Preventive measures include meticulous care in the procurement and processing of blood components. When PRBCs or whole blood is transfused, it should be given within a 4-hour period, because warm room temperatures promote bacterial growth. A contaminated unit of blood product may appear normal, or it may have an abnormal color.</p>
<p class="indent">The signs of bacterial contamination are fever, chills, and hypotension. These manifestations may not occur until the transfusion is complete, and occasionally not until several hours after the transfusion. As soon as the reaction is recognized, any remaining transfusion is discontinued (see the Nursing Management of Transfusion Reactions section). If the condition is not treated immediately with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, sepsis can occur. Sepsis is treated with IV fluids and antibiotics; corticosteroids and vasopressors are often also necessary (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">TRALI is a potentially fatal, idiosyncratic reaction that is defined as the development of acute lung injury occurring within 6 hours after the blood transfusion. All blood components have been implicated in TRALI, including IVIG, cryoprecipitate, and stem cells. TRALI is the most common cause of transfusion-related death (<a href="#bib2079">Heering &#x0026; Karakashian, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism for TRALI is unknown but is thought to involve specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or human neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies in the donor&#x2019;s plasma that react to the leukocytes in the recipient&#x2019;s blood. Occasionally, the reverse occurs, and antibodies present in the recipient&#x2019;s plasma agglutinate the antigens on the few remaining leukocytes in the blood component being transfused. Another theory suggests that an initial insult to the patient&#x2019;s vascular endothelium can predispose the neutrophils to aggregate at the injured endothelium. Various substances within the transfused blood component (lipids, cytokines) then activate these neutrophils. Each of these pathophysiologic mechanisms can contribute to the process. The end result of this process is interstitial and intra-alveolar edema, as well as extensive sequestration of WBCs within the pulmonary capillaries (<a href="#bib2079">Heering &#x0026; Karakashian, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Onset is abrupt (usually within 6 hours of transfusion, often within 2 hours). Signs and symptoms include acute shortness of breath, hypoxia (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO<sub>2</sub>] less than 90%; partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>] to fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO<sub>2</sub>] ratio of less than 300), hypotension, fever, and eventual pulmonary edema. Diagnostic criteria include hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (seen on chest x-ray), no evidence of cardiac cause for the pulmonary edema, and no other plausible alternative cause within 6 hours of completing transfusion. Aggressive supportive therapy (e.g., oxygen, intubation, fluid support) may prevent death. Immunologic therapy (e.g., corticosteroids) has not been shown to be effective in this setting; diuretics can worsen the situation (<a href="#bib2064">Raja, Rahul, Kumar, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although TRALI can occur with the transfusion of any blood component, it is more likely to occur when plasma and, to a lesser extent, platelets are transfused. One commonly used preventive strategy involves limiting the frequency and amount of blood products transfused. Another entails obtaining plasma and possibly platelets only from men because women who have been pregnant may have developed offending antibodies. A third strategy involves screening donors for the presence of these antibodies and discarding any plasma-containing blood products from those donors who screen positive. The efficacy of these approaches in preventing TRALI remains unclear (<a href="#bib2079">Otrock, Liu, &#x0026; Grossman, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Delayed Hemolytic Reaction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Delayed hemolytic reactions usually occur within 14 days after transfusion, when the level of antibody has been increased to the extent that a reaction can occur (<a href="#bib2067">Siddon, Kenney, Hendrickson, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The hemolysis of the erythrocytes is extravascular via the RES and occurs gradually.</p>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms of a delayed hemolytic reaction are fever, anemia, increased bilirubin level, decreased or absent haptoglobin, and possibly jaundice. Rarely, there is hemoglobinuria. Generally, these reactions are not dangerous, but it is important to recognize them because subsequent transfusions with blood products containing these antibodies may cause a more severe hemolytic reaction. However, recognition is also difficult because the patient may not be in a health care setting to be tested for this reaction, and even if the patient is hospitalized, the reaction may be too mild to be recognized clinically. Because the amount of antibody present can be too low to detect, it is difficult to prevent delayed hemolytic reactions. Fortunately, the reaction is usually mild and requires no intervention (<a href="#bib2067">Siddon et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Disease Acquisition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Despite advances in donor screening and blood testing, certain diseases can still be transmitted by transfusion of blood components (see <a href="#ct28-6">Chart 28-6</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Complications of Long-Term Transfusion Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The complications that have been described represent a real risk to any patient any time a blood component is given. However, patients with long-term transfusion requirements (e.g., those with myelodysplastic syndrome, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease) are at greater risk for infection transmission and for becoming more sensitized to donor antigens, simply because they are exposed to more units of blood and, consequently, more donors. A summary of complications associated with long-term transfusion therapy is given in <a href="#tt28-5">Table 28-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Iron overload is a complication unique to people who have had long-term PRBC transfusions. One unit of PRBCs contains 250 mg of iron. Patients with long-term transfusion requirements can quickly acquire more iron than they can use, leading to iron overload. Over time, the excess iron deposits in body tissues can cause organ damage, particularly in the liver, heart, testes, and pancreas. Promptly initiating a program of iron chelation therapy can prevent end-organ damage from iron toxicity (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>, Hereditary Hemochromatosis, Nursing Management, and Chapter 30, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Nursing Management).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1089">Nursing Management of Transfusion Reactions</h5>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1090">Pharmacologic Alternatives to Blood Transfusions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic agents that stimulate the production of one or more types of blood cells by the marrow are commonly used (see <a href="#ct28-7">Chart 28-7</a>). Researchers continue to seek a blood substitute that is practical and safe. Manufacturing artificial blood is problematic, given the myriad functions of blood components. Currently, there are two types of products in development: hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and perfluorocarbons <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page907" title="907"></span>(which can dissolve gases and thus carry oxygen indirectly); none are approved for use in humans, to date (<a href="#bib2079">Adams, 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box12pTitlen">Pharmacologic Alternatives to Blood Transfusions</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Growth Factors</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Recombinant technology has provided a means to produce hematopoietic growth factors necessary for the production of blood cells within the bone marrow. By increasing the body&#x2019;s production of blood cells, transfusions and complications resulting from diminished blood cells (e.g., infection from neutropenia) may be avoided. However, the successful use of growth factors requires functional bone marrow. Moreover, the safety of these products has been questioned, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is limiting their use in some patient populations.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Erythropoietin</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Erythropoietin (epoetin alfa; darbopoietin) is an effective alternative treatment for patients with chronic anemia secondary to diminished levels of erythropoietin, as in chronic kidney disease. This medication stimulates erythropoiesis. It also has been used for patients who are anemic from chemotherapy or zidovudine (AZT) therapy and for those who have diseases involving bone marrow suppression, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The use of erythropoietin can also enable a patient to donate several units of blood for future use (e.g., preoperative autologous donation). The medication can be administered IV or subcutaneously, although plasma levels are better sustained with the subcutaneous route. Side effects are rare, but erythropoietin can cause or exacerbate hypertension. If the anemia is corrected too quickly or is overcorrected, the elevated hematocrit can cause headache and, potentially, seizures. Thrombosis has been noted in some patients whose hemoglobins were raised to a high level; thus, it is recommended that a target hemoglobin level of less than 12 g/dL be used. These adverse effects are rare except for patients with renal failure. Serial complete blood counts (CBCs) must be performed to evaluate the response to the medication. The dose and frequency of administration are titrated to the hemoglobin level.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">G-CSF (filgrastim) is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid stem cells; a rapid increase in neutrophils is seen within the circulation. G-CSF is effective in improving transient but severe neutropenia after chemotherapy or in some forms of MDS. It is particularly useful in preventing bacterial infections that would be likely to occur with neutropenia. G-CSF is given subcutaneously on a daily basis. The primary side effect is bone pain; this probably reflects the increase in hematopoiesis within the marrow. Serial CBCs should be performed to evaluate the response to the medication and to ensure that the rise in white blood cells is not excessive. The effect of G-CSF on myelopoiesis is short; the neutrophil count drops once the medication is stopped.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">GM-CSF (sargramostim) is a cytokine that is naturally produced by a variety of cells, including monocytes and endothelial cells. It works either directly or synergistically with other growth factors to stimulate myelopoiesis. GM-CSF is not as specific to neutrophils as is G-CSF; thus, an increase in erythroid (red blood cell) and megakaryocytic (platelet) production may also be seen. GM-CSF serves the same purpose as G-CSF. However, it may have a greater effect on macrophage function and therefore may be more useful against fungal infections, whereas G-CSF may be better used to fight bacterial infections. GM-CSF is also given subcutaneously. Side effects include bone pain, fevers, and myalgias.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Thrombopoietin</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a cytokine that is necessary for the proliferation of megakaryocytes and subsequent platelet formation. Nonimmunogenic second-generation thrombopoietic growth factors (romiplostim; eltrombopag) are used for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Eltrombopag is also approved for use in certain situations for patients with aplastic anemia and in patients requiring hepatitis C treatment that can cause significant thrombocytopenia.</p>
