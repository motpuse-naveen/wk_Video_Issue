<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;postanesthesia care unit (PACU):&lt;/b&gt; area where postoperative patients are monitored as they recover from anesthesia">postanesthesia care unit</button></strong> (PACU) is located adjacent to the OR suite. Patients still under anesthesia or recovering from anesthesia are placed in this unit for easy access to experienced, highly skilled nurses, anesthesia providers, surgeons, advanced hemodynamic and pulmonary monitoring and support, special equipment, and medications.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s514">Phases of Postanesthesia Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In some hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, postanesthesia care is divided into two phases (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Rothrock, 2019</a>). In the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;phase I PACU:&lt;/b&gt; area designated for care of surgical patients immediately after surgery and for patients whose condition warrants close monitoring">phase I PACU</button></strong>, used during the immediate recovery phase, intensive nursing care is provided. After this phase, the patient transitions to the next phase of care as either an inpatient to a nursing unit or phase II PACU. In the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;phase II PACU:&lt;/b&gt; area designated for care of surgical patients who have been transferred from a phase I PACU because their condition no longer requires the close monitoring provided in a phase I PACU. The patient is prepared for transfer to an inpatient unit or for discharge from the facility">phase II PACU</button></strong>, the patient is prepared for transfer to an inpatient nursing unit, an extended care setting, or discharge. Recliners rather than stretchers or beds are standard in many phase II units, which may also be referred to as step-down, sit-up, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page438" title="438"></span>progressive care units. Patients remain in PACU until they have met predetermined discharge criteria, depending on the type of surgery and any preexisting conditions or comorbidities. In facilities without separate phase I and II units, the patient remains in the PACU and may be discharged home directly from this unit.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s515">Admitting the Patient to the Postanesthesia Care Unit</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Transferring the postoperative patient from the OR to the PACU is the responsibility of the anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) and other licensed members of the OR team. During transport from the OR to the PACU, the anesthesia provider remains at the head of the stretcher (to maintain the airway), and a surgical team member remains at the opposite end. Transporting the patient involves special consideration of the incision site, potential vascular changes, and exposure. The surgical incision is considered every time the postoperative patient is moved; many wounds are closed under considerable tension, and every effort is made to prevent further strain on the incision. The patient is positioned so that they are not lying on and obstructing drains or drainage tubes. Orthostatic hypotension may occur when a patient is moved too quickly from one position to another (e.g., from a lithotomy position to a horizontal position or from a lateral to a supine position), so the patient must be moved slowly and carefully. As soon as the patient is placed on the stretcher or bed, the soiled gown is removed and replaced with a dry gown. The patient is covered with lightweight blanket or a forced air warming blanket.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse who admits the patient to the PACU reviews essential information with the anesthesiologist or CRNA (see <a href="#ct16-1">Chart&#x00A0;16-1</a>) and the circulating nurse. Oxygen is applied, monitoring equipment is attached, and an immediate physiologic assessment is conducted.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s516">Nursing Management in the Postanesthesia Care Unit</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nursing management objectives for the patient in the PACU are to provide care until the patient has recovered from the effects of anesthesia. PACU nurses have unique competencies as they care for patients who have undergone a wide range of surgical procedures. Recovery criteria include a return to baseline cognitive function, the airway is clear, nausea and vomiting is controlled, and vital signs are stabilized. The nurse in the PACU uses critical care skills and training to detect early subtle changes that could lead to complications (i.e., hemorrhage or respiratory distress) without intervention (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1305">American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses [ASPAN], 2019</a>; <a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients, particularly those who have had extensive or lengthy surgical procedures, may be transferred from the OR directly to the intensive care unit (ICU) or from the PACU to the ICU while still intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. In most facilities, the patient is awakened and extubated in the OR (except in cases of trauma or critical illness) and arrives in the PACU breathing without ventilatory support.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Patient</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse performs frequent, basic assessments of every postoperative patient. These assessments include airway, level of consciousness, cardiac, respiratory, wound, and pain. The patient&#x2019;s comorbidities and type of procedure will dictate additional assessments such as peripheral pulses, hemodynamics, and surgical drain placements (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). A baseline of any postanesthesia assessment scoring tool, such as the Aldrete score, is performed at this time as well (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1315">Aldrete &#x0026; Wright, 1992</a>). See discussion of this score later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse performs and documents a baseline assessment, checks all drainage tubes, and verifies that monitoring lines are connected and functioning. IV fluids and medications currently infusing are checked, and the nurse verifies that they are infusing at the correct dosage and rate. Vital signs are assessed at time of arrival to PACU and repeated at intervals (i.e., every 5 or 15 minutes) per institutional protocol. The nurse must be aware of any pertinent information from the patient&#x2019;s history that may be significant (e.g., patient is deaf or hard of hearing, has a history of seizures, has diabetes, or is allergic to certain medications or to latex).</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">Following surgery, patients who had ketamine as anesthesia must be placed in a quiet, darkened area of the PACU. See <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <a href="c15-sec04.xhtml#tt15-2">Table&#x00A0;15-2</a> for more information about anesthetic agents.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining a Patent Airway</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The primary objective in the immediate postoperative period is to maintain ventilation and thus prevent hypoxemia (reduced oxygen in the blood) and hypercapnia (excess carbon dioxide in the blood). Both can occur if the airway is obstructed and ventilation is reduced (hypoventilation). Besides administering supplemental oxygen as prescribed, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page439" title="439"></span>nurse assesses respiratory rate and depth, ease of respirations, oxygen saturation, and breath sounds.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff16-1">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff16-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff16-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;16-1 &#x2022;</span> <strong>A.</strong> A hypopharyngeal obstruction occurs when neck flexion permits the chin to drop toward the chest; obstruction almost always occurs when the head is in the midposition. <strong>B.</strong> Tilting the head back to stretch the anterior neck structure lifts the base of the tongue off the posterior pharyngeal wall. The direction of the <em>arrows</em> indicates the pressure of the hands. <strong>C.</strong> Opening the mouth is necessary to correct a valvelike obstruction of the nasal passage during expiration, which occurs in about 30% of unconscious patients. Open the patient&#x2019;s mouth (separate lips and teeth) and move the lower jaw forward so that the lower teeth are in front of the upper teeth. To regain backward tilt of the neck, lift with both hands at the ascending rami of the mandible.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Patients who have experienced prolonged anesthesia usually are unconscious, with all muscles relaxed. This relaxation extends to the muscles of the pharynx. When the patient lies on the back, the lower jaw and the tongue fall backward and the air passages become obstructed (<a href="#ff16-1">Fig.&#x00A0;16-1</a>A). This is called <em>hypopharyngeal obstruction.</em> Signs of occlusion include choking; noisy and irregular respirations; decreased oxygen saturation scores; and, within minutes, a blue, dusky color (cyanosis) of the skin. Because movement of the thorax and the diaphragm does not necessarily indicate that the patient is breathing, the nurse needs to place the palm of the hand at the patient&#x2019;s nose and mouth to feel the exhaled breath.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The treatment of hypopharyngeal obstruction involves tilting the head back and pushing forward on the angle of the lower jaw, as if to push the lower teeth in front of the upper teeth (see <a href="#ff16-1">Fig.&#x00A0;16-1</a>B,C). This maneuver pulls the tongue forward and opens the air passages.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The anesthesiologist or CRNA may place a temporary, hard rubber or plastic airway in the patient&#x2019;s mouth to maintain a patent airway (see <a href="#ff16-2">Fig.&#x00A0;16-2</a>). Such a device should not be removed until signs such as gagging indicate that reflex action is returning. Alternatively, the patient may enter the PACU with an endotracheal tube still in place and may require continued mechanical ventilation. The nurse assists in initiating the use of the ventilator as well as the weaning and extubation processes.</p>
<p class="indent">If the teeth are clenched, the mouth may be opened manually but cautiously with a padded tongue depressor. The head of the bed is elevated 15 to 30 degrees unless contraindicated, and the patient is closely monitored to maintain the airway as well as to minimize the risk of aspiration. If vomiting occurs, the patient is turned to the side to prevent aspiration and the vomitus is collected in the emesis basin. Mucus or vomitus obstructing the pharynx or the trachea is suctioned with a pharyngeal suction tip or a nasal catheter introduced into the nasopharynx or oropharynx to a distance of 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inch). Caution is necessary in suctioning the throat of a patient who has had a tonsillectomy or other oral or laryngeal surgery because of the risk of bleeding and discomfort.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Cardiovascular Stability</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To monitor cardiovascular stability, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness; vital signs; cardiac rhythm; skin temperature, color, and moisture; and urine output. The nurse also assesses the patency of all IV lines. The primary cardiovascular complications seen in the PACU include hypotension and shock, hemorrhage, hypertension, and arrhythmias.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients who are critically ill, have significant comorbidity, or have undergone riskier procedures, additional monitoring may have been done in the OR and will continue in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page440" title="440"></span>the PACU. These may include central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and cardiac output.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff16-2">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff16-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff16-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;16-2 &#x2022;</span> The use of an airway to maintain a patent airway after anesthesia. The airway passes over the base of the tongue and permits air to pass into the pharynx in the region of the epiglottis. Patients often leave the operating room with an airway in place. The airway should remain in place until the patient recovers sufficiently to breathe normally. As the patient regains consciousness, the airway usually causes irritation and should be removed.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Hypotension and Shock</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hypotension can result from blood loss, hypoventilation, position changes, pooling of blood in the extremities, or side effects of medications and anesthetics. The most common cause is loss of circulating volume through blood and plasma loss. If the amount of blood loss exceeds 500 mL (especially if the loss is rapid), replacement may be considered.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>A systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg is usually considered immediately reportable. However, the patient&#x2019;s preoperative or baseline blood pressure is used to make informed postoperative comparisons. A previously stable blood pressure that shows a downward trend of 5 mm Hg at each 15-minute reading should also be reported.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Types of shock are classified as hypovolemic, cardiogenic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and septic. The most common type of shock in the postoperative setting is hypovolemic and is associated with hemorrhage from the surgical site (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). The classic signs of hypovolemic shock are pallor; cool, moist skin; rapid breathing; cyanosis of the lips, gums, and tongue; rapid, weak, thready pulse; narrowing pulse pressure; low blood pressure; and concentrated urine (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for a detailed discussion of shock).</p>
<p class="indent">Hypovolemic shock can be avoided largely by the timely administration of IV fluids, blood, blood products, and medications that elevate blood pressure. The primary intervention for hypovolemic shock is volume replacement, with an infusion of lactated Ringer solution, 0.9% sodium chloride solution, colloids, or blood component therapy (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="c11-sec04.xhtml#tt11-3">Table&#x00A0;11-3</a>). Oxygen is given by nasal cannula, facemask, or mechanical ventilation. If fluid administration fails to reverse hypovolemic shock, then various cardiac, vasodilator, and corticosteroid medications may be prescribed to improve cardiac function and reduce peripheral vascular resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">The PACU bed can readily be positioned to facilitate the use of measures to counteract shock. The patient is placed flat with the legs elevated, usually with a pillow. Respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen concentration, urinary output, and level of consciousness are monitored to provide information on the patient&#x2019;s respiratory and cardiovascular status. Vital signs are monitored continuously until the patient&#x2019;s condition has stabilized.</p>
<p class="indent">Other factors can contribute to hemodynamic instability, such as body temperature and pain. The PACU nurse implements measures to manage these factors. The nurse keeps the patient warm (while avoiding overheating to prevent cutaneous vessels from dilating and depriving vital organs of blood), avoids exposure, and maintains normothermia (to prevent vasodilation). Pain control measures are implemented, as discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="h7">Hemorrhage</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hemorrhage is an uncommon yet serious complication of surgery that can result in hypovolemic shock and death. It can present insidiously or emergently at any time in the immediate postoperative period or up to several days after surgery (see <a href="#tt16-1">Table&#x00A0;16-1</a>). The patient presents with hypotension; rapid, thready pulse; disorientation; restlessness; oliguria; and cold, pale skin. The early phase of shock will manifest in feelings of apprehension, decreased cardiac output, and vascular resistance. Breathing becomes labored, and &#x201C;air hunger&#x201D; will be exhibited; the patient will feel cold (hypothermia) and may experience tinnitus. Laboratory values may show a sharp drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. If shock symptoms are left untreated, the patient will continually grow weaker but can remain conscious until near death (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Determining the cause of hemorrhage includes assessing the surgical site and incision for bleeding. If bleeding is evident, a sterile gauze pad and a pressure dressing are applied, and the site of the bleeding is elevated to heart level if possible. The patient is placed in the shock position (flat on back; legs elevated at a 20-degree angle; knees kept straight). Severe bleeding requires immediate action by the nurse. The surgeon is called and preparations are made to return the patient to the OR for ligation of bleeding veins and arteries, hematoma evacuation, or other necessary surgical interventions to stop the bleeding (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If hemorrhage is suspected, the nurse should be aware of any special considerations related to blood loss replacement. The treatment of hemorrhage is infusion of crystalloid and possibly blood product. Patients with blood loss of over 1500 mL should be considered for blood administration (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Henry, 2018</a>). Nurses in the PACU should be aware that patients may decline blood transfusions for religious or cultural reasons and may identify this request on their advance directives or living will.</p>
<p class="h7">Hypertension and Arrhythmias</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is common in the immediate postoperative period secondary to sympathetic nervous system stimulation from pain, hypoxia, or bladder distention. Arrhythmias are associated with electrolyte imbalance, altered respiratory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page441" title="441"></span>function, pain, hypothermia, stress, and anesthetic agents. Both hypertension and arrhythmias are managed by treating the underlying causes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Pain and Anxiety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse in the PACU monitors the patient&#x2019;s physiologic status, manages pain, and provides psychological support in an effort to relieve the patient&#x2019;s fears and concerns. The nurse checks the electronic health record (EHR) for special needs and concerns of the patient. Opioid analgesic medications are given mostly by IV in the PACU (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Rothrock, 2019</a>). IV opioids provide immediate pain relief and are short acting, thus minimizing the potential for drug interactions or prolonged respiratory depression while anesthetics are still active in the patient&#x2019;s system (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1307">Barash, Cullen, Stoelting, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). (See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for more information about pain management.) When the patient&#x2019;s condition permits, a close member of the family may visit in the PACU to decrease the family&#x2019;s anxiety and make the patient feel more secure. The nurse should consider providing nonpharmacologic, emotional, and psychological support to the patient. These include massage, acupuncture, heat or cold packs, relaxation and breathing techniques, guided imagery, and soothing music (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Controlling Nausea and Vomiting</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) occurs in about 30% to 50% of surgical patients (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1335">Thomas, Maple, Williams, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The nurse should intervene at the patient&#x2019;s first report of nausea to control the problem rather than wait for it to progress to vomiting.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>At the slightest indication of nausea, the patient is turned completely to one side to promote mouth drainage and prevent aspiration of vomitus, which can cause pneumonia, asphyxiation, and death.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">PONV is controlled via medication administered intraoperatively and postoperatively. <a href="#tt16-2">Table&#x00A0;16-2</a> contains select medications prescribed to control PONV. Studies suggest that nonpharmacologic measures, such as aromatherapy, may be effective for PONV prevention and treatment (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1318">Asay, Olson, Donnelly, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Aromatherapy inhalers with ginger, lavender, spearmint, and peppermint are a complementary, homeopathic, and a nonpharmacologic option (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1319">de la Vega, Gilliand, Martinez, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Risk factors for PONV are female gender, age less than 50 years, history of nausea or vomiting after previous anesthesia, and opioid administration (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1322">Finch, Parkosewich, Perrone, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Surgical risks are increased with PONV due to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, elevated central venous pressure, the potential for aspiration, increased heart rate, and systemic blood pressure, which increase the risk of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. Aside from PONV as an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience, it may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, airway compromise, stress on suture lines or incision dehiscence, esophageal tears, hypotension, and increased length of stay in the recovery room (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1318">Asay et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). <a href="#ct16-2">Chart&#x00A0;16-2</a> contains a Nursing Research Profile about PONV.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The older patient, like all patients, is transferred from the OR table to the bed or stretcher slowly and gently. The effects of this action on blood pressure and ventilation are monitored. Special attention is given to keeping the patient warm, because older adults are more susceptible to hypothermia. The patient&#x2019;s position is changed frequently to stimulate respirations as well as promote circulation and comfort.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>An Investigation of PONV in Ambulatory Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Finch, C., Parkosewich, J. A., Perrone, D., et&#x00A0;al. (2019). Incidence, timing, and factors associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting in the ambulatory surgery setting. <em>Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>34</em>(6), 1146&#x2013;1155.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major concern for patients having surgery under general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence, timing, and factors associated with PONV in an ambulatory surgery PACU.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study used a prospective descriptive correlational, cross-sectional design. A random sample of 139 patients admitted to a 10-bed ambulatory PACU participated.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The mean age of participants was 50 years and 70% were female. Only 3 participants had nausea upon arrival to the PACU, but this number increased to 10 by 90 minutes in the PACU, and then went back down to 3 at 150 minutes in the PACU. A total of 4 participants vomited after reporting nausea. Participants with nausea had more hydration and longer PACU stays. Younger age and the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were significantly associated with nausea.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses working with postoperative patients should be aware that PONV can and does occur in both ambulatory and inpatient surgery settings. Nurses should take the age of patients into consideration with anticipating PONV. This study provides evidence that a history of GERD may be a risk factor and thus should be included in preoperative assessment.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediate postoperative care for the older adult is the same as for any surgical patient; however, additional support is given if cardiovascular, pulmonary, or renal function is impaired. With careful monitoring, it is possible to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page442" title="442"></span>detect cardiopulmonary deficits before signs and symptoms are apparent. Changes associated with the aging process, the prevalence of chronic diseases, alteration in fluid and nutrition status, and the increased use of medications result in the need for postoperative vigilance. Nurses should keep in mind that older adults may have slower recovery from anesthesia due to the prolonged time it takes to eliminate sedatives and anesthetic agents. Thermoregulation is important to maintain immune function, adequate pain relief, and tissue oxygenation. Special care to maintain normothermia can minimize the risk of postoperative ischemia and angina in older patients (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative confusion and delirium may occur in up to half of all older adult patients. Signs and symptoms include cognitive deficits, hallucinations, and fluctuating state of consciousness. It is important for the nurse to verify the preoperative psychological assessment as it can help differentiate between postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative delirium. With both conditions, patients exhibit signs of cognitive impairment; however, POCD is of sudden onset in the postsurgical period and is associated with the use of several anesthetic agents (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Alalawi &#x0026; Yasmeen, 2018</a>). Providing adequate hydration, reorienting to the environment, and reassessing the doses of sedative, anesthetic, and analgesic agents may reduce the risk of confusion. Hypoxia can present as confusion and restlessness, as can blood loss and electrolyte imbalances. Exclusion of all other causes of confusion must precede the assumption that confusion is related to age, circumstances, and medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Maintaining a safe environment for older adults requires alertness and planning. Arthritis is a common condition among older patients, and it affects mobility, creating difficulty turning from one side to the other or ambulating without discomfort. The nurse provides mobility support and is vigilant for patients with an increased risk for falls. Fall prevention methods include using a fall risk identification method, providing assistance with ambulation, and allowing legs to dangle off of the stretcher prior to standing (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1320">DeSilva, Seabra, Thomas, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Bariatric Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with obesity are seen in the PACU for a wide variety of conditions, including bariatric and nonbariatric procedures (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1334">Tjeertes, Hoeks, Beks, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Properly sized blood pressure cuffs, gowns, transfer devices, and wheelchairs may be needed for the recovery and transitioning care of these patients. Patients with obesity have unique postoperative risks including an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolus (PE).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with obesity are at particular risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the postoperative period. A direct correlation exists between the incidence of pulmonary complications and the degree of obesity. The mortality rate after upper abdominal operations in patients with severe obesity is 2.5 times that of their normal weight counterparts (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). As discussed in <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, careful preoperative assessment for OSA should occur in patients with obesity in order to detect and manage the manifestations that may occur during the surgical stay. A combination of pulse oximetry and capnography should be utilized when patients are on supplemental oxygen therapy as respiratory depression may be masked when measured only by pulse oximetry (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1326">Jungquist, Card, Charchaflieh, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Research suggests that the combination of continuous monitoring tools alerts PACU nurses to respiratory changes allowing for timely interventions (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1338">Wortham, Rice, Gupta, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Patients with OSA, many of whom also have obesity, are prone to hypoventilation and airway obstruction (ASPAN, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Determining Readiness for Postanesthesia Care Unit Discharge</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A patient remains in the PACU until fully recovered from the anesthetic agent. Indicators of recovery include stable blood pressure, adequate respiratory function, and adequate oxygen saturation level compared with baseline.</p>
<p class="indent">The Aldrete score is used to determine the patient&#x2019;s general condition and readiness for transfer from the PACU (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1315">Aldrete &#x0026; Wright, 1992</a>). Throughout the recovery period, the patient&#x2019;s physical signs are observed and evaluated by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page443" title="443"></span>means of a scoring system based on a set of objective criteria. This evaluation guide allows an objective assessment of the patient&#x2019;s condition in the PACU (see <a href="#ff16-3">Fig.&#x00A0;16-3</a>). The patient is assessed at regular intervals, and a total score is calculated and recorded on the assessment record. The Aldrete score is usually between 7 and 10 before discharge from the PACU. The unit policy and the established PACU discharge criteria determine appropriate postanesthesia recovery score parameters. Scores or conditions lower than the preestablished level necessitate evaluation by the anesthesia provider or surgeon and can result in an extension of the PACU stay or possible disposition to a special care or critical care unit (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1343">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The patient is discharged from the phase I PACU by the anesthesiologist or CRNA to the critical care unit, the medical-surgical unit, or the phase II PACU.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 443</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page444" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="444">p. 444</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s517">Preparing the Postoperative Patient for Direct Discharge</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ambulatory surgical centers frequently have a step-down PACU similar to a phase II PACU. Patients seen in this type of unit are usually healthy, and the plan is to discharge them directly to home. Prior to discharge, the patient will require verbal and written instructions and information about follow-up care.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure patient safety and recovery, expert patient education and discharge planning are necessary when a patient undergoes same-day or ambulatory surgery (<a href="c16-sec02.xhtml#bib1306">Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses [AORN], 2019</a>; ASPAN, 2019). Because anesthetics cloud memory for concurrent events, verbal and written instructions should be given to both the patient and the adult who will be accompanying the patient home. Alternative formats (e.g., large print, Braille) of instructions or the use of a sign language interpreter may be required to ensure patient and family understanding. A translator may be required if the patient and family members do not understand English.</p>
<p class="h7">Discharge Preparation</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient and caregiver (e.g., family member, friend) are informed about expected outcomes and immediate postoperative changes anticipated (AORN, 2019; ASPAN, 2019). <a href="#ct16-3">Chart&#x00A0;16-3</a> identifies important educational points; before discharging the patient, the nurse provides written instructions covering each of those points. Prescriptions are given to the patient. Contact information for the hospital and surgeon&#x2019;s office are provided, and the patient and caregiver are encouraged to call with questions and to schedule follow-up appointments. A list of possible complications and how to manage them (e.g., call the surgeon&#x2019;s office, report to the emergency department [ED]), including elevated temperature, bleeding, and wound care instructions, are key focal points during discharge education.</p>
<p class="indent">Although recovery time varies depending on the type and extent of surgery and the patient&#x2019;s overall condition, instructions usually advise limited activity for 24 to 48 hours. During this time, the patient should not drive a vehicle, drink alcoholic beverages, or perform tasks that require high levels of energy or skill. Fluids may be consumed as desired and smaller than normal amounts may be eaten at mealtime. Patients are cautioned not to make important decisions at this time because the medications, anesthesia, and surgery may affect their decision-making ability. Follow-up phone calls from the nurse are also used to assess the patient&#x2019;s progress and to answer any questions.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Although most patients who undergo ambulatory surgery recover quickly and without complications, some patients require referral for some type of continuing or transitional care. These may be older or frail patients, those who live alone, and patients with other health care problems or disabilities that might interfere with self-care or resumption of usual activities. The home, community, or transitional care nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical status (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular status, adequacy of pain management, the surgical incision, surgical complications) and the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to adhere to the recommendations given at the time of discharge. Previous education is reinforced as needed. Nursing interventions may include changing surgical dressings, monitoring the patency of a drainage system, or administering medications. The patient and family are reminded about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with the surgeon.</p>
