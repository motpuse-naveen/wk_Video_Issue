<h4 class="h4" id="s650">Lung Abscess</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A lung abscess is a localized collection of pus caused by microbial infection (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kamangar, 2018</a>). It is generally caused by aspiration of anaerobic bacteria. By definition, in a lung abscess, the chest x-ray demonstrates a cavity of at least 2 cm. Patients who are at risk for aspiration of foreign material and development of a lung abscess include those with impaired cough reflexes who cannot close the glottis and those with swallowing difficulties. Other patients at risk include those with central nervous system disorders (e.g., seizure, stroke), substance use disorder, esophageal disease, or compromised immune function; patients without teeth and those receiving nasogastric tube feedings; and patients with an altered state of consciousness due to anesthesia (Bartlett, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s651">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most lung abscesses are a complication of bacterial pneumonia or are caused by aspiration of oral anaerobes into the lung. Abscesses also may occur secondary to mechanical or functional obstruction of the bronchi by a tumor, foreign body, or bronchial stenosis, or from necrotizing pneumonias, TB, pulmonary embolism (PE), or chest trauma.</p>
<p class="indent">Most lung abscesses are found in areas of the lung that may be affected by aspiration. The site of the lung abscess is related to gravity and is determined by position. For patients who are confined to bed, the posterior segment of an upper lobe and the superior segment of the lower lobe are the most common areas. However, atypical presentations may occur, depending on the position of the patient when the aspiration occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, the cavity in the lung may or may not extend directly into a bronchus. Eventually, the abscess becomes surrounded, or encapsulated, by a wall of fibrous tissue. The necrotic process may extend until it reaches the lumen of a bronchus or the pleural space and establishes communication with the respiratory tract, the pleural cavity, or both. If the bronchus is involved, the purulent contents are expectorated continuously in the form of sputum. If the pleura is involved, the result is an empyema. A communication or connection between the bronchus and pleura is known as a bronchopleural fistula. The organisms frequently associated with lung abscesses are anaerobic; however, aerobic organisms may be involved as well. The organisms vary depending on the underlying predisposing factors (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kamangar, 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s652">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical manifestations of a lung abscess may vary from a mild productive cough to acute illness. Most patients have a fever and a productive cough with moderate to copious amounts of foul-smelling, sometimes bloody, sputum. The fever and cough may develop insidiously and may have been present for several weeks before diagnosis. Leukocytosis may be present. Pleurisy or dull chest pain, dyspnea, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss are common.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s653">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Physical examination of the chest may reveal dullness on percussion and decreased or absent breath sounds with an intermittent <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pleural friction rub:&lt;/b&gt; localized grating or creaking sound caused by the rubbing together of inflamed parietal and visceral pleurae">pleural friction rub</button></strong> (grating or creaking sound) on auscultation. Crackles may be present. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by chest x-ray, sputum culture, and, in some cases, fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The chest x-ray reveals an infiltrate with an air&#x2013;fluid level. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest may be required to provide more detailed images of different cross-sectional areas of the lung.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s654">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The following measures reduce the risk of lung abscess:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Appropriate antibiotic therapy before any dental procedures in patients who must have teeth extracted while their gums and teeth are infected</span></li>
<li><span>Adequate dental and oral hygiene, because anaerobic bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of lung abscess</span></li>
<li><span>Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for patients with pneumonia</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s655">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The findings of the history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and sputum culture indicate the type of organism and the treatment required. Adequate drainage of the lung abscess may be achieved through postural drainage and chest physiotherapy. Patients should be assessed for an adequate cough. Some patients require insertion of a percutaneous chest catheter for long-term drainage of the abscess. Therapeutic use of bronchoscopy to drain an abscess is uncommon. A diet high in protein and calories is necessary, because chronic infection is associated with a catabolic state, necessitating increased intake of calories and protein to facilitate healing. Surgical intervention is rare, but pulmonary resection (lobectomy) is performed if massive hemoptysis occurs or if there is little or no response to medical management.</p>
<p class="indent">IV antimicrobial therapy depends on the results of the sputum culture and sensitivity and is given for an extended period. Standard treatment of an anaerobic lung infection is clindamycin, ampicillin-sulbactam, or carbapenem (Bartlett, 2019b). Large IV doses are usually required, because the antibiotic must penetrate the necrotic tissue and the fluid in the abscess. The duration of treatment with IV antibiotics is not well studied and remains controversial (Bartlett, 2019b). Treatment with IV antibiotics may continue for 3 weeks and longer, depending upon the clinical severity and organism involved. Improvement is demonstrated by normal temperature, decreased white blood cell count, and improvement on chest x-ray (resolution of surrounding infiltrate, reduction in cavity size, and absence of fluid). Once improvement is demonstrated, IV antibiotics are discontinued and oral administration of antibiotic therapy is continued for an additional 4 to 12 weeks and sometimes longer. If treatment is stopped too soon, a relapse may occur (Bartlett, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s656">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse administers antibiotics and IV treatments as prescribed and monitors for adverse effects. CPT is initiated as prescribed to facilitate drainage of the abscess. The patient is educated on how to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises to help expand the lungs. To ensure proper nutritional intake, the nurse encourages a diet that is high in protein and calories. The nurse also offers emotional support, because the abscess may take a long time to resolve.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A patient who has had surgery may return home before the wound closes entirely or with a drain or tube in place. In these cases, the nurse educates the patient or caregivers about how to change the dressings to prevent skin excoriation and odor, how to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, and how to care for and maintain the drain or tube. The nurse also reminds the patient to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises every 2 hours during the day and shows caregivers how to perform chest percussion and postural drainage to facilitate expectoration of lung secretions.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A patient whose condition requires therapy at home may need referral for home, transitional, or community-based care. During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical condition, nutritional status, and home environment, as well as the ability of the patient and family to carry out the therapeutic regimen. Patient education is reinforced, and nutritional counseling is provided with the goal of attaining and maintaining an optimal state of nutrition. To prevent relapses, the nurse emphasizes the importance of completing the antibiotic regimen and of following suggestions for rest and appropriate activity. If IV antibiotic therapy is to continue at home, the services of home health nurses may be arranged to initiate IV therapy and to evaluate its administration by the patient or family.</p>
<p class="indent">Although most outpatient IV therapy is given in the home setting, the patient may visit a nearby clinic or provider&#x2019;s office for this treatment. In some cases, patients with lung abscess may have ignored their health. Therefore, the nurse should use this opportunity to address health promotion strategies and health screening with the patient.</p>
