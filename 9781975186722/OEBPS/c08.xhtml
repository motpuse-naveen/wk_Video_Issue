<p class="nonindent">Aging, the normal process of time-related change, begins with birth and continues throughout life. Americans are living longer than any previous generation. With the baby boomers turning 65 years of age beginning in 2010, older Americans are the most rapidly expanding portion of the population. In 2016, 3.5 million people celebrated their 65th birthdays. It is projected that 10,000 older adults will celebrate their 65th birthday each year until the year 2030 (<a href="c08-sec04.xhtml#bib549">Administration on Aging [AoA], 2020</a>). Whenever nurses work with adults, they are likely to encounter older adult patients. This chapter presents demographics of aging, normal age-related changes, health problems associated with aging, and ways that nurses can influence the quality of life and address the health issues of older adults.</p>
