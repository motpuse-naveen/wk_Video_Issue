<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mastalgia:&lt;/b&gt; breast pain, usually related to hormonal fluctuations or irritation of a nerve">Mastalgia</button></strong> (breast pain) may be cyclical or noncyclical. Cyclical pain is usually related to hormonal fluctuations, usually during the menstrual cycle, and accounts for the majority of complaints. Noncyclical pain is far less common and does not vary with the menstrual cycle. Women who experience injury or trauma to the breast or those who have had a breast biopsy may experience noncyclical pain. Patients should be reassured that breast pain is rarely indicative of cancer. However, if the pain persists after menses begin, the patient should see her primary provider.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2443">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse may recommend that the patient wear a supportive bra both day and night for a week, avoiding the use of underwire bras, decrease her salt and caffeine intake, and take ibuprofen as needed for its anti-inflammatory actions. Vitamin E supplements may also be helpful.</p>
