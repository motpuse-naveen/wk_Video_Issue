<p class="nonindent">DKA is caused by an absence or markedly inadequate amount of insulin. This deficit in available insulin results in disorders in the metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The three main clinical features of DKA are as follows:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Hyperglycemia</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Dehydration and electrolyte loss</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Acidosis</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2038">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Without insulin, the amount of glucose entering the cells is reduced, and gluconeogenesis (the production and release of glucose by the liver) is increased, leading to hyperglycemia (see <a href="#ff46-6">Fig. 46-6</a>). In an attempt to rid the body of the excess glucose, the kidneys excrete the glucose along with water and electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium). This osmotic diuresis, which is characterized by polyuria, leads to dehydration and marked electrolyte loss (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). Patients with severe DKA may lose up to 6.5 L of water and up to 400 to 500&#x00A0;mEq each of sodium, potassium, and chloride over a 24-hour period.</p>
<p class="indent">Another effect of insulin deficiency or deficit is lipolysis, the breakdown of fat into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies by the liver. Ketone bodies are acids; their accumulation in the circulation due to lack of insulin leads to metabolic acidosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Three main causes of DKA are decreased or missed dose of insulin, illness or infection, and undiagnosed and untreated diabetes (DKA may be the initial manifestation of type 1 diabetes). An insulin deficiency may result from an insufficient dosage of insulin prescribed or from insufficient insulin being given by the patient. Errors in insulin dosage may be made by patients who are ill and who assume that if they are eating less or if they are vomiting, they must decrease their insulin doses. (Because illness, especially infections, can cause increased blood glucose levels, the patient does not need to decrease the insulin dose to compensate for decreased food intake when ill and may even need to increase the insulin dose.)</p>

<p class="indent">Other potential causes of decreased insulin include patient error in drawing up or injecting insulin (especially in patients with visual impairments), intentional skipping of insulin doses (especially in adolescents with diabetes who are having difficulty coping with diabetes or other aspects of their lives), or equipment problems (e.g., occlusion of insulin pump tubing). Illness and infections are associated with insulin resistance. In response to physical (and emotional) stressors, there is an increase in the level of &#x201C;stress&#x201D; hormones&#x2014;glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone. These hormones promote glucose production by the liver and interfere with glucose utilization by muscle and fat tissue, counteracting the effect of insulin. If insulin levels are not increased during times of illness and infection, hyperglycemia may progress to DKA (ADA, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2039">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For prevention of DKA related to illness, &#x201C;sick day rules&#x201D; for managing diabetes when ill (see <a href="#ct46-9">Chart 46-9</a>) should be reviewed with patients. The most important concept in this is to never eliminate insulin doses when nausea and vomiting occur. Instead, the patient should take the usual insulin dose (or previously prescribed special sick day doses) and then attempt to consume frequent small portions of carbohydrates (including foods usually avoided, such as juices, regular sodas, and gelatin). Drinking fluids every hour is important to prevent dehydration. Blood glucose and urine ketones must be assessed every 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p class="indent">If <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1515" title="1515"></span>the patient cannot take fluids without vomiting, or if elevated glucose or ketone levels persist, the provider must be contacted. Patients are taught to have foods available for use on sick days (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Down, 2018</a>). In addition, a supply of urine test strips (for ketone testing) and blood glucose test strips should be available. The patient must know how to contact their primary provider 24 hours a day. These materials should be assembled in a &#x201C;sick day&#x201D; kit.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong><strong>Guidelines to Follow During Periods of Illness (&#x201C;Sick Day Rules&#x201D;)</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take insulin or oral antidiabetic agents as usual.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Test blood glucose and urine ketones every 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Report elevated glucose levels as specified or urine ketones to your primary provider.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take supplemental doses of regular insulin every 3 to 4 hours, if needed, if you take insulin.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Substitute soft foods (e.g., 1/3 cup regular gelatin, 1 cup cream soup, &#x00BD; cup custard, 3 squares graham crackers) six to eight times a day if you cannot follow your usual meal plan.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take liquids (e.g., &#x00BD; cup regular cola or orange juice, &#x00BD; cup broth, 1 cup sports drink [Gatorade]) every &#x00BD; to 1 hour to prevent dehydration and to provide calories, if vomiting, diarrhea, or fever persists.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Report nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to your primary provider, because extreme fluid loss may be dangerous.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that if you are unable to retain oral fluids, you may require hospitalization to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis and possibly coma.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">After the acute phase of DKA has resolved, the nurse should assess for underlying causes. If there are psychological reasons for the patient missing insulin doses, the patient and family may be referred for evaluation and counseling or therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2040">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The hyperglycemia of DKA leads to polyuria, polydipsia, and marked fatigue. In addition, the patient may experience blurred vision, weakness, and headache. Patients with marked intravascular volume depletion may have orthostatic hypotension (drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more on changing from a reclining to a standing position). Volume depletion may also lead to frank hypotension with a weak, rapid pulse.</p>
<p class="indent">The ketosis and acidosis of DKA lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient may have acetone breath (a fruity odor), which occurs with elevated ketone levels. In addition, hyperventilation (with very deep, but not labored, respirations) may occur. These Kussmaul respirations represent the body&#x2019;s attempt to decrease the acidosis, counteracting the effect of the ketone buildup (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Norris, 2019</a>). In addition, mental status in DKA varies widely. The patient may be alert, lethargic, or comatose.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2041">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood glucose levels may vary between 250 and 800 mg/dL (16.6 and 44.4 mmol/L). Some patients have lower glucose values, and others have values of 1000 mg/dL (55.5 mmol/L) or higher (usually depending on the degree of dehydration). The severity of DKA is not necessarily related to the blood glucose level. Evidence of ketoacidosis is reflected in low serum bicarbonate (0 to 15 mEq/L) and low pH (6.8 to 7.3) values. A low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub> 10 to 30 mm Hg) reflects respiratory compensation (Kussmaul respirations) for the metabolic acidosis. Accumulation of ketone bodies (which precipitates the acidosis) is reflected in blood and urine ketone measurements (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Down, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium and potassium concentrations may be low, normal, or high, depending on the amount of dehydration present. Despite the plasma concentration, there has been a marked total body depletion of these (and other) electrolytes, and they will need to be replaced. Increased levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hematocrit may also be seen with dehydration. After rehydration, continued elevation in the serum creatinine and BUN levels suggests underlying renal insufficiency.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2042">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to treating hyperglycemia, management of DKA is aimed at correcting dehydration, electrolyte loss, and acidosis before correcting the hyperglycemia with insulin (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3459">Joyner Blair, Hamilton, &#x0026; Spurlock, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Rehydration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In dehydrated patients, rehydration is important for maintaining tissue perfusion. In addition, fluid replacement enhances the excretion of excessive glucose by the kidneys. The patient may need as much as 6 to 10 L of IV fluid to replace fluid losses caused by polyuria, hyperventilation, diarrhea, and vomiting.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline [NS]) solution is given at a rapid rate, usually 0.5 to 1 L per hour for the first 2 to 4 hours (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>). Half-strength NS (0.45%) solution (also known as hypotonic saline solution) may be used for patients with hypertension or hypernatremia and those at risk for heart failure. After the first few hours, half-strength NS solution is the fluid of choice for continued rehydration, provided the blood pressure is stable and the sodium level is not low. Moderate to high rates of infusion (200 to 500 mL per hour) may be needed for several more hours. When the blood glucose level reaches 300 mg/dL (16.6&#x00A0;mmol/L) or less, the IV solution may be changed to dextrose 5% in water (D<sub>5</sub>W) to prevent a precipitous decline in the blood glucose level (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Monitoring of fluid volume status involves frequent measurements of vital signs (including monitoring for orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate), lung assessment, and monitoring of intake and output. Initial urine output lags behind IV fluid intake as dehydration is corrected. Plasma expanders may be necessary to correct severe hypotension that does not respond to IV fluid treatment. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload is especially important for patients who are older, have renal impairment, or are at risk for heart failure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Restoring Electrolytes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The major electrolyte of concern during treatment of DKA is potassium. The initial plasma concentration of potassium may be low, normal, or high, but more often than not, tends to be high (hyperkalemia) from disruption of the cellular sodium-potassium pump (in the face of acidosis). Therefore, the serum potassium level must be monitored frequently. Some of the factors related to treating DKA that affect potassium concentration include rehydration, which leads to increased plasma volume and subsequent decreases in the concentration of serum potassium. Rehydration also leads to increased urinary excretion of potassium. Insulin administration enhances the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Cautious but timely potassium replacement is vital to avoid arrhythmias that may occur with hypokalemia. As much as 40&#x00A0;mEq/ h may be needed for several hours. Because extracellular potassium levels decrease during DKA treatment, potassium must be infused even if the plasma potassium level is normal.</p>
<p class="indent">Frequent (every 2 to 4 hours initially) ECGs and laboratory measurements of potassium are necessary during the first 8 hours of treatment. Potassium replacement is withheld only if hyperkalemia is present or if the patient is not urinating.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Reversing Acidosis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ketone bodies (acids) accumulate as a result of fat breakdown. The acidosis that occurs in DKA is reversed with insulin, which inhibits fat breakdown, thereby ending ketone production and acid buildup. Insulin is usually infused IV at a slow, continuous rate (e.g., 5 units per hour). Hourly blood glucose values must be measured. IV fluid solutions with higher concentrations of glucose, such as NS solution (e.g., D<sub>5</sub>NS, D<sub>5</sub> 0.45% NS), are given when blood glucose levels reach 250 to 300 mg/dL (13.9 to 16.6 mmol/L) to avoid too rapid a drop in the blood glucose level (i.e., hypoglycemia) during treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Regular insulin, the only type of insulin approved for IV use, may be added to IV solutions. The nurse must convert hourly rates of insulin infusion (frequently prescribed as units per hour) to IV drip rates. For example, if 100 units of regular insulin are mixed into 500 mL of 0.9% NS, then 1 unit of insulin equals 5 mL; therefore, an initial insulin infusion rate of 5 units per hour would equal 25 mL per hour. The insulin is often infused separately from the rehydration solutions to allow frequent changes in the rate and content of the latter (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Insulin must be infused continuously until subcutaneous administration of insulin can be resumed. Any interruption in administration may result in the reaccumulation of ketone bodies and worsening acidosis. Even if blood glucose levels are decreasing and returning to normal, the insulin drip must not be stopped until subcutaneous insulin therapy has been started. Rather, the rate or concentration of the dextrose infusion may be increased to prevent hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels are usually corrected before the acidosis is corrected. Therefore, IV insulin may be continued for 12 to 24 hours, until the serum bicarbonate level increases (to at least 15 to 18 mEq/L) and until the patient can eat. In general, bicarbonate infusion to correct severe acidosis is avoided during treatment of DKA because it precipitates further, sudden (and potentially fatal) decreases in serum potassium levels. Continuous insulin infusion is usually sufficient for reversal of DKA (<a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Down, 2018</a>; <a href="c46-sec12.xhtml#bib3477">Fayfman et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When hanging the insulin drip, the nurse must flush the insulin solution through the entire IV infusion set and discard the first 50 mL of fluid. Insulin molecules adhere to the inner surface of plastic IV infusion sets; therefore, the initial fluid may contain a decreased concentration of insulin.</em></p></div>
