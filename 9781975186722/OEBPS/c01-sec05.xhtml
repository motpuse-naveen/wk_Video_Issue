<h4 class="h4" id="s14">The Practice of Nursing</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As scientific advances in health care technology continue to evolve, nurses face increasingly complex issues and situations. Greater acuity of patients in both hospital and community settings, an aging population, complex disease processes, and end-of-life concerns, as well as ethical issues and cultural factors must be considered. The decision making component of nurses&#x2019; problem-solving activities has become increasingly multifaceted and requires critical thinking based upon sound ethical principles.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s15">Critical Thinking</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;critical thinking:&lt;/b&gt; a cognitive process that utilizes thinking that is purposeful, insightful, reflective, and goal directed to develop conclusions, solutions, and alternatives that are appropriate to the given solution">Critical thinking</button></strong> is a cognitive process that utilizes thinking that is purposeful, insightful, reflective, and goal directed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page11" title="11"></span>in order to develop conclusions, solutions, and alternatives that are appropriate for the given situation. Critical thinking, which includes reasoning and judgment, is based upon a body of knowledge and includes analysis of all information and ideas. Critical thinking leads to the formulation of conclusions and alternatives that are the most appropriate for the situation and is used to plan patient-centered care. Critical thinking has been identified as an essential core competency for nurses by the National League for Nursing (NLN) and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN, 2008; NLN, 2012). This cognitive process is critical to effective use of the nursing process and clinical reasoning (Flanders, Gunn, Wheeler, et al., 2017).</p>
<p class="indent">Critical thinking includes metacognition&#x2014;the examination of one&#x2019;s own reasoning or thought processes&#x2014;to help refine thinking skills. Independent nursing judgments and decisions evolve from a sound knowledge base and the ability to synthesize information within the context in which it is presented. Nursing practice in today&#x2019;s society requires the use of high-level critical thinking skills. Critical thinking enhances clinical decision making, helping to identify patient needs and the best nursing actions that will assist patients in meeting those needs. Because critical thinking is a deliberate, outcome-oriented activity, it is logical, organized, and iterative. &#x201C;In nursing, critical thinking is the ability to think systematically and reflect on the reasoning process used to ensure safe nursing practice&#x201D; (Zarifsanaiey, Amini, &#x0026; Saadat, 2016, p. 2). The process of critical thinking gives nurses the tools to make sound decisions and implement quality nursing care.</p>
<p class="indent">Critical thinkers are inquisitive truth seekers who are open to the alternative solutions that might surface. Critical thinking&#x00A0;is influenced by &#x201C;habits of the mind including: confidence, perseverance, inquisitiveness, intuition, flexibility, creativity, intellectual integrity, contextual perspective, open-mindedness and reflection&#x201D; (Griffits, Hines, Maloney, et al., 2017, p. 2832). Clinical reasoning is a thought process that is a specific method of critical thinking. The process of clinical reasoning results in clinical judgment, which is nursing actions. Clinical reasoning is the core of the nursing process (see later discussion) (<a href="#bib91">Alfaro-LeFevre, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The following factors are identified as critical components of clinical reasoning: communication and relationships, educational level, knowledge and ability to use&#x00A0;critical thinking, familiarity with the environment and the context of care, experience and exposure to a variety of situations, as well as professionalism (<a href="#bib91">Griffits et al., 2017</a>). The skills involved in critical thinking are developed over time through effort, practice, and experience.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Rationality and Insight</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Skills needed in critical thinking include interpretation, analysis, inference, explanation, evaluation, self-reflection, and self-regulation. Critical thinking requires strong background knowledge and knowledge of key concepts as well as logical thinking. Nurses use this disciplined process to validate the accuracy of data and the reliability of any assumptions they have made, and they then carefully evaluate the effectiveness of what they have identified as the necessary actions to take. Nurses also evaluate the reliability of sources, being mindful of and questioning inconsistencies. Nurses use interpretation to determine the significance of data that are gathered, analysis to identify patient problems suggested by the data, and inference to draw conclusions. Explanation is the justification of actions or interventions used to address patient problems and to help patients move toward desired outcomes. Evaluation is the process of determining whether outcomes have been or are being met. Self-regulation is the process of examining the care provided and adjusting the interventions as needed. All processes are iterative.</p>
<p class="indent">Critical thinking is also reflective, involving metacognition, active evaluation, and refinement of the thinking process. Metacognition involves reflective thinking as well as awareness of the nursing skills needed for patient-centered care (<a href="#bib91">Alfaro-LeFevre, 2017</a>). Nurses engaged in critical thinking consider the possibility of cultural differences and personal bias when interpreting data and determining appropriate actions (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for further discussion). Critical thinkers must be insightful and have a sense of fairness and integrity; the courage to question personal ethics; and the perseverance to strive continuously to minimize the effects of egocentricity, ethnocentricity, and other biases on the decision making process (<a href="#bib91">Alfaro-LeFevre, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Components of Critical Thinking</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Certain cognitive or mental activities are key components of critical thinking as it relates to nurses. Critical thinkers (<a href="#bib91">Alfaro-LeFevre, 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Identify the priorities that will determine the nurse&#x2019;s plan of patient-centered care.</span></li>
<li><span>Gather pertinent data from the patient&#x2019;s chart and assessments to determine why certain developments have occurred and to determine if additional data are needed to address the situation accurately.</span></li>
<li><span>Validate the information presented to make sure that it is accurate and compare it with any preexisting data. Information should be evidence based.</span></li>
<li><span>Analyze the information to determine its significance and to identify the formation of clusters or patterns that point to certain conclusions.</span></li>
<li><span>Utilize logical thinking, past clinical experiences, theoretical knowledge, and intuitive thinking to assess the status of the patient&#x2019;s condition. Anticipate the patient&#x2019;s needs and outcomes while acknowledging personal bias and cultural influences.</span></li>
<li><span>Maintain a flexible attitude that facilitates thinking and inquiry and consider all possibilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Utilize inductive and deductive reasoning to identify available options and analyze each in terms of its advantages and disadvantages.</span></li>
<li><span>Formulate decisions that reflect creativity and independent decision making.</span></li>
<li><span>Demonstrate personal humility in terms of one&#x2019;s knowledge deficits and willingly seek additional information to assist with decision making.</span></li>
<li><span>Exhibit the courage to seek new, innovative approaches to patient-centered care. Detach their personal viewpoints <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page12" title="12"></span>from situations and look at things objectively, a process called <em>bracketing.</em></span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Critical thinking requires going beyond basic problem solving into a realm of inquisitive exploration, looking for all relevant factors that affect the issue, and being an &#x201C;out-of-the-box&#x201D; thinker. Nurses&#x2019; ongoing quest for &#x201C;best practice&#x201D; clearly demonstrates intellectual integrity, a component of critical thinking.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Critical Thinking and Clinical Reasoning in Nursing Practice</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Critical thinking and decision making are thought to be associated with improved clinical expertise. Critical thinking is the foundation of the process of clinical reasoning and clinical judgment (<a href="#bib91">Alfaro-LeFevre, 2017</a>). Using critical thinking to develop a plan of nursing care requires considering the human factors that might influence the plan. Nurses interact with patients, families, and other health care providers in the process of providing appropriate, individualized nursing care.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses must use critical thinking skills in all practice settings&#x2014;acute care, ambulatory care, extended care, and the home and community&#x2014;and must view each patient situation as unique and dynamic. The unique factors that patients and nurses bring to the health care situation are considered, studied, analyzed, interpreted, and evaluated. Interpretation of the information then allows nurses to focus on those factors that are most relevant and most significant to the clinical situation. Decisions about a nursing plan, priority of actions, and measurable outcomes are developed into an action plan.</p>
<p class="indent">In decision making related to the nursing process, nurses use cognitive and metacognitive skills as well as logical reasoning to set priorities. These skills include systematic and comprehensive assessment, recognition of assumptions, inconsistencies and biases, verification of reliability and accuracy, identification of missing information, distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information, support of the evidence with facts and conclusions, priority setting with timely decision making, determination of patient-specific outcomes, and reassessment of responses and outcomes (<a href="#bib91">Alfaro-LeFevre, 2017</a>). All of these data are examined within the context of a solid knowledge base. For example, Goodrich, Wagner-Johnston, and Delibovi (2017) describe how oncology nurses use critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and decision making skills in identifying and managing complications of novel and complex therapies for cancer treatment when they:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Develop greater knowledge of potential adverse events by examining evidence-based guidelines.</span></li>
<li><span>Partner with the patient and family to better understand how treatments impact activities of daily living, quality of life, and overall symptom burden.</span></li>
<li><span>Distinguish potential complications from expected manifestations associated with the underlying cancer diagnosis.</span></li>
<li><span>Collaborate with interprofessional team members to modify treatment plans based on assessment data.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Because developing the skill of critical thinking involves experiential learning and practice, critical thinking exercises are offered at the end of each chapter as a means of honing the reader&#x2019;s ability to think critically. Some exercises include questions that stimulate the reader to seek information about EBP relative to the clinical situation described, others challenge the reader to identify priority assessments and interventions, while others challenge the reader to describe the role of the nurse as a member of the interprofessional collaborative team, as noted previously. Additional exercises may be found in the study guide that accompanies the text. The questions listed in <a href="#ct1-1">Chart&#x00A0;1-1</a> can serve as a guide in working through the exercises. It is important to remember that each clinical situation is unique and calls for an individualized approach that fits its unique set of circumstances. As critical thinking may require consideration of ethical principles and cultural contexts, these concepts are discussed in this chapter and in <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s16">The Nursing Process</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing process:&lt;/b&gt; a systematic, problem-solving approach for meeting people&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs; components involve assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation">nursing process</button></strong> is a deliberate problem-solving approach for meeting people&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs. Although the steps of the nursing process have been stated in various ways by different writers, the common components cited are assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation (<a href="#bib91">Carpenito, 2017</a>). The ANA&#x2019;s <em>Scope and Standards of Practice</em> (ANA, 2015b) includes an additional component entitled outcome identification, defined as identification of expected outcomes for a plan that is tailored to the patient&#x2019;s needs. The sequence of steps in this process is assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation. For the purposes of this text, the nursing process is based on the traditional five steps and delineates two components in the diagnosis step: nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems. After the diagnoses or problems have been determined, the desired outcomes are often evident. The traditional steps are defined as follows:</p>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span><strong><em>Assessment:</em></strong> The systematic collection of data through interview, observation, and examination to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status as well as any actual or potential health problems. (Analysis of data is included as part of the assessment. Analysis may also be identified as a separate step of the nursing process.)</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span><strong><em>Diagnosis:</em></strong> Identification of the following two types of patient problems:</p>
<p class="BLMFIRST"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><em>Nursing diagnoses:</em></strong> According to Carpenito (2017), &#x201C;Are clinical judgments about individual, family, or community responses to actual or potential health problems/life processes&#x201D; that can be managed by independent nursing interventions (p. 9).</p>
<p class="BLMFIRST"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><em>Collaborative problems:</em></strong> According to Carpenito (2017), &#x201C;Certain physiologic complications that nurses monitor to detect onset or changes in status. Nurses manage collaborative problems using physician- and nurse-prescribed interventions to minimize the complications of the events&#x201D; (p. 9).</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">3.</span><strong><em>Planning:</em></strong> Development of measurable goals and outcomes as well as a plan of care designed to assist <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page13" title="13"></span>the patient in resolving the diagnosed problems and achieving the identified goals and desired outcomes.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>The Inquiring Mind: Critical Thinking in Action</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Throughout the critical thinking process, a continuous flow of questions evolves in the thinker&#x2019;s mind. It is not sufficient to rely solely on the acquisition of knowledge or a set of problem-solving skills; rather, it is the combination of one&#x2019;s application of knowledge, analysis of the situation, synthesis, and evaluation that promotes effective critical thinking inquiry. Although posing questions will vary according to the particular clinical situation, certain general inquiries can serve as a basis for reaching conclusions and determining a course of action.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">When faced with a patient situation, seeking answers to some or all of the following questions may help to determine those actions that are most appropriate:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What relevant assessment information do I need, and how do I interpret this information? What is the most effective way to gather this information? What does this information tell me? What contextual factors must be considered when gathering this information? What are the priority assessments?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have I identified the most important assessments and findings? Does the information I have gathered point to any other problems that I should consider?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have I gathered all of the necessary information (signs and symptoms, laboratory values, medication history, emotional factors, mental status)? Is anything missing?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is there anything that needs to be reported immediately? Do I need to seek additional assistance?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What risks factors are specific to this patient? Which risk factors are of the highest priority? What must I do to minimize these risks?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What possible complications must I anticipate?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What are the most important problems in this situation? Do the patient and the patient&#x2019;s family recognize the same problems?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What are the desired outcomes for this patient? Which have the highest priority? Do the patient and I agree on these points?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What is going to be my first action in this situation? Why is this action a priority?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>How can I construct a plan of care to achieve the goals?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are there any age-related factors involved, and will they require some special approach? Will I need to make some change in the plan of care to take these factors into account?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>How do the family dynamics affect this situation, and will they affect my actions or the plan of care?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are there cultural factors that I must address and consider?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Am I dealing with an ethical issue here? If so, how am I going to resolve it?</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has any nursing research been conducted on this subject? What are the nursing implications of this research for care of this patient? What is the strength of the evidence found from research?</p>

<p class="indent">Dividing the nursing process into distinct steps serves to emphasize the essential nursing actions that must be taken to address the patient&#x2019;s nursing diagnoses and manage any collaborative problems or complications. However, dividing the process into separate steps is artificial: The process functions as an integrated whole, with the steps being interrelated, interdependent, and recurrent (<a href="#ff1-3">Fig.&#x00A0;1-3</a>). <a href="#ct1-2">Chart&#x00A0;1-2</a> presents an overview of the nursing activities involved in applying the nursing process. Note that the use of the nursing process requires critical thinking and consideration of common ethical principles to ensure that a truly comprehensive plan of care is developed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">According to Carpenito (2017), the initial or baseline assessment is a systematic process of collecting predetermined data during the first contact with the patient. Data are gathered through the health history and the physical assessment. In addition, ongoing assessment and monitoring are crucial to remain aware of changing patient needs and the effectiveness of nursing care.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Health History</p>
<p class="nonindent">The health history is conducted to determine a person&#x2019;s state of wellness or illness and is best accomplished as part of a planned interview. The interview is a personal dialogue between a patient and a nurse that is conducted to obtain information. The nurse&#x2019;s approach to the patient largely determines the amount and quality of the information received. To achieve a relationship of mutual trust and respect, the nurse must communicate a sincere interest in the patient. Examples of therapeutic communication techniques are found in <a href="#tt1-2">Table&#x00A0;1-2</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="indent">A health history guide may help in obtaining pertinent information and directing the course of the interview. Various health history formats designed to guide the interview are available; however, they must be adapted to the responses, health problems, and needs of the person (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for more information about the health history).</p>
<p class="h7">Physical Assessment</p>
<p class="nonindent">A physical assessment may be carried out before, during, or after the health history, depending on a patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional status and the immediate priorities of the situation. The purpose of the physical assessment is to identify those aspects of a patient&#x2019;s physical, psychological, and emotional state that indicate a need for nursing care. It requires the use of sight, hearing, touch, and smell as well as appropriate interview skills and techniques. Physical examination techniques, as well as techniques and strategies for assessing behaviors and role changes, are presented in <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> and in the first chapter of each unit of this book, beginning with Unit 4 and continuing through Unit 15.</p>
<p class="h7">Other Components of the Assessment</p>
<p class="nonindent">Additional relevant information should be obtained from the patient&#x2019;s family or significant others, from other members of the health care team, and from the patient&#x2019;s EHR. Depending on the patient&#x2019;s immediate needs, this information may have been completed before the health history and the physical assessment were obtained. A review of a past medical history or records from previous admissions may provide important information for consideration. Whatever the sequence of events, the nurse should use all available sources of pertinent data to complete the nursing assessment.</p>
<p class="h7">Recording the Data</p>
<p class="nonindent">After the health history and physical assessment are completed, the information obtained is recorded in the patient&#x2019;s permanent record. These records are more commonly becoming electronic (i.e., EHRs). The ANA (2009) advocates that when EHRs are used, &#x201C;patients should receive written, easily understood notification of how their health records are used and when their individually identifiable health information is disclosed to third parties&#x201D; (p. 1). It is imperative that the patient&#x2019;s right to privacy and confidentiality are not violated through the use of EHRs. Regardless of whether the record is in a traditional paper format or an EHR, it must provide a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page15" title="15"></span>means of communication among members of the health care team and facilitate coordinated planning and continuity of care (R&#x00E4;s&#x00E4;nen &#x0026; G&#x00FC;nther, 2019). The record fulfills other functions as well:</p>

<h6 class="h6">Diagnosis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The assessment component of the nursing process serves as the basis for identifying nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems. Soon after the completion of the health history and the physical assessment, nurses organize, analyze, synthesize, and summarize the data collected and determine the patient&#x2019;s need for nursing care.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Diagnoses</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Nursing diagnoses</strong>, the first taxonomy created in nursing, have fostered autonomy and accountability in nursing and have helped to delineate the scope of practice. Many state nurse practice acts include nursing diagnosis as a nursing function, and nursing diagnosis is included in the ANA&#x2019;s <em>Scope and Standards of Practice</em> (2015b) and the standards of nursing specialty organizations. Nursing diagnoses are routinely validated, refined, and updated to reflect current clinical practice and research.</p>
<p class="indent">NANDA International (NANDA-I; formerly known as the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) was the first official organization responsible for developing the taxonomy of nursing diagnoses. In 2000, the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>) was established <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" title="16"></span>as an alternative system to support nursing care and standardization in documentation for practicing nurses at the point of care and across specialties (Coenen, 2003; International Council of Nurses [ICN], 2019). ICNP offers nursing diagnoses, intervention statements, and outcome statements designed to assist nurses within each step of the nursing process and all phases of care and was most recently updated in 2019. The nursing diagnoses used throughout this book are ICNP diagnoses. Because ICNP is proprietary to ICN, which has a global health focus, ICNP terms are spelled using the British method.</p>
<p class="h7">Choosing a Nursing Diagnosis</p>
<p class="nonindent">When identifying a nursing diagnosis for a particular patient, nurses must first identify the commonalities among the assessment data collected. These common features lead to the categorization of related data that reveal the existence of a problem and the need for nursing intervention. The identified problems are then defined as specific nursing diagnoses. Nursing diagnoses represent actual or potential health problems, state of health promotion, or potential risks that can be managed by independent nursing actions.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to remember that nursing diagnoses are not medical diagnoses; they are not medical treatments prescribed by the primary provider, and they are not diagnostic studies. Rather, they are succinct statements of specific patient problems that guide nurses in the development of the plan of nursing care.</p>
<p class="indent">To give additional meaning to the nursing diagnosis, the characteristics and etiology of the problem are identified and included as part of the diagnosis. For example, the nursing diagnoses and their defining characteristics and etiology for a patient who has anemia may include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Activity intolerance associated with imbalance between supply and demand of oxygen</span></li>
<li><span>Impaired peripheral tissue perfusion associated with decreased hemoglobin</span></li>
<li><span>Impaired nutritional status associated with fatigue and inadequate intake of essential nutrients</span></li></ul>
<p class="h7">Collaborative Problems</p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to nursing diagnoses and their related nursing interventions, nursing practice involves certain situations and interventions that do not fall within the definition of nursing diagnoses. These activities pertain to potential problems or complications that are medical in origin and require collaborative interventions with the primary provider and other members of the health care team. The term <em>collaborative problem</em> is used to identify these situations.</p>
<p class="indent">Collaborative problems are certain physiologic complications that nurses monitor to detect changes in the status or onset of complications. Nurses manage collaborative problems using primary provider- and nurse-prescribed interventions to minimize complications (<a href="#bib91">Carpenito, 2017</a>). When treating collaborative problems, the primary nursing focus is monitoring patients for the onset of complications or changes in the status of existing complications. The complications are usually related to the disease process, treatments, medications, or diagnostic studies. The nurse recommends nursing interventions that are appropriate for managing the complications and implements the treatments prescribed by the patient&#x2019;s primary provider. According to Carpenito (2017), collaborative problems do not have patient goals; therefore, the approach to evaluation is different from a nursing diagnosis. The algorithm in <a href="#ff1-4">Figure&#x00A0;1-4</a> depicts the differences between nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems. After the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems have been identified, they are recorded on the plan of nursing care.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Planning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Once the nursing diagnoses have been identified, the planning component of the nursing process begins. This phase involves the following steps:</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 16</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page17" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="17">p. 17</span></div>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span>Assigning priorities to the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span>Specifying realistic and measurable expected outcomes</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">3.</span>Specifying the immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals of nursing action</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">4.</span>Identifying specific nursing interventions appropriate for attaining the outcomes</p>

<p class="NL1Last"><span class="numah">7.</span>Communicating to appropriate personnel any assessment data that point to health care needs that can best be met by other members of the health care team</p>
<p class="h7">Setting Priorities</p>
<p class="nonindent">Assigning priorities to the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems is a joint effort by the nurse and the patient or family members. Any disagreement about priorities is resolved in a way that is mutually acceptable. Consideration must be given to the urgency of the problems, with the most critical problems receiving the highest priority. Maslow Hierarchy of Needs provides one framework to prioritize problems (see previous discussion).</p>
<p class="h7">Establishing Expected Outcomes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Expected outcomes of the nursing interventions, identified either as long term or short term, are written in terms of the patient&#x2019;s behaviors and the time period in which the outcomes are to be met. The outcomes must be attainable and quantifiable (<a href="#bib91">Carpenito, 2017</a>). Resources for identifying appropriate expected outcomes include the ICNP and the standard outcome criteria developed by the Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) (Moorhead, Swanson, Johnson, et al., 2018) (<a href="#ct1-3">Chart&#x00A0;1-3</a>) and by health care agencies for people with specific health problems. These outcomes can be associated with nursing diagnoses and interventions and can be used when appropriate. However, the NOC may need to be adapted to establish realistic criteria for the specific patient involved.</p>
<p class="indent">The expected outcomes that define the patient&#x2019;s desired behavior are used to measure the progress made toward resolving the problem. The expected outcomes also serve as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the nursing interventions and for deciding whether additional nursing care is needed or whether the plan of care needs to be revised.</p>
<p class="h7">Establishing Goals</p>
<p class="nonindent">After the priorities of the nursing diagnoses and expected outcomes have been established, goals (immediate, intermediate, and long term) and the nursing actions appropriate for attaining the goals are identified. The patient and family are included in establishing goals for the nursing actions. Immediate goals are those that can be attained within a short time frame. Intermediate and long-term goals require a longer time frame to be achieved and usually involve preventing complications and other health problems and promoting self-care and rehabilitation. For example, goals for a patient with a nursing diagnosis of impaired mobility associated with pain and edema following total knee replacement may be stated as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Immediate goal: Stands at bedside for 5 minutes 6 to 12 hours after surgery</span></li>
<li><span>Intermediate goal: Ambulates 15 to 20 minutes with walker or crutches in hospital and home</span></li>
<li><span>Long-term goal: Ambulates independently 1 to 2 miles each day</span></li></ul>
<p class="h7">Determining Nursing Actions</p>
<p class="nonindent">In planning appropriate nursing actions to achieve the desired goals and outcomes, the nurse, with input from the patient and significant others, identifies individualized interventions based on the patient&#x2019;s circumstances and preferences that address each outcome. Interventions should identify the activities needed, who will implement them, as well as the frequency. Determination of interdisciplinary activities is made in collaboration with other health care providers as needed. The patient&#x2019;s medications and other prescribed treatments should be integrated into the plan of care to assist the nurse in determining how all interventions contribute to resolution of the identified problems.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse identifies and plans patient education as needed to assist the patient in learning certain self-care activities. Planned interventions should be ethical and appropriate to the patient&#x2019;s culture, age, developmental level, and gender. Standardized interventions, such as those found on standardized care plans, the ICNP, or in the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) (Butcher, Bulechek, Dochterman, et&#x00A0;al., 2018) can be used. <a href="#ct1-4">Chart&#x00A0;1-4</a> describes the NIC system and provides an example of an NIC system intervention. It is important to individualize prewritten interventions to promote optimal effectiveness for each patient. Actions of nurses should be based on established standards.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Implementation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The implementation phase of the nursing process involves carrying out the proposed plan of nursing care. The nurse assumes responsibility for implementation and coordinates the activities of all those involved in implementation, including the patient and family, and other members of the health care team so that the schedule of activities facilitates the patient&#x2019;s recovery. The plan of nursing care serves as the basis for implementation as such:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals are used as a focus for the implementation of the designated nursing interventions.</span></li>
<li><span>While implementing nursing care, the nurse continually assesses the patient and the patient&#x2019;s individual response to the nursing care.</span></li>
<li><span>Revisions are made in the plan of care as the patient&#x2019;s condition, problems, and responses change and when reordering of priorities is required.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Implementation includes direct or indirect execution of the planned interventions. It is focused on resolving the patient&#x2019;s nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems and achieving expected outcomes, thus meeting the patient&#x2019;s health needs. The following are examples of nursing interventions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Supervise the patient performing active range-of-motion exercises three times a day.</span></li></ul>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 17</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page18" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="18">p. 18</span></div>
<div class="box1a">
<p class="BoxpNumber" id="ct1-3"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;1-3</strong></p></div>
<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Nursing Outcomes Classification</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification of patient outcomes that are sensitive to nursing interventions. Each outcome is a neutral statement about a variable patient condition, behavior, or perception, coupled with a rating scale. The outcome statement and scale can be used to identify baseline functioning, expected outcomes, and actual outcomes for individual patients. The following table is an example of a nursing-sensitive outcome.</p>
<div class="figure11"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/18-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-18-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a></figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Teach the patient who is postoperative to use an incentive spirometer 10 times every hour while awake.</span></li>
<li><span>Monitor the patient for adverse effects of opioid analgesic medications, including sedation and respiratory depression.</span></li>
<li><span>Assist the patient in developing a plan to reduce dietary sodium and increase daily activity.</span></li>
<li><span>Administer sublingual nitroglycerin as prescribed to the patient who complains of angina.</span></li>
<li><span>Assess electrolyte levels prior to administering scheduled intravenous diuretics.</span></li></ul>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Nursing Interventions Classification</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is an in-depth, evidence-based taxonomy of interventions that includes independent and collaborative interventions. These interventions are performed in a variety of health care settings. Intervention labels are terms such as <em>bleeding precautions, medication administration,</em> or <em>pain management: acute.</em> Listed under each intervention are multiple discrete nursing actions that together constitute a comprehensive approach to the treatment of a particular condition. Not all actions are applicable to every patient; nursing judgment and critical thinking will determine which actions to implement. The following is an example of a nursing intervention:</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Fluid Resuscitation</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Definition</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Administering prescribed intravenous (IV) fluids rapidly</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Activities</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First">Obtain and maintain a large-bore IV.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Collaborate with primary providers to ensure administration of both crystalloids (e.g., normal saline and lactated Ringer&#x2019;s) and colloids (e.g., Hesban, and Plasmanate), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Administer IV fluids, as prescribed.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Obtain blood specimens for crossmatching, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Administer blood products, as prescribed.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Monitor hemodynamic response.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Monitor oxygen status.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Monitor for fluid overload.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Monitor output of various body fluids (e.g., urine, nasogastric drainage, and chest tube).</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Monitor BUN, creatinine, total protein, and albumin levels.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1Last">Monitor for pulmonary edema and third spacing.</p>

</div>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Check gastric residuals in the patient receiving tube feedings before each feeding.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Clinical judgment, critical thinking, and good decision-making skills are essential in the selection of appropriate evidence-based and ethical nursing interventions. All nursing interventions are patient centered and outcome directed and are implemented with compassion, skill, confidence, and a willingness to accept and understand the patient&#x2019;s responses.</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">Implementation is nursing action. Therefore, statements involving implementation always start with a verb.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Although many nursing actions are independent, others are interdependent, such as carrying out prescribed treatments, administering medications and therapies, and collaborating with other health care team members to accomplish specific expected outcomes and to monitor and manage potential complications. Such interdependent functioning is just that&#x2014;interdependent. Requests or prescriptions from other health care team members should not be followed blindly but must be assessed critically and questioned when necessary. The implementation phase of the nursing process ends when the nursing interventions have been completed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Evaluation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Evaluation, the final step of the nursing process, allows the nurse to determine the patient&#x2019;s response to the nursing interventions and the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. The plan of nursing care is the basis for evaluation. The nursing diagnoses, collaborative problems, priorities, nursing interventions, and expected outcomes provide the specific guidelines that dictate the focus of the evaluation. Through evaluation, the nurse can answer the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Were the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems accurate?</span></li>
<li><span>Did the patient achieve the expected outcomes within the critical time periods?</span></li>
<li><span>Have the patient&#x2019;s nursing diagnoses been resolved?</span></li>
<li><span>Have the collaborative problems been resolved?</span></li>
<li><span>Do priorities need to be reordered?</span></li>
<li><span>Have the patient&#x2019;s nursing needs been met?</span></li>
<li><span>Should the nursing interventions be continued, revised, or discontinued?</span></li>
<li><span>Have new problems evolved for which nursing interventions have not been planned or implemented?</span></li>
<li><span>What factors influenced the achievement or lack of achievement of the objectives?</span></li>
<li><span>Should changes be made to the expected outcomes and outcome criteria?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Objective data that provide answers to these questions are collected from all available sources (e.g., patients, families, significant others, health care team members). These data are included in patients&#x2019; records and must be substantiated by direct patient observation before the outcomes are documented.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Documentation of Outcomes and Revision of the Plan</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Outcomes are documented concisely and objectively. Documentation should relate outcomes to the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems, describe the patient&#x2019;s responses to the interventions, indicate whether the outcomes were met, and include any additional pertinent data. As noted previously, the nurse individualizes a plan of care for each patient&#x2019;s particular circumstances. <a href="#ct1-5">Chart&#x00A0;1-5</a> gives an example of a plan of nursing care that has been developed for a 22-year-old woman admitted to a postoperative surgical unit after having an emergent laparoscopic appendectomy.</p>
<p class="indent">The plan of care is subject to change as a patient&#x2019;s needs change, as the priorities of needs shift, as needs are resolved, and as additional information about a patient&#x2019;s state of health is collected. As the nursing interventions are implemented, the patient&#x2019;s responses are evaluated and documented, and the plan of care is revised accordingly. A well-developed, continuously updated plan of care is the greatest assurance that the patient&#x2019;s nursing diagnoses, and collaborative problems are addressed, and their basic needs are met.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Frameworks for a Common Approach to Nursing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Various frameworks or taxonomies can be used for determining nursing diagnoses, establishing outcomes, designing interventions, and guiding clinical decision making. Ultimately, a framework that uses a language common to all aspects of nursing, regardless of the classification system, is desirable. In 2001, a taxonomy of nursing practice was developed for the harmonization of NANDA-I, NIC, and NOC. This three-part combination links nursing diagnoses, accompanying interventions, and outcomes, organizing them in the same way. Similarly, the ICNP has developed catalogues that align nursing diagnoses, outcome statements, and intervention statements. Such organization of concepts in a common language or taxonomy may facilitate the process of clinical judgment and critical thinking, because interventions and outcomes are more accurately matched with appropriately developed nursing diagnoses (<a href="#bib91">Carpenito, 2017</a>). More recently, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>) developed the NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, which offers a framework to measure clinical decision making and clinical judgment in the context of the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> examination; see <a href="#ct1-6">Chart&#x00A0;1-6</a>). <a href="#ff1-5">Figure&#x00A0;1-5</a> illustrates the application of this model to the nursing process.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s17">Ethical Nursing Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the complex health care world, nurses are faced with numerous ethical issues. Consequently, there has been a heightened interest in the field of ethics in an attempt to gain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page24" title="24"></span>a better understanding of how these issues can be addressed. Specifically, the focus on ethics in health care has intensified in response to controversial developments, including advanced technology, genomics, medical futility, scarcity of resources, and end-of-life issues, to name a few.</p>

<p class="indent">Today, sophisticated technology can prolong life well beyond the time when death would have occurred in the past. Expensive experimental procedures, clinical trials, complex equipment and treatments are available to prolong life, even when such attempts may not provide quality of life. The development of technologic support has influenced the quality and delivery of nursing care at all stages of life and also has contributed to an increase in average life expectancy. For example, robotic technology is helping older adults living in the community to better manage chronic health problems (Bakas, Sampsel, Israel, et al., 2018). Adults with end-stage heart failure who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation can live longer with the support of newer generation left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), which require less invasive surgery and are associated with less complications than older model LVADs (<a href="#bib91">Kubrusly, 2019</a>). Advances in immunotherapy have increased life expectancies for patients diagnosed with advanced stage melanomas and nonsquamous cell lung cancers (<a href="#bib91">Munro, 2019</a>). Patients who would have died of organ failure are living longer because of organ transplantation and stem cell transplant.</p>
<p class="indent">These advances in technology have been a mixed blessing. Questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to use such technology and, if so, under what circumstances. Although many patients do achieve a good quality of life, others face extended suffering as a result of efforts to prolong life, usually at great expense both emotionally and financially. Ethical issues also surround those practices or policies that seem to allocate health care resources unjustly on the basis of age, race, gender, disability, or social mores. Older adults may be at risk for being denied health care because of their advanced age and the bias known as ageism (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> for a further discussion of ageism).</p>
<p class="indent">Ethical dilemmas that nurses may encounter in the medical-surgical nursing arena are diverse and occur in all settings. An awareness of underlying concepts helps nurses use reason to work through these dilemmas. Basic concepts related to moral philosophy, such as ethics and its principles, theories, and approaches, are included in this chapter. Understanding the role of the professional nurse in ethical decision making not only helps nurses articulate their ethical positions and develop the skills needed to make ethical decisions, but also helps them use the nursing process to develop plans of care from an ethical perspective.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ethics versus Morals</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The terms <em>ethics</em> and <em>morality</em> are used to describe beliefs about right and wrong and to suggest appropriate guidelines for action. In essence, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ethics:&lt;/b&gt; the formal, systematic process used to understand, analyze, and evaluate decisions regarding matters of right and wrong as they apply to well-being">ethics</button></strong> is the formal, systematic study of moral beliefs to understand, analyze, and evaluate matters of right and wrong; whereas, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;morality:&lt;/b&gt; specific beliefs or actions whose outcomes are often examined utilizing the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, double effect, and distributive justice">morality</button></strong> includes specific values, characters, or actions whose outcomes are often examined through systematic ethical analysis. Because the distinction between ethics and morality is slight, the terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ethics Theories</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One classic theory in ethics is teleologic theory or consequentialism, which focuses on the ends or consequences of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" title="25"></span>actions. The best-known form of this theory, utilitarianism, is based on the concept of &#x201C;the greatest good for the greatest number.&#x201D; The choice of action is clear under this theory, because the action that maximizes good over bad is the correct one. The theory poses difficulty when one must judge intrinsic values and determine whose good is the greatest. In addition, it is important to ask whether good consequences can justify any amoral actions that might be used to achieve them.</p>

<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct1-7"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;1-7 <img class="m" src="images/icon55.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Common Ethical Principles</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following common ethical principles may be used to validate moral claims.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This word <em>autonomy</em> is derived from the Greek words <em>autos</em> (&#x201C;self&#x201D;) and <em>nomos</em> (&#x201C;rule&#x201D; or &#x201C;law&#x201D;) and therefore refers to self-determination. The principle of autonomy entails the right of patients to receive adequate and accurate information so that they have the ability to make a choice free from external constraints. It is synonymous with self-determination.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Beneficence and Nonmaleficence</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Beneficence is the duty to perform acts that can be of benefit others. It also entails taking positive action to prevent patients from harming themselves or others, including society as a whole. There is also an implied commitment to help people with disability.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Nonmaleficence is the duty to not inflict harm. The only time when it is considered morally permissible to exercise power over a competent person against their will is when by doing so, harm to others is prevented.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Double Effect</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The double effect is a principle that may morally justify some actions that produce both good and evil effects.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">All four of the following criteria must be fulfilled:</p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>The action itself is good or morally neutral.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>The agent sincerely intends the good and not the evil effect (the evil effect may be foreseen but is not intended).</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>The good effect is not achieved by means of the evil effect.</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Distributive Justice</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">From a broad perspective, justice states that like cases should be treated alike. More specifically, distributive justice is an ethical principle commonly applicable to clinical situations. This principle is upheld when benefits and burdens are distributed equitably and fairly without consideration of age, gender, socioeconomic status, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Simply stated, there is an ethical obligation to distribute or allocate resources fairly.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Another theory in ethics is the deontologic or formalist theory, which argues that ethical standards or principles exist independently of the ends or consequences. In a given situation, nurses have a &#x201C;sense of duty&#x201D; to act based on the one relevant principle, or the most relevant of several ethical principles. Their actions must be independent of the ends or consequences. Problems arise with this theory when personal and cultural biases influence the choice of the most primary ethical principle.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Approaches to Ethics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Two approaches to ethics are meta-ethics and applied ethics. An example of meta-ethics (understanding the concepts and linguistic terminology used in ethics) in the health care environment is analysis of the concept of informed consent. Nurses are aware that patients must give consent before surgery; however, sometimes a question arises as to whether a patient is truly informed and mentally competent. Delving more deeply into the concept of informed consent would be a meta-ethical inquiry (see <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> for more information about informed consent before surgery).</p>
<p class="indent">Applied ethics refers to identification of ethical problems relevant to a specific discipline and that discipline&#x2019;s practice. It addresses the implications of actions or practices in terms of their moral permissibility. Various disciplines use the frameworks of general ethical theories and principles and apply them to specific problems within their domain. Nursing ethics may be considered a form of applied ethics because it addresses moral situations that are specific to the nursing profession and patient care. Common ethical principles that can be used to validate moral claims in clinical practice include autonomy, beneficence and nonmaleficence, double effect, and distributive justice. Brief definitions of these important principles can be found in <a href="#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">Moral Situations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many situations exist in which ethical analysis is needed. Some are <strong>moral dilemmas</strong>, or situations in which a clear conflict exists between two or more moral principles or competing moral claims, and nurses must choose the lesser of two evils. Other situations represent <strong>moral problems</strong>, in which there may be competing moral claims or principles, although one claim or principle is clearly dominant. Some situations result in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;moral uncertainty:&lt;/b&gt; internal conflict that arises when the person cannot define what the moral situation is or what moral principles apply but has a strong feeling that something is not right">moral uncertainty</button></strong>, when one cannot accurately define what the moral situation is or what moral principles apply but has a strong feeling that something is not right. Still other situations may result in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;moral distress:&lt;/b&gt; internal response that occurs when a health care provider believes they inherently know the correct ethical action that is needed but cannot act on that knowledge">moral distress</button></strong>, in which one is aware of the correct course of action, but institutional constraints stand in the way of pursuing the correct action. Altaker, Howie-Esquivel, and Cataldo (2018) found that moral distress in critical-care nurses was related to perceptions of a poor ethical climate and poor personal empowerment (see Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct1-8">Chart&#x00A0;1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many scenarios may occur in clinical practice that require an ethical analysis. For example, an older adult patient with a history of advanced dementia and heart failure is admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and diagnosed with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" title="26"></span>aspiration pneumonia. This is the patient&#x2019;s third hospitalization in the last year for aspiration pneumonia. The patient fails a swallow evaluation and the speech-language pathologist recommends that the patient remain NPO (nothing by mouth). The primary provider coordinates a family meeting to discuss options for nutrition which include inserting a percutaneous feeding tube or carefully hand feeding the patient to promote comfort. The team learns that the patient never completed a living will or assigned a health care representative. The patient&#x2019;s son recalls his mother telling him once on a trip to Italy that &#x201C;eating was one of her greatest pleasures.&#x201D; However, the patient&#x2019;s daughter is adamant that her mother receives a feeding tube, despite learning that feeding tubes do not increase survival and are associated with complications in patients with significant cognitive deficits. Both the son and daughter have a close relationship with their mother, but neither have had a formal discussion with her about her end-of-life wishes. They do not have any other siblings and their father died several years ago suddenly from a cerebral aneurysm. The son is reluctant to go against his sister&#x2019;s wishes. The nurse has worked with other patients and families in similar situations and knows that his role is to advocate for his patient. He is familiar with current literature which suggests enteral feedings do not improve nutritional or functional status in this population and feels strongly that a feeding tube will not enhance the patient&#x2019;s quality of life. The primary provider is concerned that the daughter will create &#x201C;problems&#x201D; for the hospital if a feeding tube is not inserted and states that &#x201C;he does not have time to deal with her&#x201D; so schedules the patient for the procedure. The nurse feels strongly that this is the wrong decision and that the daughter would benefit from more education and time to process this complex decision. However, the nurse does not feel empowered to voice his concerns to the primary provider and is left feeling a sense of moral distress; he knows the right course of action, but institutional factors, including existing power hierarchies among nurses and primary providers and lack of time and additional supportive services, prevent him from acting. The nurse wishes that he had had more time to discuss this case with his charge nurse or nurse manager, or to consult the palliative care team which is not in the hospital on the weekends, and today is a Saturday.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Moral Distress in Critical-Care Nurses</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Altaker, K. W., Howie-Esquivel, J., &#x0026; Cataldo, J. K. (2018). Relationships among palliative care, ethical climate, empowerment, and moral distress in intensive care unit nurses. <em>American Journal of Critical Care</em>, <em>27</em>(4), 295&#x2013;302.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Between 10% and 29% of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) die. Difficulty delivering adequate end-of-life comfort care can cause moral distress among nurses who work in ICUs. Delivering quality comfort care can be predicated upon the ability of the critical-care nurses to appropriately access palliative care services. Moral distress may also be affected by the overall ethical climate in the ICU, as well as by the personal sense of empowerment by the individual critical-care nurse. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate relationships between critical-care nurses&#x2019; moral distress, palliative care service access, ICU ethical climate, and personal empowerment.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A Web-based survey was sent to a nationally representative sample of critical-care nurses who belonged to the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. In order to be eligible for the study, participants had to be currently working as a direct provider of nursing care in an adult ICU and had to have provided care to at least one dying patient within the past 6 months. Of those who agreed to participate, 235 completed all survey items. Items included in the survey were derived from psychometrically validated instruments including the Moral Distress Scale-Revised, the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, and the Psychological Empowerment Instrument. In addition, survey items that assessed participants&#x2019; perceptions of access to, use of, and barriers to palliative care in the ICU were developed and included in the survey.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Moral distress was negatively associated with feelings of empowerment (<em>r</em> = &#x2212;0.145; <em>p</em> = 0.02) and with the ICU ethical climate (<em>r</em> = &#x2212;0.354; <em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001). Multiple regression analysis found that the factors that contributed to variance in moral distress included the ICU ethical climate, access to palliative care services, size of the ICU, and personal characteristics of the nurse, such as ethnicity and educational level. The factor that contributed the most to moral distress was the ICU ethical climate, with a positive ICU ethical climate correlating with lower levels of moral distress.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that critical-care nurses who feel less empowered also feel greater moral distress; however, this relationship was not clear when the variable of ICU ethical climate was analyzed. It seems that personal characteristics of the critical-care nurse, including feelings of empowerment, as well as the ethical climate within the ICU, have roles in determining whether the critical-care nurse experiences moral distress. An unexpected finding was that critical-care nurses who reported access to palliative care services reported greater moral distress. The quality of the interprofessional relationships between critical-care nurses and interdisciplinary members of palliative care teams must be explored. Further studies must be conducted to better discern the causes of moral distress among critical-care nurses so that appropriate interventions may be targeted to mitigate moral distress, which can cause nurse burnout and patient care avoidance.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It is essential that nurses freely engage in dialogue concerning moral situations, even though such dialogue is difficult for everyone involved. Improved interdisciplinary collaboration is supported when all members of the health care team can voice their concerns and come to an understanding of the moral situation. Consultation with an ethics committee could be helpful to assist the health care team, patient, and family to identify the moral dilemma and possible approaches to the dilemma (see the Ethics Committees <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" title="27"></span>section). Nurses should be familiar with agency policy supporting patient self-determination and resolution of ethical issues.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Types of Ethical Problems in Nursing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As a profession, nursing is accountable to society. Nursing has identified its standards of accountability through formal codes of ethics that explicitly state the profession&#x2019;s values and goals. The ICN has endorsed a globally applicable <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses</em> (<a href="#bib13">ICN, 2012</a>). Likewise, the ANA established a <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses</em> that includes ethical standards, each with its own interpretive statements (ANA, 2015a). The interpretive statements provide guidance to address and resolve ethical dilemmas by incorporating universal moral principles. In addition, the ANA sponsors a Center for Ethics and Human Rights that contains a repository of position statements that can be used to guide nursing practice (<a href="#ct1-9">Chart&#x00A0;1-9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ethical issues have always affected the role of professional nurses. The accepted definition of professional nursing not only supports the advocacy role for nurses, but also the claim that nurses must be actively involved in the decision making process regarding ethical concerns surrounding health care and human responses. Nurses are morally obligated to present ethical conflicts within a logical, systematic framework. Health care settings in which nurses are valued members of the team promote interdisciplinary communication and may enhance patient care. The nurse presented in the case study in the previous section is morally obligated to address his concerns constructively. He should carve out the time to discuss his concerns within his chain of command, through notifying his charge nurse of his concerns for the patient. To practice effectively in these settings, nurses must be aware of ethical issues and serve as patient advocates to assist patients in asserting their autonomy in decision making.</p>

<p class="indent">Nursing theories that incorporate the biopsychosocial&#x2013;spiritual dimensions emphasize a holistic viewpoint, with humanism or caring at the core. Caring and compassion are often cited as virtues inherent within the moral foundation for professional nursing practice. For nurses to embrace this professional ethos, they must be aware not only of major ethical dilemmas but also of those daily interactions with health care consumers that frequently give rise to less easily identifiable ethical challenges. Although technologic advances and diminished resources have been instrumental in raising numerous ethical questions and controversies, including life-and-death issues, nurses should not ignore the many routine situations that involve ethical considerations. Some of the most common issues faced by nurses today include confidentiality, the use of restraints, truth-telling, refusing to provide care, and end-of-life decisions and palliative care.</p>
<p class="h7">Confidentiality</p>
<p class="nonindent">All nurses should be aware of the confidential nature of information obtained in daily practice. Confidentiality acknowledges and respects each person&#x2019;s privacy. If information is not pertinent, nurses should question whether it is prudent to document it in a patient&#x2019;s record. In the practice setting, discussion of patients with other members of the health care team is often necessary. However, these discussions should occur in a private area where it is unlikely that the conversation will be overheard. Nurses should also be aware that the use of family members or hospital ancillary personnel as interpreters for patients who are not fluent in English language or who are deaf violates patients&#x2019; rights of confidentiality. Translation services should be provided for non&#x2013;English-speaking patients, and interpreters should be provided for those who use sign language by the hospital or institution.</p>
<p class="indent">Another threat to confidentiality is the widespread use of computer-based technologies, particularly EHRs, and people&#x2019;s easy access to them. The growing demand for telehealth innovations and the increasing use of this method can result in unchecked access to health information. In addition, personal and health information is often made available to numerous individuals and corporate stakeholders, which may increase the potential for misuse of health care information. Because of these possibilities of maleficence, sensitivity to the principle of confidentiality is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page28" title="28"></span>essential. The ANA (2015) published a position statement that addresses patients&#x2019; rights to privacy and confidentiality of their health information.</p>
<p class="indent">Federal legislation has been developed to protect the right of confidentiality. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (HHS, 2003), efforts must be made to protect each patient&#x2019;s private health information (PHI), whether it is transmitted by verbal, written, or electronic means of communication. Communication should be confined to the appropriate settings and with appropriate individuals and should occur for the appropriate purposes of facilitating patient care. Violations of protection of any patient&#x2019;s privacy could result in criminal or civil litigation (HHS, 2003).</p>
<p class="h7">Restraints</p>
<p class="nonindent">The use of restraints (including physical and pharmacologic measures) and patient seclusion are additional issues with ethical overtones because of the limits on a person&#x2019;s autonomy and human dignity when these measures are used. Nurses must weigh carefully the risks of limiting autonomy and increasing the risks of injury by using restraints against the risks of injury if not using restraints, which have been documented as resulting in physical harm and death. The ANA (2012) advocates that in situations where restraints and seclusion must be used, all staff must be educated on safety measures. In addition, there must be adequate staff that are vigilant in monitoring their use. These interventions may be utilized only when there is no other viable option available. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;The Joint Commission:&lt;/b&gt; a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals and health care organizations">The Joint Commission</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bundle:&lt;/b&gt; a set of three to five evidence-based practices that, when implemented appropriately, can measurably improve patient outcomes"></button></strong>, a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals and health care organizations, and CMS have designated standards for the use of restraints (see The Joint Commission and CMS Web sites listed in the Resources section).</p>
<p class="h7">Trust Issues</p>
<p class="nonindent">Truth-telling or veracity is one of the basic principles in the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship. Truth-telling is based upon the principle of autonomy; it requires that the nurse understands and supports patient self-determination (<a href="#bib91">Beauchamp &#x0026; Childress, 2019</a>). For example, failure to disclose a diagnosis to a patient deprives the person of the right to make informed decisions. Three ethical dilemmas in clinical practice that can directly conflict with this principle are the use of placebos (nonactive substances used for treatment), not revealing a diagnosis to a patient, and revealing a diagnosis to people other than the patient with the diagnosis. All involve the issue of trust, which is an essential element in the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Placebos may be used in experimental research, in which a patient is involved in the decision making process and is aware that placebos are being used in the treatment regimen. However, the use of a placebo as a substitute for an active drug to show that a patient does not have actual symptoms of a disease is deceptive, has both ethical and legal implications, and severely undermines the nurse&#x2013;patient relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Informing a patient of his or her diagnosis when the family and primary provider have chosen to delay full disclosure of pertinent information is an ethical dilemma that can occur in nursing practice. The nurse may experience moral distress when asked by the patient for a truthful diagnosis. The nurse may use evasive comments with the patient in these situations. This area is indeed complex, because it challenges a nurse&#x2019;s <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;moral integrity:&lt;/b&gt; virtue composed of veracity, fidelity, benevolence, wisdom, and moral courage">moral integrity</button></strong><strong>.</strong> Nurses could consider the following strategies:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Avoid lying to the patient.</span></li>
<li><span>Provide all information related to nursing procedures and diagnoses.</span></li>
<li><span>Act as a patient advocate and communicate the patient&#x2019;s requests for information to the family and primary provider. The family is often unaware of the patient&#x2019;s repeated questions to the nurse. With a better understanding of the situation, the family members may change their perspective.</span></li>
<li><span>Make a referral to the institution&#x2019;s ethics committee.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Although providing the information may be the morally appropriate behavior, the manner in which the patient is told is important. Nurses must be compassionate and caring when informing patients; disclosure of information merely for the sake of patient autonomy does not convey respect for others and in some circumstances may result in emotional distress. Family support or the support of a spiritual advisor (e.g., chaplain) may be needed to reduce the impact of distressing information or a poor prognosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Disclosing the patient&#x2019;s diagnosis to others without the patient&#x2019;s consent is a HIPAA violation and therefore is not only unethical but also illegal. Failure to protect the patient&#x2019;s right to privacy and a breach of confidentiality is unethical.</p>
<p class="h7">Refusing to Provide Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Any nurse who feels morally obliged to refuse to provide care for a particular type of patient faces an ethical dilemma. Reasons for refusal range from a conflict of personal values to a fear that the nurse would place either the patient or self in jeopardy. Feelings related to care of people of different ethnicities or sexual orientation also surface as societal changes emerge. The ethical obligation to care for all patients is clearly identified in the <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses</em> (ANA, 2015a). Accordingly, the nurse must give patient-centered care to all patients, regardless of their socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender expression, ethnicity, or proximity to death. In particular, patients facing end-of-life decisions must receive supportive care, which must be extended to their family and surrogate decision makers (ANA, 2015a).</p>
<p class="h7">End-of-Life Issues</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dilemmas that center on death and dying are prevalent in medical-surgical nursing practice. With the availability of increasingly sophisticated and advanced technology, it may be difficult to accept that nothing more can be done to prolong life or that technology may prolong life but at the expense of the patient&#x2019;s comfort and quality of life. When providing end-of-life care, nurses serve as the patient&#x2019;s advocate and manage pain and suffering. Nurses have the moral obligation to facilitate a patient&#x2019;s right to self-determination. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page29" title="29"></span>Furthermore, nurses should facilitate end-of-life discussions between the patient and the family in order to prevent suffering and preserve the patient&#x2019;s dignity (ANA, 2015a).</p>
<p class="indent">Many people who are terminally ill seek legal options for a peaceful and dignified death. Nurses who deliver palliative care must understand that their actions are targeted at relieving pain and suffering and not hastening death. According to Provision 1.4 of the <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses,</em> &#x201C;The nurse should provide interventions to relieve pain and other symptoms in the dying patient consistent with palliative care practice standards and may not act with the sole intent to end life (2015a, p. 3),&#x201D; even if the intent to end life is motivated by compassion or respect for patient autonomy.</p>
<p class="indent">End-of-life issues shift the focus from curative care to palliative and end-of-life care. Focusing on the caring as well as the curing role may help nurses deal with these difficult moral situations. Needs of patients and families require holistic and interdisciplinary approaches. End-of-life issues that often involve ethical dilemmas include pain control, &#x201C;do not resuscitate&#x201D; (DNR) orders, life support measures, and administration of food and fluids. These issues are discussed in detail in <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventive Ethics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When a nurse is faced with two conflicting alternatives, it is the nurse&#x2019;s moral responsibility to choose the lesser of the two evils. These situations often result in feelings of moral distress in the nurse who is obliged to make a choice.</p>
<p class="h7">Patient Self-Determination</p>
<p class="nonindent">Frequently, dilemmas occur when health care practitioners are unsure of the patient&#x2019;s wishes because the patient is unconscious or mentally incompetent and cannot communicate. The Patient Self-Determination Act, enacted in December 1991, encourages people to prepare advance directives in which they indicate their wishes concerning the degree of supportive care they wish if they become incapacitated. This legislation requires that patients be informed about advance directives by the staff of the health care facility.</p>
<p class="indent">Advance directives are legal documents that specify a person&#x2019;s wishes before hospitalization and provide valuable information that may assist health care providers in decision making. A living will is one type of advance directive. Typically, living wills are limited to situations in which the patient&#x2019;s medical condition is deemed terminal. Because it is difficult to define <em>terminal</em> accurately, living wills are not always honored. Another potential drawback is that living wills are frequently written while people are in good health. It is not unusual for people to change their minds as an illness progresses; therefore, patients retain the option to nullify these documents.</p>
<p class="indent">Identifying a health care representative, in which one person identifies another person to make health care decisions on his or her behalf, is another type of advance directive. It is the responsibility of the health care representative to act as the patient stated in the advance directive. For example, patients may have clarified their wishes concerning various medical situations. If there is no advance directive, the health care representative must act in good faith and make decisions that they believe the patient would make if mentally competent. Laws concerning advance directives vary among state jurisdictions. However, even in states where these documents are not legally binding, they provide helpful information to determine the patient&#x2019;s prior expressed wishes in situations in which this information can no longer be obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Advance directives are limited in scope to hospital and long-term care facility environments. Emergency medical system (EMS) personnel (e.g., paramedics) therefore cannot legally follow advance directives. Yet, there are many patients with debilitating long-term chronic and eventually fatal illnesses who reside at home. Some of these patients may not wish to have invasive, life-sustaining emergency interventions should their status rapidly deteriorate. To protect the wishes of these patients to forego life-sustaining treatments, a document titled Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) has been legally endorsed by many states. POLST gives EMS personnel the ability to rapidly determine whether a patient wishes to have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or receive any type of emergency interventions that may sustain life in the event when the patient suddenly becomes incapacitated (National POLST Paradigm, 2019).</p>
<p class="h7">Ethics Committees</p>
<p class="nonindent">Institutional ethics committees exist in many hospitals to assist clinicians with ethical dilemmas. The purpose of these multidisciplinary committees varies among institutions. In some hospitals, the committees exist solely for the purpose of developing policies; whereas in others, they may have a strong educational or consultation focus. Consultations can be conducted on the nursing unit, at the patient&#x2019;s bedside, or in a designated conference room. These committees usually are composed of people with some advanced training in ethics and are important resources for the health care team, patient, and family. Nurses with a particular interest or expertise in the area of ethics can serve as members of these committees, which are valuable resources for staff nurses. In addition, primary providers, social workers, and hospital chaplains are often members of the team.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ethical Decision Making</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ethical dilemmas are common and diverse in nursing practice. Situations vary, and experience indicates that there are no clear solutions to these dilemmas (<a href="#bib91">Beauchamp &#x0026; Childress, 2019</a>). However, the fundamental philosophical principles are the same, and the process of moral reflection helps nurses justify their actions. The systematic approach to ethical decision making can follow the steps of the nursing process. Ethics charts contained in all units within this text present case scenarios that challenge the reader to identify the ethical principles involved that may or may not be in conflict (<a href="#ct1-10">Chart&#x00A0;1-10</a>). <a href="#ct1-10">Chart&#x00A0;1-10</a> outlines the steps of an ethical analysis that may be used to resolve the moral dilemmas presented in these charts.</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Steps of an Ethical Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following guidelines reflect an active process in decision making, similar to the nursing process detailed in this chapter. Nurses can use these guidelines to engage in ethical decision making. Key resources that may assist in ethical decision making are also included.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>Once the ethical issue has been identified, assess the ethical/moral situations of the problem. This step entails recognition of the ethical, legal, and professional dimensions involved.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>a.</strong></span>Does the situation entail substantive moral problems (conflicts among ethical principles or professional obligations)? Examine the ethical issue using the principles of autonomy, beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>b.</strong></span>Are there procedural conflicts? (e.g., Who should make the decisions? Any conflicts among the patient, health care providers, family, and guardians?)</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>c.</strong></span>Identify the significant people involved and those affected by the decision.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>d.</strong></span>Identify agency or hospital policy or protocol to use when a conflict exists. Is there an ethics committee or council? How is an ethics consult made, and who may request this consultation? What other resources are available to help resolve this conflict?</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;planning:&lt;/b&gt; development of measurable goals and outcomes as well as a plan of care designed to assist the patient in resolving the diagnosed problems and achieving the identified goals and outcomes">Planning</button></strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>Collect information.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>a.</strong></span>Include the following information: the medical facts, treatment options, nursing diagnoses, legal data, and the values, beliefs, cultures, and religious components.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>b.</strong></span>Make a distinction between the factual information and the values/beliefs.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>c.</strong></span>Validate the patient&#x2019;s capacity, or lack of capacity, to make decisions.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>d.</strong></span>Identify any other relevant information that should be elicited.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>e.</strong></span>Identify the ethical/moral issues and the competing claims.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>f.</strong></span>If it is an end-of-life issue, determine whether an advance directive exists and whether a medical power of attorney or a heath care representative has been identified.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;implementation:&lt;/b&gt; actualization or carrying out of the nursing plan of care through nursing interventions">Implementation</button></strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>List the alternatives. Compare alternatives with applicable ethical principles and the 2015 ANA <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses.</em> Choose either of the frameworks that follow, or other frameworks, and compare outcomes.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>a.</strong></span><em>Utilitarian approach:</em> Predict the consequences of the alternatives; assign a positive or negative value to each consequence; choose the consequence that predicts the highest positive value or &#x201C;the greatest good for the greatest number.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>b.</strong></span><em>Deontologic approach:</em> Identify the relevant moral principles; compare alternatives with moral principles; appeal to the &#x201C;higher-level&#x201D; moral principle if there is a conflict.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>4.</strong></span>Decide and evaluate the decision.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>a.</strong></span>What is the best or morally correct action?</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>b.</strong></span>Give the ethical reasons for your decision.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>c.</strong></span>What are the ethical reasons against your decision or your biases?</p>
<p class="BoxNL2First"><span class="numah"><strong>d.</strong></span>How do you respond to the reasons against your decision?</p>

<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> Recently a team of staff nurses working on a pulmonary step-down unit was asked to examine the incidence of tracheotomy-related skin breakdown and found a 30% increase over the last year. The team reported these findings to the evidence-based practice council who determined the need to examine nursing interventions to improve skin integrity. As part of this team, what steps will you take to identify best practices? Based on this review, how will you determine which nursing practices would be most effective in helping to reduce the incidence of tracheotomy-related skin breakdown on your unit?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> You are part of an interprofessional team discussing the plan of care for a patient who experienced an ischemic stroke. After the meeting, the physical therapist asks you to explain how you formulate a nursing diagnosis and prioritize goals and interventions for your patients. How do you respond? The physical therapist also asks you for suggestions on ways the team could improve communication and teamwork to better address collaborative problems. Using professional practice guidelines, what recommendations do you share with the physical therapist?</p>
