<h4 class="h4" id="s1861">Liver Metastases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Metastases from other primary sites, particularly the digestive system, breast, and lung, are found in the liver 2.5 times more frequently than tumors due to primary liver cancers (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>). Malignant tumors are likely to reach the liver eventually, by way of the portal system or lymphatic channels, or by direct extension from an abdominal tumor. Moreover, the liver apparently is an ideal place for these malignant cells to thrive. Often, the first evidence of cancer in an abdominal organ is the appearance of liver metastases; unless exploratory surgery or an autopsy is performed, the primary tumor may never be identified.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1862">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The early manifestations of malignancy of the liver include pain&#x2014;a continuous dull ache in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, or back. Weight loss, loss of strength, anorexia, and anemia may also occur. The liver may be enlarged and irregular on palpation. Jaundice is present only if the larger bile ducts are occluded by the pressure of malignant nodules in the hilum of the liver. Ascites develops if such nodules obstruct the portal veins or if tumor tissue is seeded in the peritoneal cavity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1863">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of liver cancer is based on clinical signs and symptoms, the history and physical examination, and the results of laboratory and x-ray studies. Increased serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, GGT, and lactic dehydrogenase may occur. Leukocytosis (increased white blood cells), erythrocytosis (increased red blood cells), hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia may also be seen on laboratory assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein, which serves as a tumor marker, is elevated in 80% to 90% of patients with HCC, commonly to levels greater than 200 ng/mL (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). Patients with small tumors (&#x003C;5 cm in diameter) have normal or minimally elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen, a marker of advanced cancer of the digestive tract, may be elevated. These two markers together are useful to distinguish between metastatic liver disease and primary liver cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Many patients have metastases from the primary liver tumor to other sites by the time the diagnosis is made; metastases occur primarily to the lung but may also occur to regional lymph nodes, adrenals, bone, kidneys, heart, pancreas, or stomach.</p>
<p class="indent">X-rays, liver scans, CT scans, ultrasound studies, MRI, arteriography, and laparoscopy may be part of the diagnostic workup and may be performed to determine the extent of the cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are used to evaluate a wide range of metastatic tumors of the liver.</p>
<p class="indent">Confirmation of a tumor&#x2019;s histology can be made by biopsy under imaging guidance (CT scan or ultrasound) or laparoscopically. Local or systemic dissemination of the tumor by needle biopsy or fine-needle biopsy can occur. Because of the small but real risks of tumor seeding (0.5% to 2%), hemorrhage, and false-negative results from biopsy, many transplant centers avoid biopsy, particularly in patients who may be candidates for liver resection or liver transplantation. Assessment of the imaging characteristics for the diagnosis of HCC is preferred in these instances, and a confirmed diagnosis of HCC is made by frozen section at the time of surgery (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1864">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although surgical resection of the liver tumor is possible in some patients, the underlying cirrhosis is so prevalent in cancer of the liver that it increases the risks associated with surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been used to treat cancer of the liver with varying degrees of success. Although these therapies may prolong survival and improve quality of life by reducing pain and discomfort, their major effect is palliative.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radiation Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The use of external-beam radiation for the treatment of liver tumors has been limited by the radiosensitivity of normal hepatocytes and the risk of destruction of normal liver parenchyma. More effective methods of delivering radiation to tumors of the liver include IV or transarterial injection of a lipiodol-ethanol (radiopaque agent) mixture (also known as transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) that specifically attacks tumor-associated antigens, use of drug-eluding beads (DEB-TACE) and percutaneous placement of a high-intensity source for interstitial radiation therapy (delivery of radiation directly to the tumor cells). Internal radiotherapy can result in reduction in tumor size, but its effect on survival is yet to be determined (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3272">Schiff et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chemotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Typically, studies of patients with advanced cases of liver cancer have shown that the use of systemic chemotherapeutic agents leads to poor outcomes. For patients with stable hepatic function (Child class A), a targeted molecular therapy, sorafenib, has been developed and approved for use and is the standard systemic treatment for patients with advanced HCC. Regorafenib may be used in patients who cease responding to sorafenib (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). Systemic chemotherapy may be used to treat metastatic liver lesions. Embolization of tumor vessels with chemotherapy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1406" title="1406"></span>produces anoxic necrosis with high concentrations of trapped chemotherapeutic agents. This therapy has begun to show some promising results. An implantable pump has been used to deliver a high concentration of chemotherapy by constant infusion to the liver through the hepatic artery in cases of metastatic disease. This method has shown a moderate response rate (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Percutaneous Biliary Drainage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Percutaneous biliary or transhepatic drainage is used to bypass biliary ducts obstructed by liver, pancreatic, or bile duct tumors in patients who have inoperable tumors or are considered poor surgical risks. Under fluoroscopy, a catheter is inserted through the abdominal wall and past the obstruction into the duodenum. Such procedures are used to reestablish biliary drainage, relieve pressure and pain from the buildup of bile behind the obstruction, and decrease pruritus and jaundice. As a result, the patient is made more comfortable, and quality of life and survival are improved.</p>
<p class="indent">For several days after its insertion, the catheter is opened to external drainage. The bile is observed closely for amount, color, and presence of blood and debris. Complications of percutaneous biliary drainage include sepsis, leakage of bile, hemorrhage, and reobstruction of the biliary system by debris in the catheter or by encroaching tumor. Therefore, the patient is observed for fever and chills, bile drainage around the catheter, changes in vital signs, and evidence of biliary obstruction, including increased pain or pressure, pruritus, and recurrence of jaundice.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Nonsurgical Treatments</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Laser hyperthermia has been used to treat hepatic metastases. Heat has been directed to tumors through several methods to cause necrosis of the tumor cells while sparing normal tissue. In radiofrequency thermal ablation, a needle electrode is inserted into the liver tumor under imaging guidance. Radiofrequency energy passes through to the noninsulated needle tip, causing heat and tumor cell death from coagulation necrosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Immunotherapy is another treatment modality under investigation. In this therapy, lymphocytes with antitumor reactivity are given to the patient with hepatic cancer. Tumor regression has been demonstrated in patients with metastatic cancer for whom standard treatment has failed.</p>
<p class="indent">Transcatheter arterial embolization interrupts the arterial blood flow to small tumors by injecting small particulate embolic or chemotherapeutic agents (as described previously) into the artery supplying the tumor. As a result, ischemia and necrosis of the tumor occur.</p>
<p class="indent">For multiple small lesions, ultrasound-guided injection of alcohol promotes dehydration of tumor cells and tumor necrosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Srinivasan &#x0026; Friedman, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1865">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical resection is the treatment of choice when HCC is confined to one lobe of the liver and the function of the remaining liver is considered adequate for postoperative recovery. In the case of metastasis, hepatic resection can be performed if the primary site can be completely excised and the metastasis is limited. However, metastases to the liver are rarely limited or solitary. Capitalizing on the regenerative capacity of the liver cells, some surgeons have successfully removed 90% of the liver. However, the presence of cirrhosis limits the ability of the liver to regenerate. Laparoscopic liver resection for malignant tumors has also been described. Staging of liver tumors aids in predicting the likelihood of surgical cure (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In preparation for surgery, the patient&#x2019;s nutritional, fluid, and general physical status are assessed, and efforts are undertaken to ensure the best physical condition possible. Extensive diagnostic studies may be performed. Specific studies may include liver scan, liver biopsy, cholangiography, selective hepatic angiography, percutaneous needle biopsy, peritoneoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan, MRI, and blood tests, particularly determinations of serum alkaline phosphatase, AST, and GGT and its isoenzymes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lobectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Removal of a lobe of the liver is the most common surgical procedure for excising a liver tumor. If it is necessary to restrict blood flow from the hepatic artery and portal vein for longer than 15 minutes, it is likely that hypothermia will be used. For a right-liver lobectomy or an extended right lobectomy (including the medial left lobe), a thoracoabdominal incision is used. An extensive abdominal incision is made for a left lobectomy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Local Ablation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In patients who are not candidates for resection or transplantation, ablation of HCC may be accomplished by chemicals such as ethanol or by physical means such as radiofrequency ablation (most frequently used local ablative therapy) or microwave coagulation. These techniques may be performed under ultrasound or CT guidance laparoscopically or percutaneously. Radiofrequency ablation is becoming a standard mode of treatment; a tumor up to 5 cm in size can be destroyed in one session. The most common complications following ablation are local pain or bleeding. Serious complications are rare (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Immunotherapy with interferon may be used after surgical resection for HCC to prevent recurrence of the lesion in those patients who have developed the lesion related to hepatitis B or C.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Liver Transplantation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Liver transplantation offers good patient outcomes. Candidates with liver cancer meet stringent selection criteria, including having small, early-stage lesions (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Gerber, Baliga, &#x0026; Karp, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3320">Yang, Larson, Watt, et al., 2017</a>). The Milan criteria have been developed to limit transplantation to patients who are most likely to have better outcomes. The Milan criteria include that the patient must have a single tumor measuring less than 5 cm, or have three or fewer lesions with none over 3 cm in size (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). This treatment involves removing the liver and replacing it with a healthy donor organ. Studies report decreased recurrence rates of the primary liver malignancy after transplantation, with improvement in 4-year survival rates to approximately 85%, which is similar to survival rates seen in patients transplanted for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1407" title="1407"></span>nonmalignant disorders (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). Metastasis and recurrence may be enhanced by the immunosuppressive therapy that is needed to prevent rejection of the transplanted liver. In patients with small (less than 5 cm), single lesions, liver transplantation has been shown to be beneficial, but its use is limited by organ shortages. The increasing use of living donor transplantation may improve this situation and decrease the waiting time and tumor proliferation that is characteristic of patients with liver cancer (see later discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1866">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For patients with liver cancer anticipating surgery, support, education, and encouragement are provided to help them prepare psychologically for the surgery. After surgery, potential problems related to cardiopulmonary involvement may include vascular complications and respiratory and liver dysfunction. Metabolic abnormalities require careful attention. Because extensive blood loss may occur as well, the patient receives infusions of blood and IV fluids. The patient requires constant, close monitoring and care for the first 2 or 3 days, similar to postsurgical abdominal and thoracic nursing care.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy in an effort to relieve symptoms, they may be discharged home while still receiving one or both of these therapies. The patient may also go home with a biliary drainage system or hepatic artery catheter in place. In most cases, the hepatic artery catheter has been inserted surgically and has a prefilled infusion pump implanted subcutaneously that delivers a continuous chemotherapeutic dose until completed (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). A hepatic artery port may also be inserted to provide access for intermittent chemotherapy infusion. This port dwells under the skin, but because it provides direct arterial access, it is not used for continuous infusion therapy in the home environment; the access line is discontinued once the chemotherapeutic agent has infused. The patient and family require education about care of the biliary catheter and the effects and side effects of hepatic artery chemotherapy. This education is necessary because of participation of the patient and family in patient care in the home setting.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient to recognize and report the potential complications and side effects of the chemotherapy and the desirable and undesirable effects of the specific chemotherapy regimen. The nurse also emphasizes the importance of follow-up visits to assess the response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, if the patient is receiving chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, the nurse explains the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s role in managing the chemotherapy infusion and in assessing the infusion or insertion site. The nurse encourages the patient to resume routine activities as soon as possible while cautioning about falls and activities that may damage the infusion pump or site.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients at home with a biliary drainage system in place typically fear that the catheter will become dislodged; this fear is often shared by the patient&#x2019;s family. Reassurance and education can help reduce their fear that the catheter will fall out easily. The patient and family also require education on catheter care, including instruction on how to keep the catheter site clean and dry and how to assess the catheter and its insertion site. Irrigation of the catheter with sterile normal saline solution or water may be prescribed to keep the catheter patent and free of debris. The patient and caregivers are taught proper technique to avoid introducing bacteria into the biliary system or catheter during irrigation. They are instructed not to aspirate or draw back on the syringe during irrigation in order to prevent entry of irritating duodenal contents into the biliary tree or catheter. The patient and caregivers are also educated about the signs of complications and are encouraged to notify the nurse or primary provider if problems or questions arise. The nurse should consider using the teach-back method when educating patients and family about these interventions (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> for further discussion of the teach-back method).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with implantable ports are educated about the chemotherapy regimen, types of medications, effects and side effects that may occur, and appropriate management strategies if problems occur. If a hepatic artery port is inserted for intermittent chemotherapy, patients and their families are provided the same educational content. Such a port has an internal one-way valve; therefore, it is not aspirated for a blood return before the infusion is initiated. The patient is instructed to assess the port site between infusions and to note and report any sign of infection or inflammation.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">In many cases, referral for transitional or home care enables the patient with liver cancer to be at home in a familiar environment with family and friends. Because of the poor prognosis associated with liver cancer, the nurse serves a vital role in assisting the patient and family to cope with the symptoms that may occur and the prognosis. The patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological statuses are assessed as well as adequacy of pain relief, nutritional status, and presence of symptoms indicating complications of treatment or progression of disease. During home visits, the nurse assesses the function of the chemotherapy pump, the infusion site, and the biliary drainage system, if indicated. The nurse collaborates with the other members of the health care team, the patient, and the family to ensure effective pain management and to manage potential problems, which include weakness, pruritus, inadequate dietary intake, jaundice, and symptoms associated with metastasis to other sites. The nurse also assists the patient and family in making decisions about hospice care and assists with initiation of referrals. The patient is encouraged to discuss preferences for end-of-life care with family members and health care providers (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
