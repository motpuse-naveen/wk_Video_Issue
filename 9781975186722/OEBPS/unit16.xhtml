<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcapsA66">Y</span>ou are a home health nurse in an urban community. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has informed the agency where you work that there is an outbreak within your community of a novel respiratory virus that is implicated in causing pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. You know that when a novel virus begins to circulate among a population that universally has no immunity, some groups will be at greater risk of contracting the virus than others. You are worried about the patients you routinely care for as they have multiple comorbidities, likely placing them at higher risk. How will you find and integrate the best current evidence with clinical expertise, while also respecting patient and family preferences and values for delivery of optimal health care during a novel virus outbreak?</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
