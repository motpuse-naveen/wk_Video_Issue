<h4 class="h4" id="s1259">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Accurate assessment of immune function necessitates the nurse having a good working knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the immune system.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1260">Anatomy of the Immune System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The immune system is composed of an integrated collection of various cell types, each with a designated function in defending against infection and invasion by other organisms. Supporting this system are molecules that are responsible for the interactions, modulations, and regulation of the system. These molecules and cells participate in specific interactions with immunogenic <strong>epitopes</strong> (antigenic determinants) present on foreign materials, initiating a series of actions in a host, including the inflammatory response, the lysis of microbial agents, and the disposal of foreign toxins. The major components of the immune system include central and peripheral organs, tissues, and cells (<a href="#ff31-1">Fig. 31-1</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bone Marrow</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The white blood cells (WBCs) involved in immunity are produced in the bone marrow (<a href="#ff31-2">Fig. 31-2</a>). Like other blood cells, lymphocytes are generated from <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stem cells:&lt;/b&gt; precursors of all blood cells; reside primarily in the bone marrow">stem cells</button></strong> (undifferentiated cells). There are two types of lymphocytes&#x2014;<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B cells</button></strong>, also called B lymphocytes, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;T cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a cellular immune response">T cells</button></strong>, also called T lymphocytes (<a href="#ff31-3">Fig. 31-3</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lymphoid Tissues</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The spleen, composed of red and white pulp, acts somewhat like a filter. The red pulp is the site where old and injured red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed. The white pulp contains concentrations of lymphocytes. The lymph nodes, which are connected by lymph channels and capillaries, are distributed throughout the body. They remove foreign material from the lymph system before it enters the bloodstream. The lymph nodes also serve as centers for immune cell proliferation. The remaining lymphoid tissues contain immune cells that defend the body&#x2019;s mucosal surfaces against microorganisms (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Klimov, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1261">Function of the Immune System <img class="m" src="images/concepts.jpg" alt="icon" /></h5>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be871436a0ec" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immune response:&lt;/b&gt; the coordinated response of the components of the immune system to a foreign agent or organism">Immune Response</button></b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The basic function of the immune system is to remove foreign antigens such as viruses and bacteria to maintain homeostasis. There are two general types of immunity: natural (innate) and acquired (adaptive). Natural immunity or nonspecific immunity is present at birth. Acquired or specific immunity develops after birth. Each type of immunity has a distinct role in defending the body against harmful invaders, but the various components are usually interdependent (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Klimov, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Natural Immunity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Natural immunity, which is nonspecific, provides a broad spectrum of defense against and resistance to infection. It is considered the first line of host defense following antigen exposure, because it protects the host without remembering prior contact with an infectious agent (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>). Responses to a foreign invader are very similar from one encounter to the next, regardless of the number of times the invader is encountered. Natural (innate) immunity coordinates the initial response to pathogens through the production of cytokines and other effector molecules, which either activate cells for control of the pathogen (by elimination) or promote the development of the acquired <strong>immune response</strong>. The cells involved in this response are monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, <strong>natural killer (NK) cells</strong>, basophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. The early events in this process are critical in determining the nature of the adaptive immune response. Natural immune mechanisms can be divided into two stages: immediate (generally occurring within minutes) and delayed (occurring within several days after exposure) (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 988</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page989" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="989">p. 989</span></div>
<p class="h7">White Blood Cell Action</p>
<p class="nonindent">The cellular response is the key to the effective initiation of the immune response. WBCs, or leukocytes, participate in both the natural and the acquired immune responses. Granular leukocytes, or granulocytes (so called because of granules in their cytoplasm), fight invasion by foreign bodies or toxins by releasing cell mediators, such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins, and by engulfing the foreign bodies or toxins. Granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.</p>
<p class="indent">Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) are the first cells to arrive at the site where inflammation occurs. Eosinophils and basophils, other types of granulocytes, increase in number during allergic reactions and stress responses. Nongranular leukocytes include monocytes or macrophages (referred to as histiocytes when they enter tissue spaces) and lymphocytes. Monocytes are the first to arrive on the scene and function as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;phagocytic cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that engulf, ingest, and destroy foreign bodies or toxins">phagocytic cells</button></strong>, engulfing, ingesting, and destroying greater numbers and quantities of foreign bodies or toxins than granulocytes do. Lymphocytes, consisting of B cells and T cells, play major roles in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. About 70% to 80% of lymphocytes in the blood are T cells, and about 10% to 15% are B cells (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Haynes, Soderberg, &#x0026; Fauci, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Inflammatory Response</p>
<p class="nonindent">The inflammatory response is a major function of the natural immune system that is elicited in response to tissue injury or invading organisms. Chemical mediators assist this response by minimizing blood loss, walling off the invading organism, activating phagocytes, and promoting formation of fibrous scar tissue and regeneration of injured tissue. The inflammatory response (discussed further in <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>) is facilitated by physical and chemical barriers that are part of the human organism.</p>
<p class="h7">Physical and Chemical Barriers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Activation of the natural immunity response is enhanced by processes inherent in physical and chemical barriers. Physical surface barriers include intact skin, mucous membranes, and cilia of the respiratory tract, which prevent pathogens from gaining access to the body. The cilia of the respiratory tract, along with coughing and sneezing responses, filter and clear pathogens from the upper respiratory tract before they can invade the body further. Chemical barriers, such as mucus, acidic gastric secretions, enzymes in tears and saliva, and substances in sebaceous and sweat secretions, act in a nonspecific way to destroy invading bacteria and fungi. Viruses are countered by other means, such as interferon (see discussion later in chapter).</p>
<p class="h7">Immune Regulation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Regulation of the immune response involves balance and counterbalance. Dysfunction of the natural immune system can occur when the immune components are inactivated or when they remain active long after their effects are beneficial. A successful immune response eliminates the responsible antigen. If an immune response fails to develop and clear an antigen sufficiently, the host is considered immunocompromised or immunodeficient. If the response is overly robust or misdirected, allergies, asthma, or autoimmune disease results. The immune system&#x2019;s recognition of one&#x2019;s own cells or tissues as &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; rather than as self is the basis of many autoimmune disorders (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>). While the immune response is critical to the prevention of disease, it must be well controlled to curtail immunopathology. Most microbial infections induce an inflammatory response mediated by T cells and cytokines, which, in excess, can cause tissue damage (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2268">Haynes et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Therefore, regulatory mechanisms must be in place to suppress or halt the immune response. This is mainly achieved by the production of cytokines and transformation of growth factor that inhibit macrophage activation. In some cases, T-cell activation is so acute that these mechanisms fail, and pathology develops. Ongoing research on <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immunoregulation:&lt;/b&gt; complex system of checks and balances that regulates or controls immune responses">immunoregulation</button></strong> holds the promise of preventing graft rejection and aiding the body in eliminating cancerous or infected cells (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Chae &#x0026; Bothwell, 2018</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2299">Romano, Fanelli, Albany, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although natural immunity can often effectively combat infections, many pathogenic microbes have evolved that resist natural immunity. Acquired immunity is necessary to defend against these resistant agents.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acquired Immunity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acquired (adaptive) immunity usually develops due to prior exposure to an antigen through immunization (vaccination) or by contracting a disease, both of which generate a protective immune response. Weeks or months after exposure to a disease or vaccine, the body produces an immune response that is sufficient to defend against the disease on re-exposure. In contrast to the rapid but nonspecific natural immune response, this form of immunity relies on the recognition of specific foreign antigens. The acquired immune response is broadly divided into two mechanisms: (1) the cell-mediated response, involving T-cell activation, and (2) effector mechanisms, involving B-cell maturation and production of antibodies (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2268">Haynes et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The two types of acquired immunity are known as active and passive and are interrelated. Active acquired immunity refers to immunologic defenses developed by the person&#x2019;s own body. This immunity typically lasts many years or even a lifetime. Passive acquired immunity is temporary immunity transmitted from a source outside the body that has developed immunity through previous disease or immunization. Examples include immunity resulting from the transfer of antibodies from the mother to an infant in utero or through breast-feeding or receiving injections of immune globulin. Active and passive acquired immunity involve humoral and cellular (cell-mediated) immunologic responses (described later).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Response to Invasion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the body is invaded or attacked by bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens, it has three means of defense:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The phagocytic immune response</span></li>
<li><span>The humoral or antibody immune response</span></li>
<li><span>The cellular immune response</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The first line of defense, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;phagocytic immune response:&lt;/b&gt; the immune system&#x2019;s first line of defense, involving white blood cells that have the ability to ingest foreign particles">phagocytic immune response</button></strong>, primarily involves the WBCs (granulocytes and macrophages), which ingest foreign particles and destroy the invading agent; eosinophils are only weakly phagocytic. Phagocytes also remove the body&#x2019;s own dying or dead cells. Cells in necrotic tissue that are dying release substances that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page990" title="990"></span>trigger an inflammatory response. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apoptosis:&lt;/b&gt; a normal cell mechanism of programmed cell death">Apoptosis</button></strong>, or programmed cell death, is the body&#x2019;s way of destroying worn-out cells such as blood or skin cells or cells that need to be renewed (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A second protective response, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;humoral immune response:&lt;/b&gt; the immune system&#x2019;s second line of defense (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; antibody response)">humoral immune response</button></strong> (<em>synonym:</em> antibody response), begins with the B lymphocytes, which can transform themselves into plasma cells that manufacture antibodies. An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;antibody:&lt;/b&gt; a protein substance developed by the body in response to and interacting with a specific antigen">antibody</button></strong> is a protein substance developed by the body, transported in the bloodstream, and attempts to disable invaders. The third mechanism of defense, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cellular immune response:&lt;/b&gt; the immune system&#x2019;s third line of defense, involving the attack of pathogens by T cells">cellular immune response</button></strong>, involves the T lymphocytes, which can turn into special cytotoxic (or killer) T cells that can attack the pathogens.</p>
<p class="indent">The structural part of the invading or attacking organism that is responsible for stimulating antibody production is called an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;antigen:&lt;/b&gt; substance that induces the production of antibodies">antigen</button></strong> (or an immunogen). For example, an antigen can be a small patch of proteins on the outer surface of a microorganism. Not all antigens are naturally immunogenic; some must be coupled to other molecules to stimulate the immune response. A single bacterium or large molecule, such as a diphtheria or tetanus toxin, may have several antigens, or markers, on its surface, thus inducing the body to produce many different antibodies. Once produced, an antibody is released into the bloodstream and carried to the attacking organism. There, it combines with the antigen, binding with it like an interlocking piece of a jigsaw puzzle (<a href="#ff31-4">Fig. 31-4</a>). There are four well-defined stages in an immune response: recognition, proliferation, response, and effector (<a href="#ff31-5">Fig. 31-5</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Recognition Stage</p>
<p class="nonindent">Recognition of antigens as foreign, or non-self, by the immune system is the initiating event in any immune response. Recognition involves the use of lymph nodes and lymphocytes for surveillance. Lymph nodes are widely distributed internally throughout the body and in the circulating blood, as well as externally near the body&#x2019;s surfaces. They continuously discharge small lymphocytes into the bloodstream. These lymphocytes patrol the tissues and vessels that drain the areas served by that node. Lymphocytes recirculate from the blood to lymph nodes and from the lymph nodes back into the bloodstream in a continuous circuit. Lymphocytes and other cells have &#x201C;microbial sensors&#x201D; that identify molecules on microbes and other microorganisms. The interaction of these sensors with the offending agent sets off a cascade aimed at destroying the microbe. Invading organisms have pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) contained in their cell membranes that are recognized by the immune system cells. Once the receptors on the immune cells reach the PAMPs, the immune response is triggered. Macrophages play an important role in helping the circulating lymphocytes process the antigens. Both macrophages and neutrophils have receptors for antibodies and complement; as a result, they coat microorganisms with antibodies, complement, or both, thereby enhancing phagocytosis (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In a streptococcal throat infection, for example, the streptococcal organism gains access to the mucous membranes of the throat. A circulating lymphocyte moving through the tissues of the throat comes in contact with the organism. The lymphocyte recognizes the antigens on the microbe as different (non-self) and the streptococcal organism as antigenic (foreign). This triggers the second stage of the immune response&#x2014;proliferation.</p>
<p class="h7">Proliferation Stage</p>
<p class="nonindent">The circulating lymphocytes containing the antigenic message return to the nearest lymph node. Once in the node, these sensitized lymphocytes stimulate some of the resident T and B lymphocytes to enlarge, divide, and proliferate. T lymphocytes differentiate into cytotoxic (or killer) T cells, whereas B lymphocytes produce and release antibodies. Enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck in conjunction with a sore throat is one example of the immune response.</p>
<p class="h7">Response Stage</p>
<p class="nonindent">In the response stage, the differentiated lymphocytes function in either a humoral or a cellular capacity. This stage begins with the production of antibodies by the B lymphocytes in response to a specific antigen. The cellular response stimulates the resident lymphocytes to become cells that attack microbes directly rather than through the action of antibodies. These transformed lymphocytes are known as cytotoxic (killer) T cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Viral antigens induce a cellular response. This response is manifested by the increasing number of T lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) seen in the blood tests of people with viral illnesses such as infectious mononucleosis. (Cellular immunity is discussed later in this chapter.) Most immune responses to antigens involve both humoral and cellular responses, although one usually predominates. For example, during transplant rejection, the cellular response involving T cells predominates, whereas in the bacterial pneumonias and sepsis, the humoral response involving B cells plays the dominant protective role (<a href="#ct31-1">Chart 31-1</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Effector Stage</p>
<p class="nonindent">In the effector stage, either the antibody of the humoral response or the cytotoxic (killer) T cell of the cellular response reaches and connects with the antigen on the surface of the foreign invader. This action initiates activities involving an interplay of antibodies (humoral immunity), complement, and action by the cytotoxic T cells (cellular immunity).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Humoral Immune Response</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The humoral response is characterized by the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes in response to a specific antigen. Following antibody production, the macrophages of natural immunity and the special T lymphocytes of cellular immunity are involved in antigen recognition.</p>
<p class="h7">Antigen Recognition</p>
<p class="nonindent">Several theories explain the mechanisms by which B lymphocytes recognize the invading antigen and respond by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page992" title="992"></span>producing antibodies. It is known that B lymphocytes recognize and respond to invading antigens in more than one way.</p>
<p class="indent">The B lymphocytes respond to some antigens by directly triggering antibody formation; however, in response to other antigens, they need the assistance of T cells to trigger antibody formation. With the help of macrophages, the T lymphocytes are believed to recognize the antigen of a foreign invader. The T lymphocyte picks up the antigenic message, or &#x201C;blueprint,&#x201D; of the antigen and returns to the nearest lymph node with that message. B lymphocytes stored in the lymph nodes are subdivided into thousands of clones, which are stimulated to enlarge, divide, proliferate, and differentiate into plasma cells capable of producing specific antibodies to the antigen. Other B lymphocytes differentiate into B-lymphocyte clones with a memory for the antigen. These memory cells are responsible for the more exaggerated and rapid immune response in a person who is repeatedly exposed to the same antigen.</p>
<p class="h7">Role of Antibodies</p>
<p class="nonindent">Antibodies are large proteins, called <em>immunoglobulins,</em> that consist of two subunits, each containing a light and a heavy peptide chain held together by a chemical link composed of disulfide bonds. Each subunit has one portion that serves as a binding site for a specific antigen and another portion that allows the antibody molecule to take part in the complement system.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibodies defend against foreign invaders in several ways, and the type of defense used depends on the structure and composition of both the antigen and the immunoglobulin. The antibody molecule has at least two combining sites, or Fab fragments (<a href="#ff31-6">Fig. 31-6</a>). One antibody can act as a cross-link between two antigens, causing them to bind or clump together. This clumping effect, referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;agglutination:&lt;/b&gt; clumping effect occurring when an antibody acts as a cross-link between two antigens">agglutination</button></strong>, helps clear the body of the invading organism by facilitating phagocytosis. Some antibodies assist in the removal of offending organisms through <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;opsonization:&lt;/b&gt; the coating of antigen&#x2013;antibody molecules with a sticky substance to facilitate phagocytosis">opsonization</button></strong>. In this process, the antigen&#x2013;antibody molecule is coated with a sticky substance that also facilitates phagocytosis.</p>

<p class="indent">Antibodies also promote the release of vasoactive substances, such as histamine and slow-reacting substances, two of the chemical mediators of the inflammatory response. Antibodies do not function in isolation; rather, they mobilize other components of the immune system to defend against the invader.</p>
<p class="indent">The body can produce five different types of immunoglobulin (Ig). Each of the five types, or classes, is identified by a specific letter of the alphabet, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Classification is based on the chemical structure and biologic role of the individual immunoglobulin. Major characteristics of the immunoglobulins are summarized in <a href="#ct31-2">Chart 31-2</a>. The normal laboratory values for the three major Igs (IgA, IgG, and IgM) can be found in Appendix A on <img class="inline" src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/> at <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com">thepoint.lww.com</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Antigen&#x2013;Antibody Binding</p>
<p class="nonindent">The portion of the antigen involved in binding with the antibody is referred to as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;antigenic determinant:&lt;/b&gt; the specific area of an antigen that binds with an antibody-combining site and determines the specificity of the antigen&#x2013;antibody reaction">antigenic determinant</button></strong>. The most efficient immunologic responses occur when the antibody and antigen fit like a lock and key. Poor fit can occur with an antibody that was produced in response to a different antigen. This phenomenon is known as cross-reactivity. For example, in acute rheumatic fever, the antibody produced against <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> in the upper respiratory tract <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page993" title="993"></span>may cross-react with the patient&#x2019;s heart tissue, leading to heart valve damage.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cellular Immune Response</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The T lymphocytes are primarily responsible for cellular immunity. Stem cells continuously migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus gland, where they develop into T cells. Despite the partial degeneration of the gland at puberty, T cells continue to develop in the thymus gland. Several types of T cells exist, each with designated roles in the defense against bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and malignant cells. T cells attack foreign invaders directly rather than by producing antibodies.</p>
<p class="indent">Cellular reactions are initiated, with or without the assistance of macrophages, by the binding of an antigen to an antigen receptor located on the surface of a T cell. The T cells then carry the antigenic message, or blueprint, to the lymph nodes, where the production of other T cells is stimulated. Some T cells remain in the lymph nodes and retain a memory for the antigen. Other T cells migrate from the lymph nodes into the general circulatory system and ultimately to the tissues, where they remain until they bind with their respective antigens or die (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Types of T Lymphocytes</p>
<p class="nonindent">T cells include effector T cells, suppressor T cells, and memory T cells. The two major categories of effector T cells&#x2014;helper T cells (also referred to as CD4<sup>+</sup> cells) and cytotoxic T cells (also referred to as CD8<sup>+</sup> cells)&#x2014;participate in the destruction of foreign organisms. T cells interact closely with B cells, indicating that humoral and cellular immune responses are not separate, unrelated processes but rather are branches of the immune response that interact.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;helper T cells:&lt;/b&gt; lymphocytes that attack foreign invaders (antigens) directly">Helper T cells</button></strong> are activated on recognition of antigens and stimulate the rest of the immune system. When activated, helper T cells secrete <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytokines:&lt;/b&gt; messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)">cytokines</button></strong>, which attract and activate B cells, cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system. Cytokines are proteins produced by the cells of the immune system that determine the actions of the immune system cells. Separate subpopulations of helper T cells produce different types of cytokines and determine whether the immune response will be the production of antibodies or a cell-mediated immune response. Helper T cells also produce <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lymphokines:&lt;/b&gt; substances released by sensitized lymphocytes when they come in contact with specific antigens">lymphokines</button></strong>, one category of cytokines (<a href="#tt31-2">Table 31-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytotoxic T cells:&lt;/b&gt; lymphocytes that lyse cells infected with virus; also play a role in graft rejection">Cytotoxic T cells</button></strong> (killer T cells) attack the antigen directly by altering the cell membrane, causing cell lysis (disintegration), and releasing cytolytic enzymes and cytokines. Lymphokines can recruit, activate, and regulate other lymphocytes and WBCs. These cells then assist in destroying the invading organism. Delayed-type hypersensitivity is an example of an immune reaction that protects the body from antigens through the production and release of lymphokines (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;suppressor T cells:&lt;/b&gt; lymphocytes that decrease B-cell activity to a level at which the immune system is compatible with life">Suppressor T cells</button></strong> have the ability to decrease B-cell production, thereby keeping the immune response at a level that is compatible with health (e.g., sufficient to fight infection adequately without attacking the body&#x2019;s healthy tissues). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;memory cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are responsible for recognizing antigens from previous exposure and mounting an immune response">Memory cells</button></strong> are responsible for recognizing antigens from previous exposure and mounting an immune response (<a href="#tt31-3">Table 31-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Null Lymphocytes and Natural Killer Cells</p>
<p class="nonindent">Null lymphocytes and NK cells are other lymphocytes that assist in combating organisms. These cells are distinct from B cells and T cells and lack the usual characteristics of those cells. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;null lymphocytes:&lt;/b&gt; lymphocytes that destroy antigens already coated with the antibody">Null lymphocytes</button></strong>, a subpopulation of lymphocytes, destroy antigens already coated with antibody. These cells have special receptor sites on their surface that allow them to connect with the end of antibodies; this is known as antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.</p>
<p class="indent">NK cells are a class of lymphocytes that recognize infected and stressed cells and respond by killing these cells and by secreting macrophage-activating cytokine. The helper T cells contribute to the differentiation of null and NK cells.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Complement System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Circulating plasma proteins, known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;complement:&lt;/b&gt; series of enzymatic proteins in the serum that, when activated, destroy bacteria and other cells">complement</button></strong>, are made in the liver and activated when an antibody connects with its antigen. Complement plays an important role in the defense against microbes. Destruction of an invading or attacking organism or toxin is not achieved merely by the binding of the antibody and antigens; it also requires activation of complement, the arrival of killer T cells, or the attraction of macrophages. Complement has three major physiologic functions: defending the body against bacterial infection, bridging natural and acquired immunity, and disposing of immune complexes and the by-products associated with inflammation (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Klimov, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The proteins that comprise complement interact sequentially with one another in a cascading effect. The complement cascade is important to modifying the effector arm of the immune system. Activation of complement allows important events, such as removal of infectious agents and initiation of the inflammatory response, to take place. These events involve active parts of the pathway that enhance chemotaxis of macrophages and granulocytes, alter blood vessel permeability, change blood vessel diameters, cause cells to lyse, alter blood clotting, and cause other points of modification. These macrophages and granulocytes continue the body&#x2019;s defense by devouring the antibody-coated microbes and by releasing bacterial products.</p>
<p class="indent">The complement cascade may be activated by any of three pathways: classic, lectin, and alternative. The classic pathway is triggered after antibodies bind to microbes or other antigens and is part of the humoral type of adaptive immunity. The lectin pathway is activated when a plasma protein (mannose-binding lectin) binds to terminal mannose residue on the surface glycoproteins of microbes. The alternative pathway is triggered when complement proteins are activated on microbial surfaces. This pathway is part of natural immunity.</p>
<p class="indent">Complement components, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators all contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, as do chemokines, a group of cytokines. The activated neutrophils pass through the vessel walls to accumulate at the site of infection, where they phagocytize complement-coated microbes. This response is usually therapeutic and can be lifesaving if the cell attacked by the complement system is a true foreign invader. However, if that cell is part of the human organism, the result can be devastating disease and even death. Many autoimmune diseases and disorders characterized by chronic infection are thought to be caused in part by continued or chronic activation of complement, which in turn results in chronic inflammation. The RBCs and platelets have complement receptors and, as a result, play an important role in the clearance of immune complexes that consist of antigen, antibody, and components of the complement system (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Immunomodulators</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Antimicrobial agents and vaccines have yielded considerable therapeutic success and the immune system usually works effectively; however, many infectious diseases remain difficult clinical challenges. Treatment success may be compromised by defects of the immune system; in this case, enhancement of the host immune response may be therapeutically beneficial. An immunomodulator (also known as a biologic response modifier) affects the host via direct or indirect effects on one or more components of the immunoregulatory network. Interferons, colony-stimulating factors, and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) are examples of agents used to help enhance the immune system (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Davis &#x0026; Ballas, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Interferons</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Interferon</strong>, one type of biologic response modifier, is a nonspecific viricidal protein that is naturally produced by the body and capable of activating other components of the immune system. Interferons continue to be investigated to determine their roles in the immune system and their potential therapeutic effects in disorders characterized by disturbed immune responses. These substances have antiviral and antitumor properties. In addition to responding to viral infection, interferons are produced by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages in response to antigens. They are thought to modify the immune response by suppressing antibody production and cellular immunity. They also facilitate the cytolytic role of macrophages and NK cells. Interferons are used to treat immune-related disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis) and chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic hepatitis). Research continues to evaluate the effectiveness of interferons in treating cancers (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2287">Makowska, Braunschweig, Denecke, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.</p>
<p class="h7">Colony-Stimulating Factors</p>
<p class="nonindent">Colony-stimulating factors are a group of naturally occurring glycoprotein cytokines that regulate production, differentiation, survival, and activation of hematopoietic cells. Erythropoietin stimulates RBC production. Thrombopoietin plays a key regulatory role in the growth and differentiation of bone marrow cells. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) stimulates the growth and survival of eosinophils and basophils. Stem cell factor and IL-3 serve as stimuli for multiple hematopoietic cell lines. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte&#x2013;macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor all serve as growth factors for specific cell lines. These cytokines have attracted considerable interest for their potential role in immunomodulation (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2285">Leleu, Gay, Flament, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Monoclonal Antibodies</p>
<p class="nonindent">MoAbs have become available through technologic advances, enabling investigators to grow and produce targeted antibodies for specific pathologic organisms. This type of specificity allows MoAbs to destroy pathologic organisms and spare normal cells. The specificity of MoAbs depends on identifying key antigen proteins that are present on the surface of tumors, but not on normal tissues. When the MoAb attaches to the cell surface antigen, it blocks an important signal transduction pathway for communication between the malignant cells and the extracellular environment. The results may include an inability to initiate apoptosis, reproduce, or invade surrounding tissues (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Pento, 2017</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2302">Singh, Tank, Dwiwedi, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
