<p class="nonindent">Hematologic disorders vary widely in their etiologies and manifestations. While some are malignant, most hematologic disorders are benign. Disease processes can be quite complex, so a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved is important so that nurses may effectively assess, intervene, monitor, and educate patients about their conditions.</p>
