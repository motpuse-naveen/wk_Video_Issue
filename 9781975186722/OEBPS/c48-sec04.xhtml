<h4 class="h4" id="s2112">Primary Glomerular Diseases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Diseases that destroy the glomerulus of the kidney are the third most common cause of stage 5 CKD (USRDS, 2019). The glomeruli (a Greek word meaning &#x201C;filter&#x201D;) are the multiple small blood vessels within the nephron that remove urea from the blood. There are two major categories of glomerular diseases: glomerulonephritis and glomerulosclerosis. Primary glomerular diseases are within the kidney itself, while secondary glomerular kidney disease is a result of systemic disease, such as diabetes or lupus nephritis. Primary glomerulonephritis means that the kidney is inflamed, often due to an autoimmune disorder (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Antigen&#x2013;antibody complexes form in the blood and become trapped in the glomerular capillaries (the filtering portion of the kidney), inducing an inflammatory response. Immunoglobulin G (IgG)&#x2014;the major immunoglobulin (antibody) found in the blood&#x2014;can be detected in the glomerular capillary walls. The major clinical manifestations of glomerular injury include proteinuria, hematuria, decreased GFR, decreased excretion of sodium, edema, and hypertension (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>) (see <a href="#ct48-2">Chart&#x00A0;48-2</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2113">Acute Nephritic Syndrome</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;glomerulonephritis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the glomerular capillaries">Glomerulonephritis</button></strong> is an inflammation of the glomerular capillaries that can occur in acute and chronic forms. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;acute nephritic syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; type of kidney disease with glomerular inflammation">Acute nephritic syndrome</button></strong> is a type of acute glomerulonephritis. In acute nephritic syndrome, hematuria due to glomerular bleeding is seen as well as pus and cellular and granular casts in the urine. Variable proteinuria is noted. A decreased glomerular filtration rate is seen in severe cases of nephritic glomerular injury (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2114">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary glomerular diseases include postinfectious glomerulonephritis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, membrane proliferative glomerulonephritis, and membranous glomerulonephritis. Postinfectious causes are group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat that precedes the onset of glomerulonephritis by 2 to 3 weeks (see <a href="#ff48-1">Fig.&#x00A0;48-1</a>). Postinfectious glomerulonephritis may also follow impetigo (infection of the skin) and acute viral infections (upper respiratory tract infections, mumps, varicella zoster virus, Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus, hepatitis B, and human immune deficiency virus [HIV] infection). In some patients, antigens outside the body (e.g., medications, foreign serum) initiate the process, resulting in antigen&#x2013;antibody complexes being deposited in the glomeruli. In other patients, the kidney tissue itself serves as the inciting antigen (autoimmune phenomenon). With early <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1559" title="1559"></span>diagnosis and treatment, the kidney damage is generally reversible (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2115">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The primary presenting features of an acute glomerular inflammation are hematuria, edema, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;azotemia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal concentration of nitrogenous waste products in the blood">azotemia</button></strong> (an abnormal concentration of nitrogenous wastes in the blood), and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;proteinuria:&lt;/b&gt; protein in the urine">proteinuria</button></strong> (excess protein in the urine) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Norris, 2019</a>). The hematuria may be microscopic (identifiable only through microscopic examination) or macroscopic (visible to the eye). The urine may appear cola-colored because of red blood cells (RBCs) and protein plugs or casts; RBC casts indicate glomerular injury. Glomerulonephritis may be mild and the hematuria discovered incidentally through a routine urinalysis, or the disease may be severe, with AKI and oliguria.</p>
<p class="indent">Some degree of edema and hypertension is present in most patients. Marked proteinuria due to the increased permeability of the glomerular membrane may also occur, with associated pitting edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and fatty casts in the urine. BUN and serum creatinine levels may increase as urine output decreases. In addition, anemia may be present.</p>
<p class="indent">In the more severe form of the disease, patients also complain of headache, malaise, and flank pain. Older patients may experience circulatory overload with dyspnea, engorged neck veins, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema. Atypical symptoms include confusion, somnolence, and seizures, which are often confused with the symptoms of a primary neurologic disorder.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2116">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In acute nephritic syndrome, the kidneys become large, edematous, and congested. All renal tissues, including the glomeruli, tubules, and blood vessels, are affected to varying degrees. Patients with an immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy have an elevated serum IgA and low to normal complement levels. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescent analysis help identify the nature of the lesion; however, a kidney biopsy may be needed for definitive diagnosis. See <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a> for discussion of kidney biopsy.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient improves, the amount of urine will increase and the urinary protein and sediment will diminish. Some patients develop severe <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;uremia:&lt;/b&gt; an excess of urea and other nitrogenous wastes in the blood">uremia</button></strong> (an excess of urea and other nitrogenous wastes in the blood) within weeks and require dialysis for survival. Others, after a period of apparent recovery, insidiously develop chronic glomerulonephritis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2117">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of acute glomerulonephritis include hypertensive encephalopathy, heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a medical emergency, and therapy is directed toward reducing the blood pressure without impairing renal function. This can occur in acute nephritic syndrome or preeclampsia with chronic hypertension of greater than 130/80 mm Hg.</p>
<p class="indent">Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is characterized by a rapid decline in renal function. Without treatment, ESKD develops in a matter of weeks or months. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of acute glomerulonephritis (hematuria and proteinuria), but the course of the disease is more severe and rapid. Crescent-shaped cells accumulate in Bowman space, disrupting the filtering surface. Therapeutic plasma exchange and treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents or monoclonal antibodies have been used to reduce the inflammatory response.</p>
<p class="indent">Dialysis is initiated in acute glomerulonephritis if signs and symptoms of uremia are severe. However, the prognosis for patients with acute nephritic syndrome is excellent and it rarely causes CKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2118">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management consists primarily of treating symptoms, attempting to preserve kidney function, and treating complications promptly. Treatment may include prescribing corticosteroids, managing hypertension, and controlling proteinuria. Pharmacologic therapy depends on the cause of acute glomerulonephritis. If residual streptococcal infection is suspected, penicillin is the agent of choice. However, other antibiotic agents may be prescribed. Dietary protein may be restricted when renal insufficiency and nitrogen retention (elevated BUN) develop. Sodium is restricted when the patient has hypertension, edema, and heart failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2119">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although most patients with acute uncomplicated glomerulonephritis are cared for as outpatients, nursing care is important in every setting.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Care in the Hospital</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In a hospital setting, carbohydrates are given liberally to provide energy and reduce the catabolism of protein. I&#x0026;O is carefully measured and recorded. Fluids are prescribed based on the patient&#x2019;s fluid losses and daily body weight. Insensible fluid loss through the lungs (300 mL) and skin (500 mL) is considered when estimating fluid loss (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <a href="c10-sec01.xhtml#tt10-2">Table&#x00A0;10-2</a>) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Norris, 2019</a>). If treatment is effective, diuresis will begin, resulting in decreased edema and blood pressure. Proteinuria and microscopic hematuria may persist for many months. Other nursing interventions focus on patient education about the disease process, explanations of laboratory and other diagnostic tests, and preparation for safe and effective self-care at home.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education is directed toward managing symptoms and monitoring for complications. Fluid and diet restrictions must be reviewed with the patient to avoid worsening of edema and hypertension. The patient is instructed verbally and in writing to notify the primary provider if symptoms of kidney disease occur (e.g., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diminishing urine output) or at the first sign of any infection.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The importance of follow-up evaluations of blood pressure, laboratory blood studies for BUN and creatinine levels, and urinalysis for protein, to determine if the disease has progressed, is stressed to the patient. A referral for transitional, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1560" title="1560"></span>home, or community-based care may be indicated. A home visit from a nurse provides an opportunity for careful assessment of the patient&#x2019;s progress and detection of early signs and symptoms of renal insufficiency. If corticosteroids, immunosuppressant agents, or antibiotic medications are prescribed, the nurse uses the opportunity to review the dosages, desired actions, and adverse effects of medications and the precautions to be taken.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2120">Chronic Glomerulonephritis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic glomerulonephritis may be due to repeated episodes of acute nephritic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, chronic tubulointerstitial injury, or hemodynamically mediated glomerular sclerosis. Secondary glomerular diseases that can have systemic effects include systemic lupus erythematosus, Goodpasture syndrome (caused by antibodies to the glomerular basement membrane), and diabetic glomerulosclerosis (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2121">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys are reduced to as little as one fifth their normal size (consisting largely of fibrous tissue). The cortex layer shrinks to 1 to 2 mm in thickness or less. Bands of scar tissue distort the remaining cortex, making the surface of the kidney rough and irregular. Numerous glomeruli and their tubules become scarred, and the branches of the renal artery are thickened. The resulting severe glomerular damage can progress to stage 5 CKD and require RRT. Patients who initially have impaired kidney function or notable proteinuria tend to have increased progression of kidney disease (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Parikh et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2122">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The symptoms of chronic glomerulonephritis vary. Some patients with severe disease have no symptoms at all for many years. The condition may be discovered when hypertension or elevated BUN and serum creatinine levels or proteinuria are detected. Most patients report general symptoms, such as loss of weight and strength, increasing irritability, and nocturia (an increased need to urinate at night). Headaches, dizziness, and digestive disturbances are also common. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing CKD and ESKD and the development of late complications.</p>
<p class="indent">As chronic glomerulonephritis progresses, signs and symptoms of CKD may develop. With undiagnosed or untreated disease, the patient appears poorly nourished, with a yellow-gray pigmentation of the skin and periorbital and peripheral (dependent) edema. Blood pressure may be normal or severely elevated. Retinal findings include hemorrhage, exudate, narrowed tortuous arterioles, and papilledema. Anemia causes pale mucous membranes. Cardiomegaly, a gallop rhythm, distended neck veins, and other signs and symptoms of heart failure may be present. Crackles can be heard in the bases of the lungs.</p>
<p class="indent">Peripheral neuropathy with diminished deep tendon reflexes and neurosensory changes occur late in the disease. The patient becomes confused and demonstrates a limited attention span. Additional late findings include evidence of pericarditis with a pericardial friction rub and pulsus paradoxus (difference in blood pressure during inspiration and expiration of greater than 10 mm Hg). Pleural effusions may be seen on chest x-ray.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2123">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A number of laboratory abnormalities occur. Urinalysis reveals a fixed specific gravity of about 1.010, variable proteinuria, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urinary casts:&lt;/b&gt; proteins secreted by damaged kidney tubules">urinary casts</button></strong> (proteins secreted by damaged kidney tubules). As kidney disease progresses and the GFR falls below 50 mL/min, the following changes occur:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Anemia secondary to decreased erythropoiesis (production of RBCs)</span></li>
<li><span>Decreased serum calcium level (calcium binds to phosphorus to compensate for elevated serum phosphorus levels)</span></li>
<li><span>Hyperkalemia due to decreased urinary potassium excretion, acidosis, catabolism, and potassium intake from food and medications</span></li>
<li><span>Hypoalbuminemia with edema secondary to protein loss through the damaged glomerular membrane</span></li>
<li><span>Increased serum phosphorus level due to decreased renal excretion of phosphorus</span></li>
<li><span>Impaired nerve conduction due to electrolyte abnormalities and uremia resulting in peripheral neuropathy</span></li>
<li><span>Mental status changes</span></li>
<li><span>Metabolic acidosis from decreased acid secretion by the kidney and inability to regenerate bicarbonate</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Chest x-rays may show cardiac enlargement and pulmonary edema due to volume overload. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may be normal or may indicate left ventricular hypertrophy associated with hypertension and signs of electrolyte disturbances, such as tall, tented (or peaked) T waves associated with hyperkalemia. Renal ultrasound shows decreased renal mass in both kidneys (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2124">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of symptoms guides the treatment. If the patient has hypertension, efforts are made to reduce the blood pressure with sodium and water restriction, antihypertensive agents, or both. Weight is monitored daily, and diuretic medications are prescribed to treat fluid overload. Proteins of high-biologic value (eggs, meats, fish) are provided to promote good nutritional status. Adequate calories are provided to spare protein for tissue growth and repair. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) must be treated promptly to prevent further kidney damage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are avoided as well as other nephrotoxic medications and diagnostic studies which necessitate the administration of intravenous (IV) contrast dye (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Nahar, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dialysis is initiated early in the course of the disease to keep the patient in optimal physical condition, prevent fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and minimize the risk of complications of kidney disease. The course of dialysis is smoother if treatment begins before the patient develops complications.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2125">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Whether the patient is hospitalized or cared for in the home, the nurse observes the patient for common fluid and electrolyte disturbances in kidney disease (see <a href="c48-sec02.xhtml#tt48-1">Table&#x00A0;48-1</a>). Changes in fluid and electrolyte status and in cardiac and neurologic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1561" title="1561"></span>status are promptly reported to the primary provider. Throughout the course of the disease and treatment, the nurse gives emotional support by providing opportunities for the patient and family to verbalize their concerns, have their questions answered, and explore their options (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse has a major role in educating the patient and family about the prescribed treatment plan and the risks associated with nonadherence. Instructions to the patient include explanations and scheduling for follow-up evaluations: blood pressure, urinalysis for protein and casts, and laboratory studies of BUN and serum creatinine levels. If long-term dialysis is needed, the nurse educates the patient and family about the procedure, how to care for the access site, dietary and fluid restrictions, and other necessary lifestyle modifications. These topics are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Periodic hospitalization, visits to the outpatient clinic or office, and home care referrals provide the nurse in each setting with the opportunity for careful assessment of the patient&#x2019;s progress and continued education about changes to report to the primary provider (worsening signs and symptoms of kidney disease, such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and diminished urine output). Specific education may include explanations of recommended diet and fluid modifications; medications (purpose, desired effects, adverse effects, dosage, and administration schedule); and encouragement to achieve and maintain a healthy weight (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Chicca, 2020</a>). The nurse consults with the renal dietitian for detailed dietary education.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Periodic laboratory evaluations of creatinine clearance and BUN and serum creatinine levels are carried out to assess residual renal function and the need for dialysis or transplantation. If dialysis is initiated, the patient and family require considerable assistance and support in dealing with therapy and its long-term implications. The patient and family are reminded of the importance of participation in health promotion activities, including health screening. The patient is instructed to inform all health care providers about the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis so that all medical management, including pharmacologic therapy, is based on altered renal function.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2126">Nephrotic Syndrome</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nephrotic syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; type of kidney disease with increased glomerular permeability and massive proteinuria">Nephrotic syndrome</button></strong> is a type of kidney disease characterized by increased glomerular permeability and is manifested by massive proteinuria (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Mahaffey, 2017</a>). Clinical findings include proteinuria (a marked increase in protein [particularly albumin] in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (a decrease in albumin in the blood), diffuse edema, high serum cholesterol, and hyperlipidemia (elevated low-density lipoproteins). A hypercoagulable state is often present and the patient has an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelepouris &#x0026; Rovin, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff48-2">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff48-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff48-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;48-2 &#x2022;</span> Pathophysiology of the nephrotic syndrome.

Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The syndrome is apparent in any condition that seriously damages the glomerular capillary membrane and results in increased glomerular permeability to plasma proteins. Although the liver is capable of increasing the production of albumin, it cannot keep up with the daily loss of albumin through the kidneys. Thus, hypoalbuminemia results (see Fig.&#x00A0;48-2).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2127">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nephrotic syndrome occurs with many intrinsic kidney diseases and systemic diseases that cause glomerular damage. It is not a specific glomerular disease but a constellation of clinical findings that result from the glomerular damage.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2128">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The major manifestation of nephrotic syndrome is edema. It is usually soft and pitting and commonly occurs around the eyes (periorbital), in dependent areas (sacrum, ankles, and hands), and in the abdomen (ascites). Patients may also exhibit irritability, headache, and malaise.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2129">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Proteinuria (predominately albumin) exceeding 3.5 g/day is the hallmark of the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Protein excretion can be measured on a 24-hour urine collection; the normal value is less than 150 mg/day (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelepouris &#x0026; Rovin, 2019</a>). Urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1562" title="1562"></span>may be performed to categorize the type of proteinuria. The urine may also contain increased white blood cells (WBCs) as well as granular and epithelial casts. A needle biopsy of the kidney may be performed for histologic examination of renal tissue to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2130">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications of nephrotic syndrome include infection (due to a deficient immune response), thromboembolism (especially of the renal vein and deep veins of the legs), pulmonary embolism, AKI (due to hypovolemia), and accelerated atherosclerosis (due to hyperlipidemia).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2131">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment is focused on addressing the underlying disease state causing proteinuria, slowing progression of CKD, and relieving symptoms. Typical treatment includes diuretic agents for edema, ACE inhibitors to reduce proteinuria, lipid-lowering agents for hyperlipidemia, and dietary sodium restriction (approximately 2 g of sodium/day) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kelepouris &#x0026; Rovin, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2132">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the early stages of nephrotic syndrome, nursing management is similar to that of the patient with acute glomerulonephritis, but as the condition worsens, management is similar to that of the patient with ESKD (see the following section).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with nephrotic syndrome need adequate education about the importance of following all medication and dietary regimens so that their condition can remain stable for as long as possible. Patients must be educated about the importance of promptly communicating any health-related change to their primary providers so that appropriate medication and dietary changes can be made before further changes occur within the glomeruli.</p>
