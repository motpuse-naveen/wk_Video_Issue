<p class="nonindent">The goal in the preoperative period is for the patient to be as healthy as possible. Every attempt is made to assess for and address risk factors that may contribute to postoperative complications and delay recovery (see <a href="#ct14-3">Chart&#x00A0;14-3</a>). The preoperative assessment provides information regarding underlying conditions that may affect the patient&#x2019;s response to surgery techniques and anesthesia (AORN, 2019). During the physical examination, many factors that have the potential to affect the patient undergoing surgery are considered, such as joint mobility. Genetic considerations are also taken into account during assessment to prevent complications with anesthesia (see <a href="c14-sec08.xhtml#ct14-4">Chart&#x00A0;14-4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Asking the patient about use of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, including herbal and other supplements, provides useful information. Activity and functional levels should be determined, including that involving regular aerobic exercise. Known allergies and sensitivities to drugs, foods, adhesives, and latex could avert an anaphylactic response (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1223">Barash et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Patients may have early manifestations of a latex allergy and be unaware of this. If a patient states that he or she is allergic to kiwi, avocado, or banana, or cannot blow up balloons, there may be an association with an allergy to latex.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient should be assessed for latex allergy and sensitivities. Latex is found in some food (such as bananas and kiwi) as well as in some hospital materials and equipment. Most hospital products today are latex-free, especially in ORs; however, special precautions are still taken to eliminate the risk of exposure to the patient. These precautions include thorough cleaning of the surgical areas between cases, awareness of allergy among surgical team members, ensuring the materials used are latex-free, and eliminating the use of latex powdered gloves during the case (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1245">Mendez, Martinez, Lopez, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The preoperative assessment should pay attention to the possible presence of undiagnosed OSA. The STOP-Bang is one assessment that may be performed (<em>S</em>noring, <em>T</em>ired, <em>O</em>bserved, <em>P</em>ressure, <em>B</em>MI, <em>A</em>ge, <em>N</em>eck, <em>G</em>ender) to assess for the presence of OSA (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1236">Chung et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Health care providers also should be alert for signs of interpersonal violence, including intimate partner violence, which can occur at any age, in either sex, and in any socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural group. Findings need to be reported accordingly (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for further discussion of signs of interpersonal violence). Laboratory tests and other diagnostic tests are prescribed when indicated by information obtained from the history and physical examination. Autologous blood donation or patient self-donation is discussed as needed for the type of surgical procedure planned. See <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a> for further discussion of autologous blood donation.</p>
