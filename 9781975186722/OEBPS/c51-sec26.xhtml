<h4 class="h4" id="s2402">Cancer of the Vulva</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Primary cancer of the vulva is rare, representing less than 1% of all cancers (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Weinberg &#x0026; Gomez-Martinez, 2019</a>). It is most common in women who are postmenopausal, although its incidence in younger women is increasing. Possible risk factors include smoking, HPV infection, HIV infection, and immunosuppression. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for most primary vulvar tumors. Less common are Bartholin gland cancer, vulvar sarcoma, and malignant melanoma. Little is known about what causes this disease; however, increased risk may be related to chronic vulvar irritation. In younger women, HPV infection may be implicated, especially types 16, 18, and 31. Prevention includes delaying onset of sexual activity to avoid early exposure to HPV, administration of the HPV vaccine, and avoidance of smoking. Regular pelvic examinations, Pap smears, and vulvar self-examination are helpful in early detection. Women with persistent irritation or itching should be encouraged to seek evaluation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2403">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vulvar cancers are rarely asymptomatic (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Weinberg &#x0026; Gomez-Martinez, 2019</a>). Long-standing pruritus and soreness are the most common symptoms of vulvar cancer. Itching occurs in half of all patients with vulvar malignancy. Bleeding, dysuria, foul-smelling discharge, and pain may also be present and are usually signs of advanced disease. Cancerous lesions of the vulva are visible and accessible and grow relatively slowly. Early lesions appear as a chronic dermatitis; later, patients may note a lump that continues to grow and becomes a hard, ulcerated, cauliflowerlike growth. Biopsy should be performed on any vulvar lesion that persists, ulcerates, or fails to heal quickly with proper therapy. Vulvar malignancies may appear as a lump or mass, redness, or a lesion that fails to heal.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2404">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vulvar intraepithelial lesions are preinvasive and are also called <em>vulvar carcinoma in situ.</em> They may be treated by local excision, laser ablation, application of chemotherapeutic creams, or cryosurgery.</p>
<p class="indent">When invasive vulvar carcinoma exists, treatment may include wide excision of the vulva and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vulvectomy:&lt;/b&gt; removal of the tissue of the vulva">vulvectomy</button></strong> (removal of the vulva). An effort is made to individualize treatment, depending on the extent of the disease. A wide excision is performed only if lymph nodes are normal. More pervasive lesions require vulvectomy with deep pelvic node dissection. Vulvectomy is very effective at prolonging life but is frequently followed by complications (i.e., scarring, wound breakdown, leg swelling, vaginal stenosis, or rectocele). To reduce complications, only necessary tissue is removed. External-beam radiation may be used, resulting in sunburnlike irritation that usually resolves in 6 to 12 months. Laser therapy and chemotherapy are other possible treatment options.</p>
<p class="indent">If a widespread area is involved or the disease is advanced, a radical vulvectomy with bilateral groin dissection may be performed. Antibiotic and heparin prophylaxis may be prescribed preoperatively and continued postoperatively to prevent infection, DVT, and PE. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are applied to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the role of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of vulvar cancer remains to be determined, chemotherapy may be helpful when used in combination with radiation therapy in treatment for advanced disease. The combination of radiation and chemotherapy may reduce the size of the cancer, resulting in less extensive subsequent surgery (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Weinberg &#x0026; Gomez-Martinez, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical trials to determine the most effective treatment are difficult to conduct because there are few patients with this condition. Morbidity with recurrence of the disease is high, and patterns of recurrence vary. Reconstruction after vulvectomy is performed by plastic surgeons when appropriate and desired.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2405">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Obtaining the Health History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The health history is a valuable tool for establishing rapport with the patient. The reason the patient is seeking health care is apparent. What the nurse can tactfully elicit is the reason a delay, if any, occurred in seeking health care&#x2014;for example, because of modesty, economics, denial, neglect, or fear (partners who are abusive sometimes prevent women from seeking health care). Factors involved in any delay in seeking health care and treatment may also affect recovery. The patient&#x2019;s health habits and lifestyle are assessed, and her receptivity to education is evaluated. Psychosocial factors are also assessed. Preoperative preparation and psychological support begin at this time.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Preoperative Care</h6>
<p class="h7a">Relieving Anxiety</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to surgery, the patient must be allowed time to talk and ask questions. Fear often decreases when a woman who is to undergo wide excision of the vulva or vulvectomy learns that the possibility for subsequent sexual relations is good. The nurse reinforces the information the surgeon has given to the patient and addresses the patient&#x2019;s questions and concerns.</p>
<p class="h7">Preparing Skin for Surgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">Skin preparation may include cleansing the lower abdomen, inguinal areas, upper thighs, and vulva with chlorhexidine for several days before the surgical procedure. The patient may be instructed to do this at home.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Postoperative Care</h6>
<p class="h7a">Relieving Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the wide excision, the patient may experience severe pain and discomfort even with minimal movement. Therefore, analgesic agents are given preventively (i.e., around the clock at designated times) to relieve pain, increase the patient&#x2019;s comfort level, and allow mobility. Patient-controlled analgesia (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1699" title="1699"></span>may be used to relieve pain and promote patient comfort. Careful positioning using pillows usually increases comfort, as do soothing backrubs. A low Fowler position or, occasionally, a pillow placed under the knees reduces pain by relieving tension on the incision; however, efforts must be made to avoid pressure behind the knees, which increases the risk of DVT. Positioning the patient on her side, with pillows between her legs and against the lumbar region, provides comfort and reduces tension on the surgical wound.</p>
<p class="h7">Improving Skin Integrity</p>
<p class="nonindent">A pressure-reducing mattress may be used to prevent pressure injuries. Moving from one position to another requires time and effort; the use of an overbed trapeze bar may help the patient move herself more easily. The extent of the surgical incision and the type of dressing are considered when choosing strategies to promote skin integrity. Intact skin needs to be protected from drainage and moisture. Dressings are changed as needed to ensure patient comfort, to perform wound care and irrigation (if prescribed), and to permit observation of the surgical site.</p>
<p class="indent">The wound is usually cleansed daily with warm, normal saline irrigations or other antiseptic solutions as prescribed, or a transparent dressing may be in place over the wound to minimize exposure to the air and subsequent pain. The appearance of the surgical site and the characteristics of drainage are assessed and documented. After the dressings are removed, a bed cradle may be used to keep the bed linens away from the surgical site.</p>
<p class="h7">Supporting Positive Sexuality and Sexual Function</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient who undergoes vulvar surgery usually experiences concerns about body image, sexual attractiveness, and functioning. Establishing a trusting nurse&#x2013;patient relationship is important for the patient to feel comfortable with expressing her concerns and fears. The patient is encouraged to discuss her concerns with her sexual partner as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Because alterations in sexual sensation and functioning depend on the extent of surgery, the nurse needs to know about any structural and functional changes resulting from the surgery. Referral of the patient and her partner to a sex counselor may help them address these changes and resume satisfying sexual activity.</p>
<p class="h7">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Location, extent, and exposure of the surgical site and incision put the patient at risk for contamination of the site, infection, and sepsis. The patient is monitored closely for local and systemic signs and symptoms of infection: purulent drainage, redness, increased pain, fever, and increased white blood cell count. The nurse assists in obtaining specimens for culture if infection is suspected and administers antibiotic agents as prescribed. Hand hygiene&#x2014;always a crucial infection-preventing measure&#x2014;is of particular importance along with wearing masks whenever there is an extensive area of exposed tissue. Catheters, drains, and dressings are handled carefully with gloves on to avoid cross-contamination. A low-residue diet prevents straining on defecation and wound contamination.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is at risk for complications of VTE, which include DVT and PE, because of the positioning required during surgery, postoperative edema, and the immobility needed to promote healing. SCDs are applied, and other prophylactic measures may be prescribed for patients at high risk. The patient is encouraged and reminded to perform ankle exercises to minimize venous pooling, which leads to VTE. The patient is encouraged and assisted in changing positions by using the overbed trapeze bar. Pressure behind the knees is avoided when positioning the patient, because this may increase venous pooling. The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of DVT (leg pain, redness, warmth, edema) and PE (chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea). Fluid intake is encouraged to prevent dehydration, which also increases the risk of DVT.</p>
<p class="indent">The extent of the surgical incision and possibly wide excision of tissue increase the risk of postoperative bleeding and hemorrhage. Pressure dressings are applied after surgery to minimize this risk.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The patient must be monitored closely for signs of hemorrhage and resulting hypovolemic shock. These signs may include decreased blood pressure; increased pulse rate; decreased urine output; decreased mental status; and cold, clammy skin.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">If hemorrhage and shock occur, interventions include fluid replacement, blood component therapy, and vasopressor medications. Laboratory results (e.g., hematocrit and hemoglobin levels) and hemodynamic monitoring are used to assess the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. Depending on the specific cause of hemorrhage, the patient may be returned to the operating room. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for a detailed discussion of shock.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preparing the patient for hospital discharge begins before hospital admission. The patient and family are informed about what to expect during the immediate postoperative and recovery periods. Depending on the changes resulting from the surgery, the patient and her family may need education about wound care, urinary catheterization, and possible complications. The patient is encouraged to share her concerns and to assume increasing responsibility for her own care. She is encouraged and assisted in learning to care for the surgical site. A referral for transitional, home, or community-based care is made as indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses are in an ideal position to educate women about performing regular vulvar self-examinations. Using a mirror, patients can see what constitutes normal female anatomy and learn about changes that should be reported (e.g., lesions, ulcers, masses, persistent itching). Nurses must urge women to seek health care if they notice anything abnormal, because vulvar cancer is one of the most curable of all malignant conditions.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients may be discharged early in their postoperative recovery to home or a subacute facility. During this phase, the patient&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1700" title="1700"></span>physical status and psychological responses to the surgery are assessed. In addition, the patient is assessed for complications and healing of the surgical site. During home visits, the nurse assesses the home to determine if modifications are needed to facilitate care. The home visit is used to reinforce previous education and to assess the patient&#x2019;s and the family&#x2019;s understanding of and adherence to the prescribed treatment strategies. Follow-up phone calls by the nurse to the patient between home visits are usually reassuring to the patient and family, who may be responsible for performing complex care procedures. Attention to the patient&#x2019;s psychological responses is important because the patient may become discouraged and depressed because of alterations in body image and a slow recovery. Communication between the nurse involved in the patient&#x2019;s immediate postoperative care and the home health nurse is essential to ensure continuity of care.</p>
