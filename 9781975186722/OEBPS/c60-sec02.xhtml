<h4 class="h4" id="s2915">Assessment of the Nervous System</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An assessment of the nervous system involves conducting a health history and physical assessment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2916">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An important aspect of the neurologic assessment is the history of the present illness. The initial interview provides an excellent opportunity to systematically explore the patient&#x2019;s current condition and related events while simultaneously observing overall appearance, mental status, posture, movement, and affect. Depending on the patient&#x2019;s condition, the nurse may need to rely on yes-or-no answers to questions, a review of the medical record, input from witnesses or the family, or a combination of these.</p>
<p class="indent">Neurologic disorders may be stable or progressive, characterized by symptom-free periods as well as fluctuations in symptoms. The health history therefore includes details about the onset, character, severity, location, duration, and frequency of symptoms and signs; associated complaints; precipitating, aggravating, and relieving factors; progression, remission, and exacerbation; and the presence or absence of similar symptoms among family members.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The symptoms of neurologic disorders are as varied as the disease processes. Symptoms may be subtle or intense, fluctuating or permanent, inconvenient or devastating. This chapter discusses the most common signs and symptoms associated with neurologic disease; the relationship of specific signs and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1978" title="1978"></span>symptoms to a disorder is presented in later chapters in this unit.</p>
<p class="h7">Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pain is considered an unpleasant sensory perception and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Pain is therefore considered multidimensional and entirely subjective. Pain can be acute or chronic. In general, acute pain lasts for a relatively short period of time and remits as the pathology resolves. In neurologic disease, acute pain may be associated with brain hemorrhage, spinal disc disease (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>), or trigeminal neuralgia. In contrast, chronic or persistent pain extends for long periods of time and may represent a broader pathology. This type of pain can occur with many degenerative and chronic neurologic conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis). See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for a more detailed discussion of pain.</p>
<p class="h7">Seizures</p>
<p class="nonindent">Seizures are the result of abnormal electrical discharges in the cerebral cortex, which then manifest as an alteration in sensation, behavior, movement, perception, or consciousness. The alteration may be short, such as in a blank stare that lasts only a second, or of longer duration, such as a tonic&#x2013;clonic grand mal seizure that can last several minutes. The seizure activity reflects the area of the brain affected. Seizures can occur as isolated events, such as when induced by a high fever, alcohol or drug withdrawal, or hypoglycemia. A seizure may also be the first obvious sign of a brain lesion (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Dizziness and Vertigo</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dizziness is an abnormal sensation of imbalance or movement. It is common in the older adult and a common complaint encountered by health professionals (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>). Dizziness can have a variety of causes, including viral syndromes, hot weather, roller-coaster rides, and middle ear infections, to name a few. One difficulty confronting health care providers when assessing dizziness is the vague and varied terms that patients use to describe the sensation.</p>
<p class="indent">About 50% of all patients with dizziness have <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vertigo:&lt;/b&gt; illusion of movement in which the individual or the surroundings are sensed as moving">vertigo</button></strong>, or the illusion of movement in which the individual or the surroundings are sensed as moving, usually as rotation (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>). Vertigo is usually a manifestation of vestibular dysfunction. It can be so severe as to result in spatial disorientation, lightheadedness, loss of equilibrium (staggering), and nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p class="h7">Visual Disturbances</p>
<p class="nonindent">Visual defects that cause people to seek health care can range from the decreased visual acuity associated with aging to sudden blindness caused by glaucoma. Normal vision depends on functioning visual pathways through the retina and optic chiasm and the radiations into the visual cortex in the occipital lobes. Lesions of the eye itself (e.g., cataract), lesions along the pathway (e.g., tumor), or lesions in the visual cortex (e.g., stroke) interfere with normal visual acuity. Abnormalities of eye movement (as in the nystagmus associated with multiple sclerosis) can also compromise vision by causing diplopia or double vision. See <a href="c58.xhtml">Chapter 58</a> for a more detailed discussion of disorders that affect vision.</p>
<p class="h7">Muscle Weakness</p>
<p class="nonindent">Muscle weakness is a common manifestation of neurologic disease. It frequently coexists with other symptoms of disease and can affect a variety of muscles, causing a wide range of disability. Weakness can be sudden and permanent, as in stroke, or progressive, as in neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Any muscle group can be affected.</p>
<p class="h7">Abnormal Sensation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Abnormal sensation is a neurologic manifestation of both central and peripheral nervous system disease. Altered sensation can affect small or large areas of the body. It is frequently associated with weakness or pain and is potentially disabling. Lack of sensation places a person at risk for falls and injury.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health, Family, and Social History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse may inquire about any family history of genetic diseases (see <a href="#ct60-1">Chart 60-1</a>). A review of the medical history, including a system-by-system evaluation, is part of the health history. The nurse should be aware of any history of trauma or falls that may have involved the head or spinal cord. Questions regarding the use of alcohol, medications, and illicit drugs are also relevant. The history-taking portion of the neurologic assessment is critical and, in many cases of neurologic disease, leads to an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The neurologic examination is a systematic process that includes a variety of clinical tests, observations, and assessments designed to evaluate the neurologic status of a complex system. Many neurologic rating scales exist (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4280">Herndon, 2006</a>), and some of the more common ones are discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The brain and spinal cord cannot be examined as directly as other systems of the body. Therefore, much of the neurologic examination is an indirect evaluation that assesses the function of the specific body part or parts controlled by the nervous system. A neurologic assessment is divided into five components: consciousness and cognition, cranial nerves, motor system, sensory system, and reflexes. One or more components may become the priority assessment, depending on the patient&#x2019;s condition. For example, motor, sensory, and reflex assessments are the priority in patients with spinal injury, whereas in a patient who is comatose, the cranial nerves and level of consciousness become the priority.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Consciousness and Cognition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cerebral abnormalities may cause disturbances in mental status, intellectual functioning, thought content, and emotional status. There may also be alterations in language abilities as well as lifestyle. The examiner must also be aware of the patient&#x2019;s overall level of consciousness and any changes over time (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Posner et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The examiner records and reports specific observations regarding mental status, intellectual function, thought content, and emotional status, all of which permit comparison by others over time. Alterations should be described in specific and nonjudgmental terms. The use of terms such as &#x201C;inappropriate&#x201D; or &#x201C;demented&#x201D; is avoided, because they often mean <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1979" title="1979"></span>different things to different people and are therefore not useful when describing behavior. Analysis and the conclusions that may be drawn from these findings usually depend on the examiner&#x2019;s knowledge of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuropathology.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Mental Status</p>
<p class="nonindent">An assessment of mental status begins by observing the patient&#x2019;s appearance and behavior, noting dress, grooming, and personal hygiene. Posture, gestures, movements, and facial expressions often provide important information about the patient. Does the patient appear to be aware of and interact with the surroundings?</p>
<p class="indent">Assessing orientation to time, place, and person assists in evaluating mental status. Does the patient know what day it is, what year it is, and the name of the president of the United States? Is the patient aware of where they are? Is the patient aware of who the examiner is and of their purpose for being in the room? Assessment of immediate and remote memory is also important. Is the capacity for immediate memory intact?</p>
<p class="h7">Intellectual Function</p>
<p class="nonindent">A person with an average intelligence quotient (IQ) can repeat seven digits without faltering and can recite five digits backward. The examiner might ask the patient to count backward from 100 or to subtract 7 from 100, then 7 from that, and so forth (referred to as serial 7s). The capacity to interpret well-known proverbs tests abstract reasoning, which is a higher intellectual function&#x2014;for example, does the patient know what is meant by &#x201C;a stitch in time saves nine&#x201D;? The intellectual function of patients with damage to the frontal cortex appears intact until one or more tests of intellectual capacity are performed. Questions designed to assess this capacity might include the ability to recognize similarities&#x2014;for example, how are a mouse and dog or pen and pencil alike? Can the patient make judgments about situations&#x2014;for example, if the patient arrives home without a house key, what alternatives are there?</p>
<p class="h7">Thought Content</p>
<p class="nonindent">During the interview, it is important to assess the patient&#x2019;s thought content. Are the patient&#x2019;s thoughts spontaneous, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1980" title="1980"></span>natural, clear, relevant, and coherent? Does the patient have any fixed ideas, illusions, or preoccupations? What are their insights into these thoughts? Preoccupation with death or morbid events, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation are examples of unusual thoughts or perceptions that require further evaluation.</p>
<p class="h7">Emotional Status</p>
<p class="nonindent">An assessment of consciousness and cognition also includes the patient&#x2019;s emotional status. Is the patient&#x2019;s affect (external manifestation of mood) natural and even, or irritable and angry, anxious, apathetic or flat, or euphoric? Does their mood fluctuate normally, or does the patient unpredictably swing from joy to sadness during the interview? Is affect appropriate to words and thought content? Are verbal communications consistent with nonverbal cues?</p>
<p class="h7">Language Ability</p>
<p class="nonindent">The person with normal neurologic function can understand and communicate in spoken and written language. Does the patient answer questions appropriately? Can they read a sentence from a newspaper and explain its meaning? Can the patient write their name or copy a simple figure that the examiner has drawn? A deficiency in language function is called <em>aphasia.</em> Different types of aphasia result from injury to different parts of the brain (see <a href="#tt60-5">Table 60-5</a>). See <a href="c62.xhtml">Chapter 62</a> for a detailed discussion of aphasia.</p>
<p class="h7">Impact on Lifestyle</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses the impact of any impairment on the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle. Issues to consider include the limitations imposed on the patient by any cognitive deficit and the patient&#x2019;s role in society, including family and community roles. The plan of care that the nurse develops needs to address and support adaptation to the neurologic deficit and continued function to the extent possible within the patient&#x2019;s support system.</p>
<p class="h7">Level of Consciousness</p>
<p class="nonindent">Consciousness is the patient&#x2019;s wakefulness and ability to respond to the environment. Level of consciousness is the most sensitive indicator of neurologic function. To assess level of consciousness, the examiner observes for alertness and ability to follow commands.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is not alert or able to follow commands, the examiner observes for eye opening; verbal response and motor response to stimuli, if any; and the type of stimuli needed to obtain a response. Noxious stimuli should be used first, then painful stimuli if no response is observed. In the patient with decreased level of consciousness, motor and cranial nerve functions become the priority assessments, because abnormalities can indicate the area of involvement in the absence of responsiveness. See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for further discussion of changes in level of consciousness.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Examining the Cranial Nerves</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cranial nerves are assessed when level of consciousness is decreased, with brain stem pathology, or in the presence of peripheral nervous system disease (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Right and left cranial nerve functions are compared throughout the examination.</p>
<p class="indent">See <a href="c60-sec01.xhtml#tt60-2">Table 60-2</a> for methods of examining the cranial nerves.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Examining the Motor System</h6>
<p class="h7">Motor Ability</p>
<p class="nonindent">A thorough examination of the motor system includes an assessment of muscle size and tone as well as strength, coordination, and balance. The patient is instructed to walk across the room, if possible, while the examiner observes posture and gait. The muscles are inspected, and palpated if necessary, for their size and symmetry. Any evidence of atrophy or involuntary movements (tremors, tics) is noted. Muscle tone (the tension present in a muscle at rest) is evaluated by palpating various muscle groups at rest and during passive movement. Resistance to these movements is assessed and documented. Abnormalities in tone include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spasticity:&lt;/b&gt; sustained increase in tension of a muscle when it is passively lengthened or stretched">spasticity</button></strong> (increased muscle tone), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rigidity:&lt;/b&gt; increase in muscle tone at rest characterized by increased resistance to passive stretch">rigidity</button></strong> (resistance to passive stretch), and flaccidity.</p>
<p class="h7">Muscle Strength</p>
<p class="nonindent">Assessing the patient&#x2019;s ability to flex or extend the extremities against resistance tests muscle strength. The function of an individual muscle or group of muscles is evaluated by placing the muscle at a disadvantage. The quadriceps, for example, is a powerful muscle responsible for straightening the leg. Once the leg is straightened, it is exceedingly difficult for the examiner to flex the knee. If the knee is flexed and the patient is asked to straighten the leg against resistance, weakness can be elicited. The evaluation of muscle strength compares the sides of the body to each other. For example, the right upper extremity is compared to the left upper extremity. Subtle <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1981" title="1981"></span>differences in strength may be evaluated by testing for drift. For example, both arms are out in front of the patient with palms up; drift is seen as pronation of the palm, indicating a subtle weakness that may not have been detected on the resistance examination.</p>
<p class="indent">Clinicians use a 5-point scale to rate muscle strength. A 5 indicates full power of contraction against gravity and resistance or normal muscle strength; 4 indicates fair but not full strength against gravity and a moderate amount of resistance or slight weakness; 3 indicates just sufficient strength to overcome the force of gravity or moderate weakness; 2 indicates the ability to move but not to overcome the force of gravity or severe weakness; 1 indicates minimal contractile power (weak muscle contraction can be palpated but no movement is noted) or very severe weakness; and 0 indicates no movement (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img class="m" src="images/icon29cma.png" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt">When recording muscle strength, a stick figure is used as a precise form to document findings. The five-point scale is used to rate and record distal and proximal strength in both upper and lower extremities. Figure 60-12 provides further details.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent1">Assessment of muscle strength may be as detailed as necessary. One may quickly test the strength of the proximal muscles of the upper and lower extremities, always assessing both sides by comparing one side to the other. The strength of the finer muscles that control the function of the hand (hand grasp) and the foot (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion) can then be assessed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Balance and Coordination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cerebellar and basal ganglia influence on the motor system is reflected in balance control and coordination. Coordination in the hands and upper extremities is tested by having the patient perform rapid, alternating movements and point-to-point testing. First, the patient is instructed to pat their thigh as fast as possible with each hand separately. Then, the patient is instructed to alternately pronate and supinate the hand as rapidly as possible. Last, the patient is asked to touch each of the fingers with the thumb in a consecutive motion. Speed, symmetry, and degree of difficulty are noted. Point-to-point testing is accomplished by having the patient touch the examiner&#x2019;s extended finger and then their own nose. This is repeated several times.</p>

<p class="indent">Coordination in the lower extremities is tested by having the patient run the heel down the anterior surface of the tibia of the other leg. Each leg is tested in turn. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ataxia:&lt;/b&gt; inability to coordinate muscle movements, resulting in difficulty in walking, talking, and performing self-care activities">Ataxia</button></strong> is an incoordination of voluntary muscle action, particularly of the muscle groups used in activities such as walking or reaching for objects. Tremors (rhythmic, involuntary movements) noted at rest or during movement suggest a problem in the anatomic areas responsible for balance and coordination.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Romberg test:&lt;/b&gt; test for cerebellar dysfunction that can be done with the patient seated or standing; inability to maintain position for 20 seconds is a positive test">Romberg test</button></strong> is a screening test for balance that can be done with the patient seated or standing. The patient can be seated or stand with feet together and arms at the side, first with eyes open and then with both eyes closed for 20 seconds (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The examiner stands close to support the standing patient if they begin to fall. Slight swaying is normal, but a loss of balance is abnormal and is considered a positive Romberg test. Additional cerebellar tests for balance in the patient who is ambulatory include hopping in place, alternating knee bends, and heel-to-toe walking (both forward and backward).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Examining the Sensory System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The sensory system is even more complex than the motor system, because sensory modalities are more widespread throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The sensory examination is largely subjective and requires the cooperation of the patient. The examiner should be familiar with dermatomes that represent the distribution of the peripheral nerves that arise from the spinal cord (see <a href="c60-sec01.xhtml#ff60-9">Fig. 60-9</a>) (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of the sensory system involves tests for tactile sensation, superficial pain, temperature, vibration, and position sense (proprioception). During the sensory assessment, the patient&#x2019;s eyes are closed. Simple directions and reassurance that the examiner will not hurt or startle the patient encourage the cooperation of the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Tactile sensation is assessed by lightly touching a cotton wisp or fingertip to corresponding areas on each side of the body. The sensitivity of proximal parts of the extremities is compared with that of distal parts, and the right and left sides are compared.</p>
<p class="indent">Pain and temperature sensations are transmitted together in the lateral part of the spinal cord, so it is unnecessary to test for temperature sense in most circumstances. Determining the patient&#x2019;s sensitivity to a sharp object can assess superficial pain perception. However, pain sensation is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to or cannot discriminate touch stimulation. The patient is asked to differentiate between the sharp and dull ends of a broken wooden cotton swab or tongue blade; using a safety pin is inadvisable because it breaks the integrity of the skin. Both the sharp and dull sides of the object are applied with equal intensity at all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1982" title="1982"></span>times, and the two sides are compared. In the patient with an altered level of consciousness alternative methods of assessing pain may need to be used (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4293">Poulsen, Brix, Andersen, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Vibration and proprioception are transmitted together in the posterior part of the spinal cord. Vibration may be evaluated through the use of a low-frequency (128 or 256 Hz) tuning fork. The handle of the vibrating fork is placed against a bony prominence, and the patient is asked if a sensation is felt; the patient is then instructed to signal the examiner when the sensation ceases. Common locations used to test for vibratory sense include the distal joint of the great toe and the proximal thumb joint. If the patient does not perceive the vibrations at the distal bony prominences, the examiner progresses upward with the tuning fork until the patient perceives the vibrations. As with all measurements of sensation, a side-to-side comparison is made.</p>
<p class="indent">Position sense or proprioception may be determined by asking the patient to close both eyes and indicate, as the great toe or index finger is alternately moved up and down, in which direction movement has taken place. Vibration and position sense are often lost together, frequently in circumstances in which all other sensation remains intact.</p>
<p class="indent">Integration of sensation in the brain is evaluated by testing two-point discrimination. When the patient is touched with two sharp objects simultaneously, are they perceived as two or as one? If touched simultaneously on opposite sides of the body, the patient should normally report being touched in two places. If only one site is reported, the one not being recognized is said to demonstrate extinction. Another test of higher cortical sensory ability is tactile identification. The patient is instructed to close both eyes and identify an object (e.g., key, coin) that is placed in one hand by the examiner; inability to identify an object by touch is known as tactile agnosia or astereognosis. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;agnosia:&lt;/b&gt; loss of ability to recognize objects through a particular sensory system; may be visual, auditory, or tactile">Agnosia</button></strong> is the general loss of ability to recognize objects through a particular sensory system. The patient can also be shown a familiar object and asked to identify it by name; inability to identify a visualized object is known as visual agnosia. Each of these dysfunctions implicates a different part of the brain (see <a href="#tt60-6">Table 60-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Decreased or absent sensations occur with problems anywhere along the sensory pathway. Sensory deficits resulting from peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord injury follow anatomic dermatomes. Destructive lesions of the brain may affect sensation on an entire side of the body. Stroke affecting a portion of the sensory cortex will produce altered sensory discrimination.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Examining the Reflexes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Reflexes are involuntary contractions of muscles or muscle groups in response to a stimulus. Reflexes are classified as deep tendon, superficial, or pathologic. Testing reflexes enables the examiner to assess involuntary reflex arcs that depend on the presence of afferent stretch receptors, spinal or brain stem synapses, efferent motor fibers, and a variety of modifying influences from higher levels.</p>
<p class="h7">Deep Tendon Reflexes</p>
<p class="nonindent">A reflex hammer is used to elicit a deep tendon reflex. The handle of the hammer is held loosely between the thumb and index finger, allowing a full swinging motion. The wrist motion is similar to that used during percussion. The extremity is positioned so that the tendon is slightly stretched. This requires a sound knowledge of the location of muscles and their tendon attachments. The tendon is then struck briskly (see <a href="#ff60-13">Fig. 60-13</a>), and the response is compared with that on the opposite side of the body. A wide variation in reflex response may be considered normal; however, it is more important that the reflexes be symmetrically equivalent. When the comparison is made, both sides should be equivalently relaxed, and each tendon struck with equal force.</p>
<p class="indent">Valid findings depend on several factors: proper use of the reflex hammer, proper positioning of the extremity, and a patient who is relaxed (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>). If the reflexes are symmetrically diminished or absent, the examiner may use isometric contraction of other muscle groups to increase reflex activity. For example, if lower extremity reflexes are diminished or absent, the patient is instructed to lock the fingers together and pull in opposite directions. Having the patient clench the jaw or press the heels against the floor or examining table may similarly elicit more reliable biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes.</p>
<p class="indent">The absence of reflexes is significant, although ankle jerks (Achilles reflex) may be normally absent in older adults. Deep tendon reflex responses are often graded on a scale of 0 to 4+, with 2+ considered normal (see <a href="#ct60-2">Chart 60-2</a>) but scale ratings are highly subjective. Findings can be recorded as a fraction, indicating the scale range (e.g., 2/4). Some examiners prefer to use the terms <em>present, absent,</em> and <em>diminished</em> when describing reflexes. As with muscle strength recording, a stick figure may be used to record numerical findings.</p>
<p class="h8">Biceps Reflex</p>
<p class="nonindent">The biceps reflex is elicited by striking the biceps tendon over a slightly flexed elbow (see <a href="#ff60-13">Fig. 60-13</a>A). The examiner supports the forearm at the elbow with one arm while placing the thumb against the tendon and striking the thumb with the reflex hammer. The normal response is flexion at the elbow and contraction of the biceps.</p>
<p class="h8">Triceps Reflex</p>
<p class="nonindent">To elicit a triceps reflex, the patient&#x2019;s arm is flexed at the elbow and hanging freely at the side. The examiner supports the patient&#x2019;s arm and identifies the triceps tendon by palpating 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) above the elbow. A direct blow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1983" title="1983"></span>on the tendon (see <a href="#ff60-13">Fig. 60-13</a>B) normally produces contraction of the triceps muscle and extension of the elbow.</p>

<p class="h8">Brachioradialis Reflex</p>
<p class="nonindent">With the patient&#x2019;s forearm resting on the lap or across the abdomen, the brachioradialis reflex is assessed. A gentle strike of the hammer 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) above the wrist results in flexion and supination of the forearm (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Patellar Reflex</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patellar reflex is elicited by striking the patellar tendon just below the patella. The patient may be in a sitting or a lying position. If the patient is supine, the examiner supports the legs to facilitate relaxation of the muscles (see <a href="#ff60-13">Fig. 60-13</a>C). Contractions of the quadriceps and knee extension are normal responses.</p>
<p class="h8">Achilles Reflex</p>
<p class="nonindent">To elicit an Achilles reflex, the foot is dorsiflexed at the ankle and the hammer strikes the stretched Achilles tendon (see <a href="#ff60-13">Fig. 60-13</a>D). This reflex normally produces plantar flexion. If the examiner cannot elicit the ankle reflex and suspects that the patient cannot relax, the patient is instructed to kneel on a chair or similar elevated, flat surface. This position places the ankles in dorsiflexion and reduces any muscle tension in the gastrocnemius. The Achilles tendons are struck in turn, and plantar flexion is usually demonstrated (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Clonus</p>
<p class="nonindent">When reflexes are hyperactive, a movement called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;clonus:&lt;/b&gt; rhythmic contractions of a muscle">clonus</button></strong> may be elicited. If the foot is abruptly dorsiflexed, it may continue to &#x201C;beat&#x201D; two or three times before it settles into a position of rest. Occasionally with CNS system disease, this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1984" title="1984"></span>activity persists, and the foot does not come to rest while the tendon is being stretched but persists in repetitive activity. The unsustained clonus associated with normal but hyperactive reflexes is not considered pathologic. Sustained clonus always indicates the presence of CNS disease and requires further evaluation.</p>

<p class="h7">Superficial Reflexes</p>
<p class="nonindent">The major superficial reflexes include corneal, palpebral, gag, upper/lower abdominal, cremasteric (men only), and perianal. These reflexes are graded differently than the motor reflexes and are noted to be present (+) or absent (&#x2212;). Of these, only the corneal, gag, and plantar reflexes are commonly tested.</p>
<p class="indent">The corneal reflex is tested carefully using a clean wisp of cotton and lightly touching the outer corner of each eye on the sclera. The reflex is present if the action elicits a blink. A stroke or brain injury might result in loss of this reflex, either unilaterally or bilaterally. Loss of this reflex indicates the need for eye protection and possible lubrication to prevent corneal damage.</p>
<p class="indent">The gag reflex is elicited by gently touching the back of the pharynx with a cotton-tipped applicator, first on one side of the uvula and then the other. Positive response is an equal elevation of the uvula and &#x201C;gag&#x201D; with stimulation. Absent response on one or both sides can be seen following a stroke and requires careful evaluation and treatment of the resultant swallowing dysfunction to prevent aspiration of food and fluids.</p>
<p class="h7">Pathologic Reflexes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pathologic reflexes are seen in the presence of neurologic disease; they often represent emergence of earlier reflexes that disappeared with maturity of the nervous system. A pathologic reflex indicative of CNS disease affecting the corticospinal tract is the <strong>Babinski reflex (sign)</strong>. In a person with an intact CNS, if the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot is stroked, the toes contract and draw together. However, in a person who has CNS disease of the motor system, the toes fan out and draw back (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>). This is normal in newborns but represents a serious abnormality in adults. Other pathologic reflexes include the suck (sucking motions in response to touching the lips), snout (lip pursing in response to touching the lips), palmar (grasp in response to stroking the palm), and palmomental (contraction of the facial muscle in response to stimulation of the thenar eminence near the thumb) reflexes in adults. These reflexes often signify progressive nervous system degeneration (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Klein &#x0026; Stewart-Amidei, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2918"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the normal aging process, the nervous system undergoes many changes and is more vulnerable to illness. Age-related changes in the nervous system vary in degree and must be distinguished from those due to disease. It is important for clinicians not to attribute abnormality or dysfunction to aging without appropriate investigation. For example, although diminished strength and agility are a normal part of aging, localized weakness can only be attributed to disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Structural and Physiologic Changes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As the brain ages, neurons are lost, leading to a decrease in the number of synapses and neurotransmitters. This results in slowed nerve conduction and response time. Brain weight decreases, and the ventricle size increases to maintain cranial volume leading to a decreased brain volume. These changes in brain volume accelerate even in healthy people between the ages of 60 and 70 years (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4288">Battaglini, Gentile, Luchetti, et al., 2019</a>). Cerebral blood flow and metabolism are reduced, leading to slower mental functions. Temperature regulation becomes less efficient. In the peripheral nervous system, myelin is lost, resulting in a decrease in conduction velocity in some nerves. Visual and auditory nerves degenerate, leading to loss of visual acuity and hearing. Taste buds atrophy, and nerve cell fibers in the olfactory bulb degenerate (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Jarvis, 2020</a>). Nerve cells in the vestibular system of the inner ear, cerebellum, and proprioceptive pathways also degenerate, leading to balance difficulties. Deep tendon reflexes can be decreased or in some cases absent. Hypothalamic function is modified such that stage IV sleep is reduced. There is an overall slowing of autonomic nervous system responses. Pupillary responses are reduced or may not appear at all in the presence of cataracts.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Motor Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Reduced nerve input into muscle contributes to an overall reduction in muscle bulk, with atrophy most easily noted in the hands. Changes in motor function often result in decreased strength and agility, with increased reaction time. Gait is often slowed and wide based. These changes can create difficulties in maintaining balance, predisposing the older person to falls.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sensory Alterations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tactile sensation is dulled in the older adult due to a decrease in the number of sensory receptors. There may be difficulty in identifying objects by touch, because fewer tactile cues <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1985" title="1985"></span>are received from the bottom of the feet and the person may become confused about body position and location.</p>
<p class="indent">Sensitivity to glare, decreased peripheral vision, and a constricted visual field occur due to degeneration of visual pathways, resulting in disorientation, especially at night when there is little or no light in the room. Because the older adult takes longer to recover visual sensitivity when moving from a light to dark area, nightlights and a safe and familiar arrangement of furniture are essential.</p>
<p class="indent">Loss of hearing can contribute to confusion, anxiety, disorientation, misinterpretation of the environment, feelings of inadequacy, and social isolation. A decreased sense of taste and smell may contribute to weight loss and disinterest in food. A decreased sense of smell may present a safety hazard, because older adults living alone may be unable to detect household gas leaks or fires. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors&#x2014;important in every residence&#x2014;are critical for the older adult.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Temperature Regulation and Pain Perception</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The older adult patient may feel cold more readily than heat and may require extra covering when in bed; a room temperature somewhat higher than usual may be desirable. Reaction to painful stimuli may be decreased with age. Because pain is an important warning signal, caution must be used when hot or cold packs are used. The older patient may be burned or suffer frostbite before being aware of any discomfort. Complaints of pain such as abdominal discomfort or chest pain may be more serious than the patient&#x2019;s perception might indicate and thus require careful evaluation. In older adults, two common pain syndromes that affect the neurologic system are diabetic and postherpetic neuropathies. These frequently occur due to the high rate of these comorbid conditions in older adults. See <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a> for a discussion of diabetic neuropathy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mental Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although mental processing time decreases with age, memory, language, and judgment capacities remain intact. Change in mental status should never be assumed to be a normal part of aging. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;delirium:&lt;/b&gt; an acute, confused state that begins with disorientation and if not recognized and treated early can progress to changes in level of consciousness, irreversible brain damage, and sometimes death">Delirium</button></strong> is an acute confused state that begins with disorientation and if not recognized and treated early can progress to changes in level of consciousness, irreversible brain damage, and sometimes death. Older age is a risk, but delirium is also seen in patients who have underlying CNS damage or are experiencing an acute condition such as infection, adverse medication reaction, or dehydration. Drug toxicity and depression may produce impairment of attention and memory and should be evaluated as a possible cause of mental status change. Assessment with validated screening tool leads to improved detection of delirium (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4295">Smulter, Lingehall, Gustafson, et al., 2019</a>). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a commonly used screening tool (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4291">Inouye, van Dyck, Alessi, et al., 1990</a>) (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="c08-sec03.xhtml#ct8-7">Chart 8-7</a>). Delirium must be differentiated from dementia, which is a chronic and irreversible deterioration of cognitive status. See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, <a href="c61-sec10.xhtml#tt61-4">Table 61-4</a> for further discussion of delirium and dementia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Implications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care for patients with age-related changes to the nervous system and for patients with long-term neurologic disability who are aging should include the modifications described previously. In addition, the consequences of any neurologic deficit and its impact on overall function such as activities of daily living, the use of assistive devices, and individual coping should be assessed and considered in planning patient care. Fall risk must be evaluated and fall prevention measures instituted for the patient who is hospitalized as well as in the home.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must understand the altered responses and the changing needs of the older adult patient before providing education. Visual and hearing deficits require adaptations in activities such as preoperative education, diet therapy, and education about new medications. When using visual materials for education or menu selection, adequate lighting without glare, contrasting colors, and large print are used to offset visual difficulties caused by rigidity and opacity of the lens in the eye and slower pupillary reaction. Procedures and preparations needed for diagnostic tests are explained, taking into account the possibility of impaired hearing and slowed responses in the older adult. Even with hearing loss, the older adult patient often hears adequately if the speaker uses a low-pitched, clear voice; shouting only makes it harder for the patient to understand the speaker. Providing auditory and visual cues aids understanding; if the patient has a significant hearing or visual loss, assistive devices, a signer, an interpreter, or a translator may be needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Providing education at an unrushed pace and using reinforcement enhance learning and retention. Material should be short, concise, and concrete. Vocabulary is matched to the patient&#x2019;s ability, and terms are clearly defined. The older adult patient requires adequate time to receive and respond to stimuli, learn, and react. These measures allow comprehension, memory, and formation of association and concepts.</p>
