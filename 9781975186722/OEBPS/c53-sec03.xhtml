<h4 class="h4" id="s2499">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in men with reproductive disorders. The nurse should educate the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these tests and examinations prior to testing. The nurse should note trends in results because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2500">Prostate-Specific Antigen Test</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The cells within the prostate gland produce a protein that can be measured in the blood called the <strong>prostate-specific antigen (PSA)</strong>. It is a sensitive but not specific test for prostate cancer. In the absence of prostate cancer, serum PSA levels vary with age, race, and prostate volume. Increased levels may indicate prostate cancer. However, a number of other conditions such as BPH, acute urinary retention, and acute prostatitis may cause high PSA levels. Values of PSA may also increase after ejaculation. PSA levels are measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). In most laboratories, values less than 4 ng/mL are generally considered normal, and values greater than 4 ng/mL are considered elevated in men 60 years of age or younger (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3865">Law, Nguyen, Barkin, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Pagana &#x0026; Pagana, 2018</a>). The use of age-specific reference ranges is encouraged to help minimize unnecessary biopsies (see Appendix A on <img src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/>).</p>
<p class="indent">A serum PSA level and a DRE, which are recommended by the ACS (2020), are used to screen for prostate cancer for men with at least a 10-year life expectancy and for men at high risk, including those with a strong family history of prostate cancer and of African American ethnicity. The perceptions of some African American men and women reflect the belief that PSA screening saves lives and needs to be done despite recommendations against screening due to false positives potentially resulting in unnecessary treatment (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3848">Arace, Flores, Monaghan, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3859">Kearns, Adeyemi, Anderson, et al., 2020</a>). The PSA test is also used to monitor patients for recurrence after treatment for cancer of the prostate, based on evidence-based guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2020b). Neither the DRE nor PSA is 100% accurate, but when used together, their accuracy increases.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2501">Ultrasonography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) may be performed in patients with abnormalities detected by DRE and in those with elevated PSA levels. After DRE has been completed, a lubricated, condom-covered, rectal probe transducer is inserted into the rectum (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3867">Lim, Jun, Chang, et al., 2019</a>). Water may be introduced into the condom to help transmit sound waves to the prostate. TRUS may be used in detecting nonpalpable prostate cancers and in staging localized prostate cancer. Needle biopsies of the prostate are commonly guided by TRUS.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2502">Prostate Fluid or Tissue Analysis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Specimens of prostate fluid or tissue may be obtained for culture if disease or inflammation of the prostate gland is suspected. A biopsy of the prostate gland may be necessary to obtain tissue for histologic examination. This may be performed at the time of prostatectomy or by means of a perineal or transrectal needle biopsy. Six to 12 biopsies from all four prostate zones may be obtained during a TRUS-guided biopsy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2503">Tests of Male Sexual Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient cannot engage in sexual activity to his satisfaction, a detailed history is obtained. Nocturnal erections occur in healthy males of all ages. Nocturnal penile tumescence tests may be conducted in a sleep laboratory to monitor changes in penile circumference during sleep using various methods to determine number, duration, rigidity, and circumference of penile erections; the results help identify whether the erectile dysfunction is caused by physiologic or psychological factors. Additional tests, including psychological evaluations, are also part of the diagnostic workup and are usually conducted by a specialized team of health care providers.</p>
