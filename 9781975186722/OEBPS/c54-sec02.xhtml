<h4 class="h4" id="s2564">Statistics on LGBTQ Populations</h4>
<p class="nonindent">There are many challenges to estimating the LGBTQ population in the United States. The biggest challenge is the lack of federal-level data. Historically, the U.S. government has not collected sexual orientation and gender identity data on surveys such as the census count. Consequently, researchers have had to use statistical modeling to estimate LGBTQ population sizes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Williams Institute (2018), a prominent LGBTQ public policy organization, estimates that approximately 4.5% <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1782" title="1782"></span>of the U.S. population is LGBTQ. That percentage translates into nearly 15 million people. Although that number encompasses sexual orientation and gender identity, at least 1 million people in the United States identify as transgender (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3940">Meerwijk &#x0026; Sevelius, 2017</a>). Of the 15 million people who are LGBTQ, 58% identify as female and 42% as male; it is important to note that these survey data did not include nonbinary or gender-fluid gender identity options. The distribution of race and age among the LGBTQ population is shown in <a href="#ff54-1">Figures 54-1</a> and <a href="#ff54-2">54-2</a>, respectively (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3952">The Williams Institute, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Like parents who are heterosexual, parents who are LGBTQ are married, unmarried and cohabiting, separated or divorced, and single. There are intact families and blended families, and children who live between households. There are at least 1.1 million people who are LGBTQ in a legal same-sex marriage, over 1.2 million people who are LGBTQ who are in an unmarried same-sex relationship, and upwards of 3.7&#x00A0;million children under the age of 18 with at least one parent who is LGBTQ (<a href="c54-sec05.xhtml#bib3929">Family Equality Council, 2017</a>). Given the numerous limitations to accurately counting the number of families headed by people who are LGBTQ, these numbers are likely much higher. Also, it is important to note that on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> (576 U.S.) that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry and have their marriages recognized by the states. In the United States, there are over 1000 statutory provisions classified in the U.S. Code that provide benefits, rights, and privileges to legally married couples. This ruling was important to protecting couples who are LGBTQ and their children, especially in the health care setting. For example, marriage allows people to make medical, legal, and financial decisions on behalf of an incapacitated spouse even when the spouse does not designate a durable power of attorney. Without legal marriage, people can be barred from visiting their partner in the hospital. Without marriage, people could not easily cover the health care needs of their entire family with health insurance.</p>
