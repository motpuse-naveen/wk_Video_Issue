<h4 class="h4" id="s1565">Occupation-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders</h4>
<p class="nonindent">According to the U.S. Department of Labor, work-related musculoskeletal disorders (also called <em>ergonomic injuries</em>) are injuries or illnesses of the muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, cartilage, and spinal discs that occur because of exposure to work-related risks. In 2018, sprains, strains, or tears caused the highest incidence of days away from work among private industry workers in all occupations; soreness and pain accounted for the next highest incidence, with a smaller incidence related to fractures, cuts, lacerations, contusions, and bruises (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1566">Occupation-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in Nursing Personnel</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses working in all settings face workplace hazards performing their routines duties. The nursing profession is consistently ranked among the top 10 occupations that are most involved in occupation-related injuries and illnesses that result in lost days of work (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Dressner &#x0026; Kissinger, 2018</a>). Nurses experience a higher-than-average incidence of musculoskeletal disorders that result from overexertion and strain due to heavy workloads and unsafe patient handling techniques. Organizations like the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses (NAON) recognize the seriousness of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among nurses, and advocates for the implementation of evidence-based methods for safe patient handling and movement tasks whenever feasible (see Resources).</p>
