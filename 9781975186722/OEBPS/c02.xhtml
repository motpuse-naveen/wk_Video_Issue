<p class="nonindent">The profession of nursing is ever expanding to meet the health needs of patients, families, and communities. The practice of medical-surgical nursing continues to evolve, too, and is no longer restricted to the traditional environment of the inpatient hospital-based medical-surgical unit. The shift in delivery of medical-surgical nursing from only inpatient settings to also include outpatient settings is a result of multiple factors, including population trends (the growing number of older adults), changes in federal legislation, tighter insurance regulations, and decreasing hospital revenues. Transitions in the health care industry, the nursing profession, and changing patterns of disease and wellness have also affected the shift in care delivery settings. On an increasing basis, hospitals, health care organizations, and providers are held accountable for providing health care using best practices, as evidenced by meeting performance benchmarks for quality and efficiency; this system is known as pay for performance or value-based purchasing. Under this system, hospitals, health care organizations, and providers can reduce costs and earn additional income by carefully monitoring the types of services they provide, discharging patients as soon as possible, and keeping patients who are discharged from the hospital from being readmitted. Consequently, patients who transition from the hospital to the home or to residential or long-term care facilities are in the early stages of recovery. With these changes in health care delivery and accountability, specialty practices under the scope of medical-surgical nursing practice have arisen to further identify evidence-based nursing care and interventions. This chapter provides an overview of medical-surgical nursing and other associated nursing specialty practices.</p>
