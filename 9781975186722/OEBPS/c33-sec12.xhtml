<h4 class="h4" id="s1332">Food Allergy</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Food allergy is an adverse reaction to certain foods due to immunologic mechanisms. Food allergies are categorized as either IgE-mediated or non&#x2013;IgE-mediated allergies. IgE-mediated food allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction, occurs in about 5% of adults. IgE-mediated food allergy is more common and better understood than non&#x2013;IgE-mediated food allergy (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Commins, 2019</a>). Recent studies show that within the population there are many with the misconception that they have a food allergy (19%) compared to persons with true immune-mediated food allergy (10%) (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Gupta, Warren, &#x0026; Smith, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Almost any food can cause an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. Allergic reactions can range from cutaneous urticaria to anaphylaxis. Fish and shellfish (e.g., lobster, shrimp, crab, clams, fin fish) as well as peanuts and tree nuts (e.g., cashew, walnut) are the two food groups that cause the majority of adult food allergies (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2406">Gupta et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Other common foods causing allergy include cow&#x2019;s milk, eggs, soy, and wheat. Allergens are proteins and there is a danger that cross-reactivity can occur in foods containing similar proteins (AAAAI, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">OAS, or pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS or PFS), is the most common form of IgE-mediated food allergy in adults. OAS often occurs in persons who are also allergic to pollen that causes seasonal allergic rhinitis. Raw fruits and vegetables often cause OAS but cooked fruit and vegetables do not (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Burks, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Non&#x2013;IgE-mediated food allergies present as more subacute and/or chronic symptoms that are typically isolated to the gastrointestinal tract and/or skin.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1333">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute urticaria and angioedema (swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, and throat) are the most common clinical manifestations of food allergy. The reaction develops within minutes to hours after eating the offending food. The clinical symptoms may include wheezing, cough, laryngeal edema, and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea). Tree nuts and peanuts can cause the most severe allergic reactions evolving into anaphylaxis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1334">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diagnosis of food allergy requires clinical history, physical examination, trial elimination diets, diet diaries, skin prick testing (SPT), and allergen-specific serum IgE immunoassay. A patch test is used if non&#x2013;IgE-mediated food allergy is suspected. However, the standard is clinician-supervised oral food challenges to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. SPT is used to identify the source of symptoms and assists in identifying specific foods as causative agents. The patient is injected with a minute quantity of food antigen under the skin. Then the patient and primary provider wait to observe if hives and erythema arise within the 15 minute period. If the allergen triggers mast cells to release histamine, a localized wheal will be raised in the skin. A positive skin prick test for IgE-mediated food allergy is diagnosed when a wheal of 3 mm in diameter is raised within 15 minutes. A different kind of test, referred to as a 48-hour atopy patch test, is used for non&#x2013;IgE-mediated food allergy. This is a topical application of food allergen that is applied to the small surface area of skin. This is a delayed reaction that requires 48 hours of observation (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Andreae &#x0026; Schreffler, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1335">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Therapy for food hypersensitivity includes avoidance of the food responsible for the hypersensitivity. Pharmacologic therapy is necessary for patients who cannot avoid exposure to offending foods and for patients with multiple food sensitivities not responsive to avoidance measures. Medication therapy involves the use of H<sub>1</sub> blockers, antihistamines, adrenergic agents, corticosteroids, and cromolyn sodium. All patients with food allergies, especially seafood and nuts, should have an autoinjectable epinephrine device prescribed. Another essential aspect of management is educating patients and family members about how to recognize and manage the early stages of an acute anaphylactic reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Oral immunotherapy (OIT), or tolerance induction, is an increasingly used treatment. The patient ingests very small amounts of the allergen in increasing dosages over several months. OIT is not a curative treatment. The goal of OIT is to increase the threshold that triggers a reaction. OIT can be used to achieve desensitization or sustained unresponsiveness to a food allergen (AAAAI, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, OIT has to be administered in a clinical setting equipped for treatment of potential anaphylaxis. Patients are generally started on a very small daily dose of the food (e.g., 3 to 6 mg of food protein) and advanced periodically (usually every 2 weeks) to a maintenance dose (e.g., 300 mg or, depending on the food and goals, 1 to 2 g of food protein daily) over several months (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Nowak-Wegrzyn, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Peanut, egg, and milk OIT have been shown to desensitize approximately 60% to 80% of patients studied. OIT has not cured food allergy in these individuals; it has raised the patient&#x2019;s tolerance of the offending food. Most children outgrow their allergies to cow&#x2019;s milk, egg, soy and wheat, even if they have a history of a severe reaction. However, peanut, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1062" title="1062"></span>tree nuts, fish, and shellfish allergies tend to persist through adulthood (AAAAI, 2018).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1336">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to participating in management of the allergic reaction, the nurse focuses on preventing future exposure of the patient to the food allergen. The nurse should educate the patient about the signs of anaphylaxis and devise an action plan with the patient. If a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to food allergens has occurred, the nurse must instruct the patient and family about avoidance strategies to prevent its recurrence (see <a href="#ct33-7">Chart 33-7</a>). All patient allergies, including food allergies, should be noted on patient medical records, as dietary restrictions would be necessary in the case of hospitalization. Also, there may be risk of cross-reactivity with some medications containing similar substances. The patient also needs to understand how to select and specify preparation of restaurant food (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Sicherer, 2019</a>).</p>
