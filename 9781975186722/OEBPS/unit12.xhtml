<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps12">Y</span>ou work on an oncology unit and are caring for a 37-year-old woman from Brazil who reported a growing lump on her right breast after it became painful to touch. She is positive for metastatic breast cancer and is admitted for bilateral mastectomy. She is married with two children, ages 6 and 10. The oncologist, radiologist, surgical oncologist, and oncology nurse meet with her to discuss the plan of care. She will need radiation and chemotherapy following the mastectomy. The patient states that she wants &#x201C;everything done,&#x201D; including the use of alternative and complementary therapies her family is sending from her home country. She also states that maintaining her spiritual practices is imperative as part of her healing process. The team discusses how to implement these requests into the plan of care.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
