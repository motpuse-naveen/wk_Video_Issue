<p class="nonindent">The word <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;triage:&lt;/b&gt; process of assessing patients to determine management priorities">triage</button></strong> comes from the French word <em>trier,</em> meaning &#x201C;to sort.&#x201D; In the daily routine of the ED, triage is used to sort patients into groups based on the severity of their health problems and the immediacy with which these problems must be treated.</p>
<p class="indent">A basic and widely used triage system that had been in use for many years utilized three categories: emergent, urgent, and nonurgent. In this system, emergent patients had the highest priority, urgent patients had serious health problems but not immediately life-threatening ones, and nonurgent patients had episodic illnesses.</p>
<p class="indent">A comprehensive, valid, and reliable five-level triage severity rating system that recognizes that EDs are used for both emergency and routine health care is also used. The increased number of triage levels assists the triage nurse to more precisely determine the needs of the patient and the urgency for treatment. Systems that meet these criteria for validity and reliability that are commonly used in the United States are the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) and the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). The ESI assigns patients into five levels, from level 1 (most urgent) to level 5 (least urgent). With the ESI, patients are assigned to triage levels based on both their acuity and their anticipated resource needs (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4674">Soontorn, Sitthimongkol, Thosingha, et al., 2018</a>). The CTAS system&#x2019;s five levels include time parameters that guide how frequently patients must be reassessed by either a nurse or provider. Patients assigned to the <em>resuscitation</em> category must receive continuous nursing surveillance, those in the <em>emergent</em> category must be reassessed at least every 15 minutes, patients in the <em>urgent</em> category must be reassessed at least every 30 minutes, patients in the <em>less urgent</em> category must be reassessed at least every 60 minutes, and those in the <em>nonurgent</em> category must be reassessed at least every 120 minutes. The goal of all triage is rapid assessment and decision making, preferably under 5 minutes (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the ESI and the CTAS are valid and reliable triage severity rating systems, many EDs in the United States have high patient volumes and slow flow. Patients arriving at the ED may experience bottlenecks at triage. To further refine the system, triage bypass moves an incoming patient directly to a bed if open beds are available in the ED. This reduces patient waiting time; the receiving nurse performs the initial assessment and vital signs. In team triage (or provider in triage [PIT]), the triage nurse works with the physician or nurse practitioner or physician assistant within the triage area itself. Team triage can move patients to diagnostics and possibly discharge without full admission to the ED. Both of these additional triage concepts decrease wait time for treatment and improve flow in the ED (ENA, 2020a). The flow of patients within the ED needs to be as efficient as possible so that wait times are diminished, and so that flow is conducive for EMS agencies and for true emergencies.</p>
<p class="indent">Triage is an advanced skill. Emergency nurses spend many hours learning to classify different illnesses and injuries to ensure that patients most in need of care do not needlessly wait. Protocols may be followed to initiate laboratory or x-ray studies while the patient is in the triage area. Collaborative protocols are developed and used by the triage nurse based on their level of experience (ENA, 2018a). Nurses in the triage area collect additional crucial baseline data: full vital signs including pain assessment, history of the current event and past medical history, neurologic assessment findings, weight, allergies (especially to latex and medications), intimate partner violence screening, and necessary diagnostic data. Asking questions is key to appropriate triage decisions. The following questions reflect the minimum information that should be obtained from the patient or from the person who accompanied the patient to the ED (so long as that person is not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2186" title="2186"></span>suspected of abuse or neglect; see later discussion) and then are documented (ENA, 2020a):</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>What were the circumstances, precipitating events, location, and time of the injury or illness?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>When did the symptoms appear?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Was the patient unconscious after the injury or onset of illness?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>How did the patient get to the ED?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>What was the health status of the patient before the injury or illness?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Is there a history of medical illness or previous surgeries? A history of admissions to the hospital?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Is the patient currently taking any medications, especially hormones, insulin, digitalis, or anticoagulants? Is the patient using any complementary or alternative therapies such as herbology, naturopathy, Reiki, massage, or acupuncture?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Does the patient have any allergies, especially to latex, medications, eggs, or nuts?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Does the patient use tobacco products or recreational drugs? How frequently? What type? When was the last time they were used?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Does the patient have any fears? Does the patient feel in danger or in an unsafe situation?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>When was the last meal eaten? (This is important if general anesthesia is to be given or if the patient is unconscious.)</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>When was the last menstrual period?</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Is the patient under a provider&#x2019;s care? What is the name and contact information for the provider?</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>What was the date of the patient&#x2019;s most recent tetanus immunization?</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the collection of initial vital signs and medical history, triage consists of providing basic first aid, which may include application of ice, bleeding control, and basic wound care, as well as initiating protocol-based prescriptions (e.g., x-rays, administering antipyretic or mild analgesic agents, obtaining an electrocardiogram [ECG] or urinalysis, removing sutures). The triage nurse also is responsible for and monitors the waiting area, maintains a safe environment, reassesses patients who are waiting, and is the initial liaison to the families of patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Routine ED triage protocols differ significantly from the triage protocols used in disasters and mass casualty incidents (field triage). Routine triage directs all available resources to the patients who are most critically ill, regardless of potential outcome. In field triage (or hospital triage during a disaster), scarce resources must be used to benefit the most people possible (ENA, 2020a). This distinction affects triage decisions (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3200"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtv1.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to decrease the spread of infection and properly screen and triage all patients presenting to the ED for infection with or exposure to SARS-CoV-2. All patients should enter the ED with a face covering, which may be cloth, and maintain social distance restrictions away from other patients of 6 feet, if possible. If possible, patients should monitor their own temperature prior to arrival to the ED and notify the ED staff if they are experiencing any of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. These include (CDC, 2020c):</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Fever or chills</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Cough</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Fatigue</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Headache</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Sore throat</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Diarrhea</p>
<p class="indent">It is also important that all patients who present to the ED are screened to find if they have traveled to areas with a high prevalence of COVID-19, or been exposed to others suspected or known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the last 2 weeks. Patients who are asymptomatic and without any possible exposure within the past 2 weeks should be triaged to a designated area away from those patients who are symptomatic or were likely exposed (CDC, 2020c).</p>
