<h4 class="h4" id="s3227">Heat-Induced Illnesses</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Heat-induced illnesses may range in severity from mild and self-limiting to life-threatening emergencies. The most serious of these&#x2014;heat stroke&#x2014;is an acute medical emergency caused by failure of the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body. It is the inability to maintain cardiac output in the face of moderately high body temperatures and is associated with dehydration. The most common cause of heat stroke is nonexertional, prolonged exposure to an environmental temperature of greater than 39.2&#x00B0;C (102.5&#x00B0;F), although a heat index of greater than 35&#x00B0;C (95&#x00B0;F) is associated with increased mortality (ENA, 2020a). It usually occurs during extended heat waves, especially when they are accompanied by high humidity. Exertional heat stroke is caused by strenuous physical activity that occurs in a hot environment (ENA, 2020a).</p>

<p class="Box15pTitle"><strong>Preventing Heat-Induced Illnesses</strong></p>
<p class="Box15pPARA">The nurse provides the following advice for the patient treated for heat-induced illness:</p>
<p class="Box15BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid immediate re-exposure to high temperatures; hypersensitivity to high temperatures may remain for a considerable time.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Maintain adequate fluid intake, wear loose clothing, and reduce activity in hot weather.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Monitor fluid losses and weight loss during workout activities or exercise and replace fluids and electrolytes.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use a gradual approach to physical conditioning, allowing sufficient time for return to baseline temperature.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Plan outdoor activities to avoid the hottest part of the day (between 10 <span class="small">AM</span> and 2 <span class="small">PM</span>).</p>
<p class="Box15pPARApIndent">For older patients living in urban settings with high environmental temperatures:</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The nurse directs these patients to places where air conditioning is available (e.g., shopping mall, library, church) and advises them that fans alone are not adequate to prevent heat-induced illness.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">People at risk for nonexertional heat stroke are those not acclimatized to heat, those who are older or very young, those unable to care for themselves, those with chronic and debilitating diseases, and those taking certain medications (e.g., major tranquilizers, anticholinergics, diuretics, beta-blockers) (ENA, 2020a; Tintinalli, Stapczyski, Ma, et al., 2020). Older adults, the very young, people with mental illness, and people with chronic diseases have the highest rates of mortality (CDC, 2017a). Exertional heat stroke occurs in healthy individuals during sports or work activities (e.g., exercising in extreme heat and humidity). Hyperthermia results because of inadequate heat loss. Strategies used to prevent heat-induced illnesses are reviewed in <a href="#ct67-6">Chart 67-6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Less severe forms of heat-induced illnesses include heat exhaustion and heat illness or heat cramps. The causes of heat exhaustion are the same as for heat stroke. Heat illness is caused by a loss of electrolytes, typically during strenuous physical activity in a hot environment (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3228"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most heat-related deaths occur in older adults because their circulatory systems are unable to compensate for stress imposed by heat. Older adults have a decreased ability to perspire as well as a decreased ability to vasodilate and vasoconstrict. They have less subcutaneous tissue, a decreased thirst mechanism, and a diminished ability to concentrate urine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2197" title="2197"></span>to compensate for heat. Many older adults do not drink adequate amounts of fluid, partly because of fear of incontinence, and thus have a greater risk of heat stroke. In addition, many older adults fear being victims of crime, so even if their residence lacks air conditioning, they tend to keep windows closed despite high temperatures and humidity levels (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3229">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Heat stroke, whether the cause is exertional or nonexertional, causes thermal injury at the cellular level, resulting in coagulopathies and widespread damage to the heart, liver, and kidneys. Recent patient history reveals exposure to elevated ambient temperature or excessive exercise during extreme heat. When assessing the patient, the nurse notes the following symptoms: profound central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (manifested by confusion, delirium, bizarre behavior, coma, seizures); elevated body temperature (40.6&#x00B0;C [105&#x00B0;F] or higher); hot, dry skin; and usually anhidrosis (absence of sweating), tachypnea, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient with heat exhaustion, on the other hand, may exhibit similarly high body temperatures accompanied by headaches, anxiety, syncope, profuse diaphoresis, gooseflesh, and orthostasis. The cardinal manifestations of heat illness include muscle cramps, particularly in the shoulders, abdomen, and lower extremities; profound diaphoresis; and profound thirst (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3230">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The main goal is to reduce the high body temperature as quickly as possible, because mortality in heat stroke or morbid progression to heat stroke with less serious forms of heat-induced illnesses is directly related to the duration of hyperthermia. For the patient with heat stroke, simultaneous treatment focuses on stabilizing oxygenation using the CABs (<em>C</em>irculation, <em>A</em>irway, and <em>B</em>reathing) of basic life support. This includes establishing IV access for fluid administration.</p>
<p class="indent">After the patient&#x2019;s clothing is removed, the core (internal) temperature is reduced to 39&#x00B0;C (102&#x00B0;F) as rapidly as possible, preferably within 1 hour. One or more of the following methods may be used as prescribed (ENA, 2020a):</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Cool sheets and towels or continuous sponging with cool water</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Ice applied to the neck, groin, chest, and axillae while spraying with tepid water</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Cooling blankets</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Immersion of the patient in a cold water bath is the optimal method for cooling (if available)</p>
<p class="indent">During cooling procedures, an electric fan is positioned so that it blows on the patient to augment heat dissipation by convection and evaporation. The patient&#x2019;s temperature is constantly monitored with a thermistor placed in the rectum, bladder, or esophagus to evaluate core temperature. Caution is used to avoid hypothermia and to prevent hyperthermia, which may recur spontaneously within 3 to 4 hours. The cooling process should stop at 38&#x00B0;C (100.4&#x00B0;F) in order to avoid iatrogenic hypothermia (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout treatment, the patient&#x2019;s status is monitored carefully, including vital signs, ECG findings (for possible myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias), central venous pressure (CVP), and level of responsiveness, all of which may change with rapid alterations in body temperature. A seizure may be followed by recurrence of hyperthermia. To meet tissue needs exaggerated by the hypermetabolic condition, 100% oxygen is given. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to support failing cardiopulmonary systems may be required.</p>
<p class="indent">IV infusion therapy of normal saline or lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution is initiated as directed to replace fluid losses and maintain adequate circulation. Fluids are given carefully because of the dangers of myocardial injury from high body temperature and poor kidney function. Cooling redistributes fluid volume from the periphery to the core.</p>
<p class="indent">Urine output is also measured frequently, because ATN may occur as a complication of heat stroke from rhabdomyolysis (see previous discussion). Blood specimens are obtained for serial testing to detect bleeding disorders, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and for serial enzyme studies to estimate thermal hypoxic injury to the liver, heart, and muscle tissue. Permanent liver, cardiac, and CNS damage may occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Additional supportive care may include dialysis for AKI, anticonvulsant medications to control seizures, potassium for hypokalemia, and sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam may be prescribed to suppress seizure activity, while a phenothiazine such as chlorpromazine may be prescribed to suppress shivering (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with heat exhaustion or heat illness may be managed less aggressively. These patients should lie supine in a cool environment. Patients with heat exhaustion may require IV fluids but may also take oral fluids, if they are tolerated. Patients with heat illness are given oral sodium supplements and oral electrolyte solutions (ENA, 2020a). Patients who have experienced a heat-induced illness should receive education to prevent another heat-related illness (see Chart&#x00A0;67-6).</p>
