<h4 class="h4" id="s628">Pneumonia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. <em>Pneumonitis</em> is a more general term that describes an inflammatory process in the lung tissue that may predispose or place the patient at risk for microbial invasion. Pneumonia and influenza are the most common causes of death from infectious diseases in the United States. Pneumonia and influenza accounted for 55,672 deaths in the United States in 2017 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017a). Together, these diseases were the eighth leading cause of death in the United States in 2017, accounting for 5.9% of all deaths (CDC, 2017a).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s629">Classification</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pneumonia can be classified into four types: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), health care&#x2013;associated pneumonia (HCAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (American Thoracic Society &#x0026; Infectious Diseases Society of America, 2005; Klompas, 2019a). HCAP was conceived as a specific category in order to identify patients at increased risk for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) versus community-acquired organisms (Klompas, 2019a). <a href="#ct19-4">Chart&#x00A0;19-4</a> describes the different classifications and definitions of pneumonias. Other subcategories of HCAPs are those in the immunocompromised host and aspiration pneumonia. There is overlap in how specific pneumonias are classified, because they may occur in differing settings. Risk factors associated for specific pathogens are shown in <a href="#ct19-5">Chart&#x00A0;19-5</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Community-Acquired Pneumonia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">CAP, a common infectious disease, occurs either in the community setting or within the first 48 hours after hospitalization or institutionalization. The need for hospitalization for CAP depends on the severity of the pneumonia. The causative pathogens for CAP by site of care are shown in Table&#x00A0;19-1. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page532" title="532"></span>The specific etiologic pathogen is identified in about 50% of cases. The rate of CAP increases with age, with 2000 per 100,000 adults 65 years of age and older hospitalized with CAP each year (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Ramirez, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><em>S. pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus) is the most common bacterial cause of CAP in people younger than 60 years without comorbidity and in those 60 years and older with comorbidity (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Baer, 2019</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Ramirez, 2019</a>). <em>S. pneumoniae,</em> a gram-positive organism that resides naturally in the upper respiratory tract, colonizes the upper respiratory tract and can cause disseminated invasive infections, pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections, and upper respiratory tract infections such as otitis media and rhinosinusitis. It may occur as a lobar or bronchopneumonic form in patients of any age and may follow a recent respiratory illness.</p>

Retrieved on 9/23/2019 at: <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/print">www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/print</a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><em>H. influenzae</em> causes a type of CAP that frequently affects older adults and those with comorbid illnesses (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], alcoholism, diabetes). The presentation is indistinguishable from that of other forms of bacterial CAP and may be subacute, with cough or low-grade fever for weeks before diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Mycoplasma pneumonia is caused by <em>M. pneumoniae.</em> Mycoplasma pneumonia is spread by infected respiratory droplets through person-to-person contact. Patients can be tested for mycoplasma antibodies. The inflammatory infiltrate is primarily interstitial rather than alveolar. It spreads throughout the entire respiratory tract, including the bronchioles, and has the characteristics of a bronchopneumonia. Earache and bullous myringitis are common. Impaired ventilation and diffusion may occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and children. Until the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, viruses were relatively uncommon causes of CAP in adults (see later discussion). Pre-COVID-19, cytomegalovirus was the most commonly implicated viral pathogen in adults with compromised immune systems, followed by herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The acute stage of a viral respiratory infection occurs within the ciliated cells of the airways, followed by infiltration of the tracheobronchial tree. With pneumonia, the inflammatory process extends into the alveolar area, resulting in edema and exudation. The clinical signs and symptoms of a viral pneumonia are often difficult to distinguish from those of a bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Health Care&#x2013;Associated Pneumonia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An important distinction of HCAP is that the causative pathogens are often MDROs because of prior contact with a health care environment. Consequently, identifying this type of pneumonia in areas such as the emergency department is crucial. Because HCAP is often difficult to treat, initial antibiotic treatment must not be delayed. Initial antibiotic treatment of HCAP is often different from that for CAP due to the possibility of MDROs (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Ramirez, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">HAP develops 48 hours or more after hospitalization and does not appear to be incubating at the time of admission. VAP can be considered a subtype of HAP, as the only differentiating factor is the presence of an ET tube (see later discussion of VAP). Certain factors may predispose patients to HAP because of impaired host defenses (e.g., severe acute or chronic illness), a variety of comorbid conditions, supine positioning and aspiration, coma, malnutrition, prolonged hospitalization, hypotension, metabolic disorders. Hospitalized patients are also exposed to potential bacteria from other sources (e.g., respiratory therapy devices and equipment, transmission of pathogens by the hands of health care personnel). Numerous intervention-related factors also may play a role in the development of HAP (e.g., therapeutic agents leading to central nervous system depression with decreased ventilation, impaired removal of secretions, or potential <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page533" title="533"></span>aspiration; prolonged or complicated thoracoabdominal procedures, which may impair mucociliary function and cellular host defenses; ET intubation [VAP]; prolonged or inappropriate use of antibiotics; the use of nasogastric tubes). In addition, patients with compromised immune systems are at particular risk. HAP is associated with a high mortality rate, in part because of the virulence of the organisms, the resistance to antibiotics, and the patient&#x2019;s underlying disorder. It is the most common cause of death among all patients with hospital-acquired infections, with mortality rates up to 33% (Cunha, 2018; Klompas, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">The common organisms responsible for HAP include the <em>Enterobacter</em> species, <em>Escherichia coli, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter</em> species, methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), and <em>S. pneumoniae.</em> Most patients with HAP are colonized by multiple organisms. Pseudomonal pneumonia occurs in patients who are debilitated, those with altered mental status, and those with prolonged intubation or with tracheostomy. Staphylococcal pneumonia can occur through inhalation of the organism or spread through the hematogenous route. It is often accompanied by sepsis and positive blood cultures. Its mortality rate is high. Specific strains of staphylococci are resistant to many available antimicrobial agents; notable exceptions include vancomycin and linezolid (Klompas, 2019b). Overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents are major risk factors for the emergence of these resistant pathogens. Because MRSA is highly virulent, steps must be taken to prevent its spread. Patients with MRSA are isolated in a private room, and contact precautions (gown, gloves, and antibacterial soap or alcohol-based hand rub) are used. The number of people in contact with affected patients is minimized, and appropriate precautions must be taken when transporting these patients within or between facilities.</p>
<p class="indent">The usual presentation of HAP is a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray combined with evidence of infection such as fever, respiratory symptoms, purulent sputum, or leukocytosis. Pneumonias from <em>Klebsiella</em> or other gram-negative organisms are characterized by the destruction of lung structure and alveolar walls, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;consolidation:&lt;/b&gt; lung tissue that has become more solid in nature due to collapse of alveoli or infectious process (pneumonia)">consolidation</button></strong> (tissue that solidifies as a result of collapsed alveoli or infectious process such as pneumonia), and sepsis. Older adult patients and those with alcoholism, chronic lung disease, or diabetes are at increased risk (Klompas, 2019a). Development of a cough or increased cough and sputum production are common presentations, along with low-grade fever and general malaise. In patients who are debilitated or dehydrated, sputum production may be minimal or absent. Pleural effusion, high fever, and tachycardia are common.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As noted previously, VAP can be thought of as a subtype of HAP; however, in such cases, the patient has been endotracheally intubated and has received mechanical ventilatory support for at least 48 hours (see later discussions on ET intubation and mechanical ventilation). VAP is a complication in as many as 27% of patient who require mechanical ventilation (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Gamache, 2019</a>). The incidence of VAP increases with the duration of mechanical ventilation and the mortality rate is variable, depending upon the complexity of the underlying illness. The etiologic bacteriologic agents associated with VAP typically differ based on the timing of the occurrence of the infection relative to the start of mechanical ventilation. VAP occurring within 96 hours of the onset of mechanical ventilation is usually due to antibiotic-sensitive bacteria that colonize the patient prior to hospital admission, whereas VAP developing after 96 hours of ventilatory support is more often associated with MDROs. Prevention remains the key to reducing the burden of VAP (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Klompas, File, &#x0026; Bond, 2019</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1547">Timsit, Esaied, Neuville, et al., 2017</a>). See <a href="#ct19-6">Chart&#x00A0;19-6</a> for an overview of bundled interventions aimed at preventing VAP.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pneumonia in the Immunocompromised Host</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Due to advances in immunosuppressive therapy, prevalence of MDROs, and improvements in diagnostic studies, there is an increased incidence of pneumonia in patients who are immunocompromised. Common causative organisms include <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP), fungal pneumonias, and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</em> The organism that causes PCP is now known as <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> instead of <em>Pneumocystis carinii.</em> The acronym PCP still applies because it can be read &#x201C;<strong><em>P</em></strong><em>neumo</em><strong><em>c</em></strong><em>ystis</em> <strong>p</strong>neumonia.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Pneumonia in the immunocompromised host can occur with the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, nutritional depletion, the use <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page534" title="534"></span>of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), genetic immune disorders, and long-term advanced life support technology (mechanical ventilation). It is seen with increasing frequency because affected patients constitute a growing portion of the population; however, pneumonias that typically occur in people who are immunocompromised may also occur in those who are immunocompetent. Pneumonia carries a higher morbidity and mortality rate in patients who are immunocompromised than in those who are immunocompetent (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Zhao &#x0026; Shin, 2019</a>). Patients with compromised immune systems commonly develop pneumonia from organisms of low virulence. In addition, increasing numbers of patients with impaired defenses develop HAP from gram-negative bacilli (<em>Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, E. coli,</em> Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Proteus, Serratia</em>) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Zhao &#x0026; Shin, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Whether patients are immunocompromised or immunocompetent, the clinical presentation of pneumonia is similar. PCP has a subtle onset, with progressive dyspnea, fever, and a nonproductive cough.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Aspiration Pneumonia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aspiration pneumonia refers to the pulmonary consequences resulting from entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway. The most common form of aspiration pneumonia is bacterial infection from aspiration of bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways. Aspiration pneumonia may occur in the community or hospital setting. Common pathogens are anaerobes, <em>S. aureus, Streptococcus</em> species, and gram-negative bacilli (Bartlett, 2019a). Substances other than bacteria may be aspirated into the lung, such as gastric contents, exogenous chemical contents, or irritating gases. This type of aspiration or ingestion may impair the lung defenses, cause inflammatory changes, and lead to bacterial growth and a resulting pneumonia (see later discussion of aspiration).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s630">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Normally, the upper airway prevents potentially infectious particles from reaching the sterile lower respiratory tract. Pneumonia arises from normal flora present in patients whose resistance has been altered or from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx; patients often have an acute or chronic underlying disease that impairs host defenses. Pneumonia may also result from bloodborne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed.</p>
<p class="indent">Pneumonia affects both ventilation and diffusion. An inflammatory reaction can occur in the alveoli, producing an exudate that interferes with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. White blood cells, mostly neutrophils, also migrate into the alveoli and fill the normally air-filled spaces. Areas of the lung are not adequately ventilated because of secretions and mucosal edema that cause partial occlusion of the bronchi or alveoli, with a resultant decrease in alveolar oxygen tension. Bronchospasm may also occur in patients with reactive airway disease. Because of hypoventilation, a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ventilation&#x2013;perfusion (V./Q.):&lt;/b&gt; refers to the ratio between ventilation and perfusion in the lung; matching of ventilation to perfusion optimizes gas exchange">ventilation&#x2013;perfusion</button></strong> (V./Q.) mismatch occurs in the affected area of the lung. V./Q. refers to the ratio between ventilation and perfusion in the lung, which is normally approximately 4 to 5, or 0.8; matching of ventilation to perfusion optimizes gas exchange. Venous blood entering the pulmonary circulation passes through the underventilated area and travels to the left side of the heart poorly oxygenated. The mixing of oxygenated and unoxygenated or poorly oxygenated blood eventually results in arterial hypoxemia.</p>
<p class="indent">If a substantial portion of one or more lobes is involved, the disease is referred to as lobar pneumonia. The term <em>bronchopneumonia</em> is used to describe pneumonia that is distributed in a patchy fashion, having originated in one or more localized areas within the bronchi and extending to the adjacent surrounding lung parenchyma. Bronchopneumonia is more common than lobar pneumonia (see <a href="#ff19-2">Fig.&#x00A0;19-2</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff19-2">

In bronchopneumonia (<em>left</em>), patchy areas of consolidation occur. In lobar pneumonia (<em>right</em>), an entire lobe is consolidated.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s631">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Being knowledgeable about the factors and circumstances that commonly predispose people to pneumonia helps identify patients at high risk for the disease (Bartlett, 2019a). <a href="#tt19-2">Table&#x00A0;19-2</a> describes risk factors for pneumonia; additional risk factors are travel or exposure to certain environments and residence in a long-term care facility. Increasing numbers of patients who have compromised defenses against infections are susceptible to pneumonia. Some types of pneumonia, such as those caused by viral infections, occur in previously healthy people, often after a viral illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Pneumonia occurs in patients with certain underlying disorders such as heart failure, diabetes, alcoholism, COPD, and AIDS (Klompas, 2019a). Certain diseases also have been associated with specific pathogens. For example, staphylococcal pneumonia has been noted after epidemics of influenza, and patients with COPD are at increased risk for development of pneumonia caused by pneumococci or <em>H. influenzae.</em> In addition, cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory infection caused by pseudomonal and staphylococcal organisms, and PCP has been associated with AIDS. Pneumonias occurring in hospitalized patients often involve organisms not usually found in CAP, including enteric gram-negative bacilli and <em>S. aureus.</em></p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s632">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pneumonia varies in its signs and symptoms depending on the type, causal organism, and presence of underlying disease. However, it is not possible to diagnose a specific form or classification of pneumonia by clinical manifestations alone. The patient with streptococcal (pneumococcal) pneumonia usually has a sudden onset of chills, rapidly rising fever (38.5&#x00B0; to 40.5&#x00B0;C [101&#x00B0; to 105&#x00B0;F]), and pleuritic chest pain that is aggravated by deep breathing and coughing. The patient is severely ill, with marked tachypnea (25 to 45 breaths/min), accompanied by other signs of respiratory distress (e.g., shortness of breath and the use of accessory muscles in respiration) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Weinberger, Cockrill, &#x0026; Mandel, 2019</a>). A relative bradycardia (a pulse&#x2013;temperature deficit in which the pulse is slower than that expected for a given temperature) may suggest viral infection, mycoplasma infection, or infection with a <em>Legionella</em> organism.</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients exhibit an upper respiratory tract infection (nasal congestion, sore throat), and the onset of symptoms of pneumonia is gradual and nonspecific. The predominant symptoms may be headache, low-grade fever, pleuritic pain, myalgia, rash, and pharyngitis. After a few days, mucoid or mucopurulent sputum is expectorated. In severe pneumonia, the cheeks are flushed and the lips and nail beds demonstrate central cyanosis (a late sign of hypoxemia).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may exhibit <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orthopnea:&lt;/b&gt; shortness of breath when lying flat; relieved by sitting or standing">orthopnea</button></strong> (shortness of breath when reclining or in the supine position), preferring to be propped up or sitting in bed leaning forward (orthopneic position) in an effort to achieve adequate gas exchange without coughing or breathing deeply. Appetite is poor, and the patient is diaphoretic and tires easily. Sputum is often purulent; however, this is not a reliable indicator of the etiologic agent. Rusty, blood-tinged sputum may be expectorated with streptococcal (pneumococcal), staphylococcal, and <em>Klebsiella</em> pneumonia.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 535</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page536" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="536">p. 536</span></div>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may also depend on a patient&#x2019;s underlying condition. Different signs occur in patients with conditions such as cancer, and in those who are undergoing treatment with immunosuppressant medications, which decrease the resistance to infection. Such patients have fever, crackles, and physical findings that indicate consolidation of lung tissue, including increased tactile fremitus (vocal vibration detected on palpation), percussion dullness, bronchial breath sounds, egophony (when auscultated, the spoken &#x201C;E&#x201D; becomes a loud, nasal-sounding &#x201C;A&#x201D;), and whispered pectoriloquy (whispered sounds are easily auscultated through the chest wall). These changes occur because sound is transmitted better through solid or dense tissue (consolidation) than through normal air-filled tissue; these sounds are described in <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Purulent sputum or slight changes in respiratory symptoms may be the only sign of pneumonia in patients with COPD. Determining whether an increase in symptoms is an exacerbation of the underlying disease process or an additional infectious process may be difficult.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s633">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of pneumonia is made by history (particularly of a recent respiratory tract infection), physical examination, chest x-ray, blood culture (bloodstream invasion [bacteremia] occurs frequently), and sputum examination. The sputum sample is obtained by having patients rinse the mouth with water to minimize contamination by normal oral flora, breathe deeply several times, cough deeply, and expectorate the raised sputum into a sterile container.</p>
<p class="indent">More invasive procedures may be used to collect specimens. Sputum may be obtained by nasotracheal or orotracheal suctioning with a sputum trap or by fiberoptic bronchoscopy (see <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>). Bronchoscopy is often used in patients with acute severe infection, in patients with chronic or refractory infection, in patients with compromised immune systems when a diagnosis cannot be made from an expectorated or induced specimen, and in patients who are mechanically ventilated. Bronchoscopic techniques may include a protected brush specimen or bronchoalveolar lavage.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s634">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pneumococcal vaccination reduces the incidence of pneumonia, hospitalizations for cardiac conditions, and deaths in the older adult population. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccine recommended for adults: a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) (CDC, 2017c).</p>
<p class="indent">PCV13 protects against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. PCV13 is recommended for all adults 65 years of age or older as well as adults 19 years or older with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV infection, organ transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, chronic kidney disease, and asplenism, or with cerebrospinal fluid leak or with cochlear implants (CDC, 2017b). PPSV23 is a newer vaccine and protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. It is recommended for all adults 65 years of age or older and for those adults 19 through 64 years of age who smoke cigarettes or who have chronic heart, lung, or liver disease, or alcoholism (CDC, 2017b). Most patients who have previously received PCV13 should receive PPSV23. In particular, all adults 65 years of age or older who previously received the PCV13 should receive the PPSV23 vaccine. For immunocompetent adults age 65 or older who have not received PCV13, a dose of PCV13 should be given followed by PPSV23 at least 1 year later. These two vaccines should not be co-administered (CDC, 2017b). As pneumococcal vaccination guidelines may change from year to year, it is important to consult the CDC web site for the most current recommendations. Other preventive measures are summarized in <a href="#tt19-2">Table&#x00A0;19-2</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s635">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of patients with pneumonia includes prescribing appropriate antibiotics for bacterial pneumonias; assisting the patient to get adequate rest and hydration; and managing complications if they occur. In some patients, supplemental oxygenation may be prescribed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment of pneumonia includes administration of the appropriate antibiotic as determined by the results of a culture and sensitivity. However, the causative organism is not identified in half of CAP cases when therapy is initiated (File, 2019b). Guidelines are used to guide antibiotic choice; however, the resistance patterns, prevalence of causative organisms, patient risk factors, treatment setting (inpatient vs. outpatient), and costs and availability of newer antibiotic agents must all be considered. See <a href="#tt19-3">Table&#x00A0;19-3</a> for the treatment of patients with pneumonia due to specific pathogens.</p>
<p class="indent">Inpatients should be switched from intravenous (IV) to oral therapy when they are hemodynamically stable, are improving clinically, are able to take medications/fluids by mouth, and have a normally functioning gastrointestinal tract. As soon as patients are clinically stable, have no medical problems, and have a safe environment for continued care, they should be discharged from the hospital. Clinical stability is defined as temperature less than or equal to 37.8&#x00B0;C (100&#x00B0;F), heart rate less than or equal to 100 bpm, respiratory rate less than or equal to 24 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 90%, with ability to maintain oral intake and normal (baseline) mental status.</p>

<p class="indent">In suspected HAP, treatment is usually initiated with a broad-spectrum IV antibiotic and may be monotherapy or combination therapy. For patients with no known multidrug resistance, monotherapy with ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam, levofloxacin, or ertapenem is used. With known multidrug resistance, a three-drug combination therapy may be used; this drug regimen may include an antipseudomonal cephalosporin or ceftazidime or antipseudomonal carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam plus antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside plus linezolid or vancomycin. The patient&#x2019;s status must be assessed 72 hours after the initiation of therapy, and antibiotics should be discontinued or modified based on the culture results. Of concern is the rampant rise in respiratory pathogens that are resistant to available antibiotics. Examples include vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), MRSA, and drug-resistant <em>S. pneumoniae.</em> Providers tend to prescribe antibiotics aggressively in the presence of suspected infection. Mechanisms to monitor and minimize the inappropriate use of antibiotics are in place. In response to antibiotic resistant organisms, the CDC recommends all acute care hospitals participate in an antibiotic stewardship program (CDC, 2019b). Antibiotic stewardship refers to a set of coordinated strategies to improve the use of antimicrobial medications with the goal of enhancing patient health outcomes, reducing resistance to antibiotics, and decreasing unnecessary costs (CDC, 2019a; Nathwani, Varghese, Stephens, et al., 2019). Education of clinicians about the use of evidence-based guidelines in the treatment of respiratory infection is important, and some institutions have implemented algorithms to assist clinicians in choosing the appropriate antibiotics. Monitoring and surveillance of susceptibility patterns for pathogens are also important.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Therapeutic Regimens</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Antibiotics are ineffective in viral upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonias, and their use may be associated with adverse effects. Antibiotics are indicated with a viral respiratory infection <em>only</em> if a secondary bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, or rhinosinusitis is present. With the exception of the use of antimicrobial therapy, treatment of viral pneumonia is generally the same as that for bacterial pneumonia; however, different treatments have been used for the patient who develops pneumonia as a result of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virion implicated in COVID-19 (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>) (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of viral pneumonia is primarily supportive. Hydration is a necessary part of therapy, because fever and tachypnea may result in insensible fluid losses. Antipyretic agents may be used to treat headache and fever; antitussive medications may be used for the associated cough. Warm, moist inhalations are helpful in relieving bronchial irritation. Antihistamines may provide benefit with reduced sneezing and rhinorrhea. Nasal decongestants may also be used to treat symptoms and improve sleep; however, excessive use can cause rebound nasal congestion. Bed rest is prescribed until the infection shows signs of clearing. If hospitalized, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page540" title="540"></span>the patient is observed carefully until the clinical condition improves.</p>
<p class="indent">If hypoxemia develops, oxygen is administered. Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis is used to determine the need for oxygen and to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. Arterial blood gases may be used to obtain a baseline measure of the patient&#x2019;s oxygenation and acid&#x2013;base status; however, pulse oximetry is used to continuously monitor the patient&#x2019;s oxygen saturation and response to therapy. More aggressive respiratory support measures include administration of high concentrations of oxygen (<strong>fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>]</strong>, or the concentration of oxygen that is delivered), ET intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Different modes of mechanical ventilation may be required. Modes of mechanical ventilation are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s636"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pneumonia in older adult patients may occur as a primary diagnosis or as a complication of a chronic disease. Pulmonary infections in older adults frequently are difficult to treat and result in a higher mortality rate than in younger people (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Ramirez, 2019</a>). General deterioration, weakness, abdominal symptoms, anorexia, confusion, tachycardia, and tachypnea may signal the onset of pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia may be missed because the classic symptoms of cough, chest pain, sputum production, and fever may be absent or masked in older adult patients. In addition, the presence of some signs may be misleading. Abnormal breath sounds, for example, may be caused by microatelectasis that occurs as a result of decreased mobility, decreased lung volumes, or other respiratory function changes. Chest x-rays may be needed to differentiate chronic heart failure, which is often seen in older adults, from pneumonia as the cause of clinical signs and symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Supportive treatment includes hydration (with caution and with frequent assessment because of the risk of fluid overload in older adults); supplemental oxygen therapy; and assistance with deep breathing, coughing, frequent position changes, and early ambulation. All of these are particularly important in the care of older adult patients with pneumonia. To reduce or prevent serious complications of pneumonia in older adults, vaccination against pneumococcal and influenza infections is recommended.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s637"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SARS-CoV-2 is a community-acquired coronavirus whose primary pathologic evolution occurs within the respiratory system. Viral transmission is presumed to occur through direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets, although it is hypothesized that fomite transmission (i.e., transmission from inanimate surfaces that carry the virus) might be possible (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1441">Cascella, Rajnik, Cuomo, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>). SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through ACE2 cellular surface receptors where it replicates; these ACE2 receptors are particularly abundant in type II alveolar and vascular endothelial cells within the pulmonary vascular circuit (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>, <a href="c27-sec01.xhtml#ff27-2">Fig.&#x00A0;27-2</a> for an illustration of viral transmission and replication; see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for a discussion of risks of SAR-CoV-2).</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of this writing, although it is believed that some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may remain asymptomatic, others exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with a type of viral upper respiratory tract infection that may lead to viral pneumonia. Clinical manifestations consistent with mild COVID-19 may include fever, nonproductive cough, sore throat, fatigue, myalgias (muscle aches), nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia (loss of smell), and ageusia (loss of taste) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Cascella et al., 2020</a>; CDC, 2020). Data derived from epidemiologic studies in China, where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, suggest that approximately 81% of patients with COVID-19 have mild illness, with either mild viral pneumonia or no pneumonia (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wu &#x0026; McGoogan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by patient self-administered bilateral nasal swabbing for viral antigen or nucleic acid. Self-swabbing minimizes risk of person-to-person transmission of respiratory droplets. The act of patient self-swabbing ideally should be observed by a health care provider to assure it is performed properly (CDC, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients with known or suspected mild COVID-19 may be managed on an outpatient basis within their homes, which conserves hospital resources and diminishes likelihood of exposure to others, including health care workers (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>). At the present time, no specific medications are prescribed to either treat COVID-19 or mitigate its effects in patients with mild disease who are managed at home. The therapeutic regimens that patients with mild COVID-19 are advised to follow mirror those for other viral respiratory illnesses. Patients are advised to rest, hydrate, take antipyretic agents (e.g., acetaminophen) and monitor their symptoms. However, given the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, these patients must be capable of maintaining self-quarantine/isolation at home until all of the following criteria are met (CDC, 2020):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>At least 72 hours have transpired since the patient had a fever and the patient has not taken any antipyretic agents during that timeframe;</span></li>
<li><span>The patient reports an improvement in any respiratory manifestations of COVID-19; and</span></li>
<li><span>At least 10 days have elapsed since the patient first noted clinical manifestations suggestive of COVID-19.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Clinicians and others in contact with patients with suspected or known COVID-19 should observe infection control and prevention measures and utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE; CDC, 2020) (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with moderate COVID-19 should be hospitalized so that they may be closely observed on an ongoing basis, because many of these patients may rapidly deteriorate to severe COVID-19 and respiratory failure. These patients have clear evidence of viral pneumonia that may be diagnosed based upon clinical examination, chest x-ray or CT scan findings but have SpO<sub>2</sub> levels &#x003E;93% on room air, suggesting adequate oxygenation (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Cascella et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1522">National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel [NIH], 2020</a>). These patients may or may not have dyspnea. Laboratory tests upon admission include a CBC with differential, a complete metabolic panel, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer. Notable findings may include leukopenia (low white blood cell count), lymphopenia (low lymphocyte <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page541" title="541"></span>count), and elevated CK, LDH, CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer levels (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Cascella et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It appears at the present time that few patients with COVID-19 have a superinfection with bacterial pathogens (i.e., concomitant bacterial pneumonia); therefore, antibiotic agents are not routinely prescribed for the patient hospitalized to manage moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. However, if it is believed that the patient has a bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, then antibiotic agents indicated to treat CAP are prescribed (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">NIH, 2020</a>) (see previous discussion). Most patients are prescribed anticoagulant agents as prophylaxis, as they have a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion of VTE). The typical agents prescribed are low-molecular-weight heparins (e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin), administered twice daily (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support prescribing any antiviral or immunomodulating agents to manage patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">NIH, 2020</a>). If a patient must be prescribed an inhaled medication (e.g., to manage a preexisting chronic respiratory disease), then to the extent possible, that medication should be administered by a pMDI rather than an SVN, to minimize the likelihood of aerosolizing the patient&#x2019;s respiratory droplets into the ambient air. Ideally, patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia should be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms, with limitations enforced so that clinicians enter only as necessary, wearing appropriate PPE (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">NIH, 2020</a>) (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for further discussion). For instance, the nurse caring for the patient might arrange activities so that assessments are performed and medications are administered at the same time (see <a href="#ct19-7">Chart&#x00A0;19-7</a>).</p>
<p class="nonindent"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> The patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia has SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x2264;93% on room air with tachypnea and requires supplemental oxygen, perhaps with ET intubation and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page542" title="542"></span>mechanical ventilation (see later discussions on ET intubation and mechanical ventilation). Chest x-ray findings typically show diffuse, bilateral, &#x201C;ground-glass&#x201D; opacities (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Cascella et al., 2020</a>). Some patients have severe dyspnea, while others report no dyspnea and have been referred to as the <em>happy hypoxemics</em> by Caputo, Strayer, and Levitan (2020). Reportedly, many patients deteriorate rapidly and without clear prodromal clinical indicators from moderate to severe disease (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Cascella et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct19-7"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;19-7 <img class="m" src="images/icon55.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Is It Ever Ethical to Refuse to Care for a Patient?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You are a staff nurse in a medical intensive care unit (MICU). Within the past week, there has been a significantly increased incidence of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in two counties that border the county where your hospital is located. Your nurse manager holds an emergency mandatory staff meeting, and informs all staff present that preparations are being made for the hospital to receive and treat a large volume of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The MICU where you work has been designated to exclusively treat these patients who are critically ill, while the surgical ICU (SICU) in the hospital will admit all patients who are critically ill but do not have COVID-19. The MICU nurse manager describes hospital administration&#x2019;s plans to manage the distribution and rationing of personal protective equipment (PPE) for MICU staff and identifies new policies that have been emergently put in place to guide their usage, conservation, and disposal. H.S., a MICU staff nurse who works with you, turns to you and says &#x201C;I am not going to take care of patients with COVID-19! They can find another safer place for me to work in this hospital or I will quit. I did not sign up to be a nurse here to risk my life.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses who work in MICUs confront risks to their health on a continuing basis by being in contact with patients who have infectious diseases. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these health risks to nurses were minimal. Most pathogens that caused infectious diseases in patients in MICUs could be effectively treated pharmacologically (e.g., with antibiotics) in people with healthy immune systems. Many patients in MICUs who were critically ill with these infectious diseases had comorbid disorders that hampered their immune responses; however, a healthy nurse who became exposed to the pathogen would likely not become infected. Yet if the nurse did become ill, the nurse could have expected an expedient recovery to health after treatment was instituted. The personal risk to the nurse changes dramatically during pandemics, when the nurse is confronted with a novel aggressive contagious pathogen that can cause life-threatening illness in the previously healthy person, without the benefit of clearly effective evidence-based treatment strategies.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>). Should the principle of beneficence have preeminence during pandemics? Can the desire to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people ever be given greater moral credence than ensuring that individual rights are preserved?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assume that H.S. is a healthy 24-year-old woman without any known risk factors for COVID-19. Now assume she is 62 years old, with diabetes and hypertension, and that her 88-year-old mother resides with her. Do these factors make a difference in whether or not you would support her desire to not care for patients with COVID-19?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do you and H.S. have a professional obligation to care for patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill? Do you have the right to refuse to care for these patients? How might your viewpoint change, depending upon the availability or lack of availability of appropriate PPE? How would you evaluate the new policies put in place that guide the usage, conservation, and disposal of PPE in the MICU? What resources are available for you to evaluate the soundness of this policy, to ensure that you, H.S., and your MICU colleagues are not placed at undue risk? Identify professional resources that might help you to resolve this dilemma.</p>

<p class="indent">Although patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were nearly universally managed with ET intubation and mechanical ventilation during the first weeks of the pandemic, case fatality rates were reportedly much higher than anticipated (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Caputo et al., 2020</a>). That observation, along with actual or anticipated shortages of mechanical ventilators, led some providers to try managing patients with other strategies, including trials of placing nonintubated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the prone position at periodic intervals, along with administering high flow oxygen therapy. Although not universally effective, data from preliminary research suggest that periodic prone positioning with high flow oxygen therapy can prevent eventual ET intubation in some patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Caputo et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">At the present time, there are no immunomodulating agents that are recommended to treat severe COVID-19 pneumonia, although interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists (e.g., tocizilumab) are currently under investigation. IL-6 is believed to be a key cytokine responsible for propagating the haywire inflammatory response called cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or the &#x201C;cytokine storm&#x201D; that occurs in some patients with severe COVID-19 (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">NIH, 2020</a>) (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of CRS). Another therapy that is under investigation and approved for emergency use is using convalescent plasma, which transfuses antibodies from patients recovered from COVID-19 into patients with severe disease (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Kim &#x0026; Gandhi, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is recommended that the antiviral agent remdesivir be prescribed to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as it has demonstrated promising results in clinical trials, notably improved recovery times and overall outcomes (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1464">Beigel, Tomashek, Dodd, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">NIH, 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1549">Wang, Zhang, Du, et al., 2020</a>). Among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, a frequent and serious complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is commonly managed with ET intubation and mechanical ventilation (see later discussion). Among patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, the mortality rate is reported at 50% (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Anesi, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s638">Complications</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Shock and Respiratory Failure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Severe complications of pneumonia include hypotension and septic shock and respiratory failure (especially with gram-negative bacterial disease or with SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adult patients). These complications are encountered chiefly in patients who have received no specific treatment or inadequate or delayed treatment or in patients at risk for severe COVID-19. These complications are also encountered when the infecting organism is resistant to therapy, when a comorbid disease complicates the pneumonia, or when the patient is immune compromised. (See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for further discussion of management of the patient with septic shock.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pleural Effusion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A pleural effusion is an accumulation of pleural fluid in the pleural space (space between the parietal and visceral pleurae of the lung). A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion associated with bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis. After the pleural effusion is detected on a chest x-ray, a thoracentesis may be performed to remove the fluid, which is sent to the laboratory for analysis. There are three stages of parapneumonic pleural effusions based on pathogenesis: uncomplicated, complicated, and thoracic empyema. An <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;empyema:&lt;/b&gt; accumulation of purulent material in the pleural space">empyema</button></strong> occurs when thick, purulent fluid accumulates within the pleural space, often with fibrin development and a loculated (walled-off) area where the infection is located (see later discussion). A chest tube may be inserted to treat pleural infection by establishing proper drainage of the empyema. Sterilization of the empyema cavity requires 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics, and sometimes surgical management is required.</p>

<p class="processppara">Nursing assessment is critical in detecting pneumonia. Fever, chills, or night sweats in a patient who also has respiratory symptoms should alert the nurse to the possibility of bacterial pneumonia. Respiratory assessment further identifies the clinical manifestations of pneumonia: pleuritic-type pain, fatigue, tachypnea, the use of accessory muscles for breathing, bradycardia or relative bradycardia, coughing, and purulent sputum. The nurse monitors the patient for the following: changes in temperature and pulse; amount, odor, and color of secretions; frequency and severity of cough; degree of tachypnea or shortness of breath; changes in physical assessment findings (primarily assessed by inspecting and auscultating the chest); and changes in the chest x-ray findings.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition, it is important to assess older adult patients for unusual behavior, altered mental status, dehydration, excessive fatigue, and concomitant heart failure.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals may include improved airway patency, increased activity, maintenance of proper fluid volume, maintenance of adequate nutrition, an understanding of the treatment protocol and preventive measures, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> A<small>IRWAY</small> P<small>ATENCY</small></strong></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfdecdece6ce" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Nasopharyngeal Suctioning</b></p>
<p class="processppara">Removing secretions is important because retained secretions interfere with gas exchange and may slow recovery. The nurse encourages hydration (2 to 3 L/day), because adequate hydration thins and loosens pulmonary secretions. Humidification may be used to loosen secretions and improve ventilation. A high-humidity facemask (using either compressed air or oxygen) delivers warm, humidified air to the tracheobronchial tree, helps liquefy secretions, and relieves tracheobronchial irritation. Coughing can be initiated either voluntarily or by reflex. Lung expansion maneuvers, such as deep breathing with an incentive spirometer, may induce a cough. To improve airway patency, the nurse encourages the patient to perform an effective, directed cough, which includes correct positioning, a deep inspiratory maneuver, glottic closure, contraction of the expiratory muscles against the closed glottis, sudden glottic opening, and an explosive expiration. In some cases, the nurse may assist the patient by placing both hands on the lower rib cage (either anterior or posterior) to focus the patient on a slow deep breath, and then manually assisting the patient by applying constant, external pressure during the expiratory phase.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">CPT is important in loosening and mobilizing secretions (see <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#ff20-6">Figs. 20-6</a> and <a href="c20-sec01.xhtml#ff20-7">20-7</a> and further discussion in <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>). Indications for CPT include sputum retention not responsive to spontaneous or directed cough, a history of pulmonary problems previously treated with chest physiotherapy, continued evidence of retained secretions (decreased or abnormal breath sounds, change in vital signs), abnormal chest x-ray findings consistent with atelectasis or infiltrates, and deterioration in oxygenation. The patient is placed in the proper position to drain the involved lung segments, then the chest is percussed and vibrated either manually or with a mechanical percussor. The nurse may consult the respiratory therapist for volume expansion protocols and secretion management protocols that help direct the respiratory care of the patient and match the patient&#x2019;s needs with appropriate treatment schedules.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After each position change, the nurse encourages the patient to breathe deeply and cough. If the patient is too weak to cough effectively, the nurse may need to remove the mucus by nasotracheal suctioning. It may take time for secretions to mobilize and move into the central airways for expectoration. Therefore, it is important for the nurse to monitor the patient for cough and sputum production after the completion of CPT.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse also administers and titrates oxygen therapy as prescribed or via protocols. The effectiveness of oxygen therapy is monitored by improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, patient comfort, and adequate oxygenation values as measured by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> R<small>EST AND</small> C<small>ONSERVING</small> E<small>NERGY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse encourages the patient who is debilitated to rest and avoid overexertion and possible exacerbation of symptoms. The patient should assume a comfortable position to promote rest and breathing (e.g., semi-Fowler position) and should change positions frequently to enhance secretion clearance and pulmonary ventilation and perfusion. Outpatients must be instructed to avoid overexertion and to engage in only moderate activity during the initial phases of treatment.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> F<small>LUID</small> I<small>NTAKE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The respiratory rate of patients with pneumonia increases because of the increased workload imposed by labored breathing and fever. An increased respiratory rate leads to an increase in insensible fluid loss during exhalation and can lead to dehydration. Therefore, unless contraindicated, increased fluid intake (at least 2 L/day) is encouraged. Hydration must be achieved more slowly and with careful monitoring in patients with preexisting conditions such as heart failure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Many patients with shortness of breath and fatigue have a decreased appetite and consume only fluids. Fluids with electrolytes (commercially available drinks, such as Gatorade) may help provide fluid, calories, and electrolytes. Other nutritionally enriched drinks such as oral nutritional supplements may be used to supplement calories. Small, frequent meals may be advisable. In addition, IV fluids and nutrients may be given if necessary.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">P<small>ROMOTING</small> P<small>ATIENTS&#x2019;</small> K<small>NOWLEDGE</small></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient and family are educated about the cause of pneumonia, management of symptoms, signs and symptoms that should be reported to the primary provider or nurse, and the need for follow-up. The patient also needs information about factors (both patient risk factors and external factors) that may have contributed to the development of pneumonia and strategies to promote recovery and prevent recurrence. If the patient is hospitalized, they are instructed about the purpose and importance of management strategies that have been implemented and about the importance of adhering to them during and after the hospital stay. Explanations should be given simply and in language that the patient can understand. If possible, written instructions and information should be provided, and alternative formats should be provided for patients with hearing or vision loss, if necessary. Because of the severity of symptoms, the patient may require that instructions and explanations be repeated several times.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Continuing Symptoms After Initiation of Therapy.</span> The patient is observed for response to antibiotic therapy; patients usually begin to respond to treatment within 24 to 48 hours after antibiotic therapy is initiated. If the patient started taking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page544" title="544"></span>antibiotics before evaluation by culture and sensitivity of the causative organisms, antibiotics may need to be changed once the results are available. The patient is monitored for changes in physical status (deterioration of condition or resolution of symptoms) and for persistent recurrent fever, which may be a result of medication allergy (signaled possibly by a rash); medication resistance or slow response (greater than 48 hours) of the susceptible organism to therapy; pleural effusion; or pneumonia caused by an unusual organism, such as <em>P. jiroveci</em> or <em>Aspergillus fumigatus.</em> Failure of the pneumonia to resolve or persistence of symptoms despite changes on the chest x-ray raises the suspicion of other underlying disorders, such as lung cancer. As described previously, lung cancers may invade or compress airways, causing an obstructive atelectasis that may lead to pneumonia.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to monitoring for continuing symptoms of pneumonia, the nurse also monitors for other complications, such as septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and atelectasis, which may develop during the first few days of antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Shock and Respiratory Failure.</span> The nurse assesses for signs and symptoms of septic shock and respiratory failure by evaluating the patient&#x2019;s vital signs, pulse oximetry values, and hemodynamic monitoring parameters. The nurse reports signs of deteriorating patient status and assists in administering IV fluids and medications prescribed to combat shock. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required if respiratory failure occurs. (Sepsis and septic shock are described in detail in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, and care of the patient receiving mechanical ventilation is described later in this chapter.)</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Pleural Effusion.</span> If pleural effusion develops and thoracentesis is performed to remove fluid, the nurse assists in the procedure and explains it to the patient. After thoracentesis, the nurse monitors the patient for pneumothorax or recurrence of pleural effusion. If a chest tube needs to be inserted, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status (see discussion on chest tubes later in this chapter).</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box544"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for assisting the patient undergoing a thoracentesis, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Delirium.</span> A patient with pneumonia is assessed for delirium and other more subtle changes in cognitive status; this is especially true in the older adult. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a commonly used screening tool (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="c08-sec03.xhtml#ct8-7">Chart&#x00A0;8-7</a>). Confusion, suggestive of delirium, and other changes in cognitive status resulting from pneumonia are poor prognostic signs (File, 2019b). Delirium may be related to hypoxemia, fever, dehydration, sleep deprivation, or developing sepsis. The patient&#x2019;s underlying comorbid conditions may also play a part in the development of confusion. Addressing and correcting underlying factors as well as ensuring patient safety are important nursing interventions.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Depending on the severity of the pneumonia, treatment may occur in the hospital or in the outpatient setting. Patient education is crucial regardless of the setting, and the proper administration of antibiotics is important. In some instances, the patient may be treated initially with IV antibiotics as an inpatient and then discharged to continue the IV antibiotics at home. A seamless system of care must be maintained for the patient from hospital to home; this includes communication between the nurses caring for the patient in both settings.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If oral antibiotics are prescribed, the nurse educates the patient about their proper administration and potential side effects. The patient should be educated about symptoms that require contacting the primary provider: difficulty breathing, worsening cough, recurrent/increasing fever, and medication intolerance.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After the fever subsides, the patient may gradually increase activities. Fatigue and weakness may be prolonged after pneumonia, especially in older adults. The nurse encourages breathing exercises to promote secretion clearance and volume expansion. A patient who is being treated as an outpatient should be contacted by the health care team or instructed to contact the primary provider 24 to 48 hours after starting therapy. The patient is also instructed to return to the clinic or primary provider&#x2019;s office for a follow-up chest x-ray and physical examination. Often, improvement in chest x-ray findings lags behind improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse encourages the patient who smokes to stop smoking. Smoking inhibits tracheobronchial ciliary action, which is the first line of defense of the lower respiratory tract. Smoking also irritates the mucous cells of the bronchi and inhibits the function of alveolar macrophage (scavenger) cells. The patient is instructed to avoid stress, fatigue, sudden changes in temperature, and excessive alcohol intake, all of which lower resistance to pneumonia. The nurse reviews with the patient the principles of adequate nutrition and rest, because one episode of pneumonia may make a patient susceptible to recurring respiratory tract infections.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="spanheadh4">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Patients who are severely debilitated or who cannot care for themselves may require referral for home, transitional, or community-based care. During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical status, monitors for complications, assesses the home environment, and reinforces previous education. The patient&#x2019;s adherence to the therapeutic regimen is evaluated (i.e., taking medications as prescribed; performing breathing exercises; consuming adequate fluid and dietary intake; and avoiding smoking, alcohol, and excessive activity). The nurse stresses to the patient and family the importance of monitoring for complications or exacerbation of the pneumonia. The patient is encouraged to obtain an influenza vaccination at the prescribed times, because influenza increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia, especially that caused by staphylococci, <em>H. influenzae,</em> and <em>S. pneumoniae.</em> The patient also is urged to receive the pneumococcal vaccine(s) according to CDC recommendations (see previous discussion).</p>
