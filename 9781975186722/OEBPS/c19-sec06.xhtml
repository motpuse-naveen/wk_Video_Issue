<h4 class="h4" id="s642">Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lung parenchyma. It also may be transmitted to other parts of the body, including the meninges, kidneys, bones, and lymph nodes. The primary infectious agent, <em>M. tuberculosis,</em> is an acid-fast aerobic rod that grows slowly and is sensitive to heat and ultraviolet light. <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> and <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> have rarely been associated with the development of a TB infection.</p>
<p class="indent">TB is a worldwide public health problem that is closely associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, substandard housing, and inadequate health care. Mortality and morbidity rates continue to rise; <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infects an estimated one third of the world&#x2019;s population and remains the leading cause of death from infectious disease in the world. In 2017, 10 million people were sick with TB throughout the world, and there were 1.3 million TB-related deaths (CDC, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">In the United States, 9105 cases of TB were reported in 2017, which is a 2.3% decrease from 2016 (CDC, 2018b). Factors that prevent elimination of TB in the United States include the prevalence of TB among foreign-born residents, delays in detecting and reporting cases of TB, the lack of protection of contacts of people with infectious cases of TB, the presence of a substantial number of people with latent TB, and barriers to supporting clinical and public health expertise in this disease (CDC, 2018b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s643">Transmission and Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">TB spreads from person to person by airborne transmission. An infected person releases droplet nuclei (usually particles 1 to 5 mcm in diameter) through talking, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or singing. Larger droplets settle; smaller droplets remain suspended in the air and are inhaled by a susceptible person. <a href="#ct19-10">Chart&#x00A0;19-10</a> lists risk factors for TB. <a href="#ct19-11">Chart&#x00A0;19-11</a> summarizes the CDC&#x2019;s recommendations for the prevention of TB transmission in health care settings.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s644">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">TB begins when a susceptible person inhales mycobacteria and becomes infected. The bacteria are transmitted through the airways to the alveoli, where they are deposited and begin to multiply. The bacilli also are transported via the lymph system and bloodstream to other parts of the body (kidneys, bones, cerebral cortex) and other areas of the lungs (upper lobes). The body&#x2019;s immune system responds by initiating an inflammatory reaction. Phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) engulf many of the bacteria, and TB-specific lymphocytes lyse (destroy) the bacilli and normal tissue. This tissue reaction results in the accumulation of exudate in the alveoli, causing bronchopneumonia. The initial infection usually occurs 2 to 10 weeks after exposure.</p>
<p class="indent">Granulomas, new tissue masses of live and dead bacilli, are surrounded by macrophages, which form a protective wall. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page547" title="547"></span>They are then transformed to a fibrous tissue mass, the central portion of which is called a <em>Ghon tubercle.</em> The material (bacteria and macrophages) becomes necrotic, forming a cheesy mass. This mass may become calcified and form a collagenous scar. At this point, the bacteria become dormant, and there is no further progression of active disease.</p>

<p class="indent">After initial exposure and infection, active disease may develop because of a compromised or inadequate immune system response. Active disease also may occur with reinfection and activation of dormant bacteria. In this case, the <em>Ghon tubercle</em> ulcerates, releasing the cheesy material into the bronchi. The bacteria then become airborne, resulting in the further spread of the disease. Then, the ulcerated tubercle heals and forms scar tissue. This causes the infected lung to become more inflamed, resulting in the further development of bronchopneumonia and tubercle formation.</p>
<p class="indent">Unless this process is arrested, it spreads slowly downward to the hilum of the lungs and later extends to adjacent lobes. The process may be prolonged and is characterized by long remissions when the disease is arrested, followed by periods of renewed activity. Approximately 10% of people who are initially infected develop active disease (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Pozniak, 2019</a>). Some people develop reactivation TB (also called <em>adult-type progressive TB</em>). The reactivation of a dormant focus occurring during the primary infection is the cause.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s645">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB are insidious. Most patients have a low-grade fever, cough, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. The cough may be nonproductive, or mucopurulent sputum may be expectorated. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemoptysis:&lt;/b&gt; expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract">Hemoptysis</button></strong> (i.e., coughing up blood) also may occur. Both the systemic and the pulmonary symptoms are chronic and may have been present for weeks to months. Older adult patients usually present with less pronounced symptoms than younger patients. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page548" title="548"></span>Extrapulmonary disease occurs in up to 20% of cases in the United States (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Bernardo, 2019</a>). In patients infected with HIV, extrapulmonary disease is more prevalent.</p>

Interpretation of the Mantoux test is discussed in the text.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s646">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Once a patient presents with a positive skin test, blood test, or sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB; see later discussion on these), additional assessments must be done. These tests include a complete history, physical examination, tuberculin skin test, chest x-ray, and drug susceptibility testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical manifestations of fever, anorexia, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, cough, and sputum production prompt a more thorough assessment of respiratory function&#x2014;for example, assessing the lungs for consolidation by evaluating breath sounds (diminished, bronchial sounds; crackles), fremitus, and egophony. If the patient is infected with TB, the chest x-ray usually reveals lesions in the upper lobes. For all patients, the initial <em>M. tuberculosis</em> isolate should be tested for drug resistance. Drug susceptibility patterns should be repeated at 3 months for patients who do not respond to therapy (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Sterling, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Tuberculin Skin Test</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The Mantoux method is used to determine whether a person has been infected with the TB bacillus and is used widely in screening for latent <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection. The Mantoux method is a standardized, intracutaneous injection procedure and should be performed only by those trained in its administration and reading. Tubercle bacillus extract (tuberculin), purified protein derivative (PPD), is injected into the intradermal layer of the inner aspect of the forearm, approximately 4 inches below the elbow (see <a href="#ff19-3">Fig.&#x00A0;19-3</a>). Intermediate-strength PPD, in a tuberculin syringe with a half-inch 26- or 27-gauge needle, is used. The needle, with the bevel facing up, is inserted beneath the skin. Then, 0.1 mL of PPD is injected, creating an elevation in the skin, a well-demarcated wheal 6 to 10 mm in diameter. The site, antigen name, strength, lot number, date, and time of the test are recorded. The test result is read 48 to 72 hours after injection. Tests read after 72 hours tend to underestimate the true size of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;induration:&lt;/b&gt; an abnormally hard lesion or reaction, as in a positive tuberculin skin test">induration</button></strong> (raised hard area or swelling). A delayed localized reaction indicates that the person is sensitive to tuberculin.</p>
<p class="indent">A reaction occurs when both induration and erythema (redness) are present. After the area is inspected for induration, it is lightly palpated across the injection site, from the area of normal skin to the margins of the induration. The diameter of the induration (not erythema) is measured in millimeters at its widest part (see <a href="#ff19-3">Fig.&#x00A0;19-3</a>), and the size of the induration is documented. Erythema without induration is not considered significant.</p>
<p class="indent">The size of the induration determines the significance of the reaction. A reaction of 0 to 4 mm is considered not significant. A reaction of 5 mm or greater may be significant in people who are considered to be at risk. It is defined as positive in patients who are HIV positive or have HIV risk factors and are of unknown HIV status, in those who are close contacts of someone with active TB, and in those who have chest x-ray results consistent with TB. An induration of 10 mm or greater is usually considered significant in people who have normal or mildly impaired immunity. A significant reaction indicates past exposure to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> or vaccination with bacille Calmette-Gu&#x00E9;rin (BCG) vaccine. The BCG vaccine is given to produce a greater resistance to development of TB. The BCG vaccine is used in Europe and Latin America but not routinely in the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">A significant (positive) reaction does not necessarily mean that active disease is present in the body. More than 90% of people who are tuberculin-significant reactors do not develop clinical TB (CDC, 2018b). However, all significant reactors are candidates for active TB. In general, the more intense the reaction, the greater the likelihood of an active infection. Additional testing is needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or active TB.</p>
<p class="indent">A nonsignificant (negative) skin test means the person&#x2019;s immune system did not react to the test and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. It does not exclude TB infection or disease, because patients who are immunosuppressed cannot develop an immune response that is adequate to produce a positive skin test. This is referred to as anergy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">QuantiFERON-TB Gold<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Plus and T-SPOT<sup>&#x00AE;</sup></h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are two TB blood tests (called interferon&#x2013;gamma release assays or IGRAs) available in the United States: the QuantiFERON-TB Gold<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Plus (QFT-Plus) test and the T-SPOT<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>. TB blood tests are the preferred diagnostic tests for patients who have received the BCG vaccine and for patients who are not likely to return for a second appointment to look for a reaction to the tuberculin skin test. The results of both of these tests are available within 24 to 36&#x00A0;hours. A positive IGRA signifies that the patient has been infected with TB bacteria and additional tests are needed. A negative IGRA means that the patient&#x2019;s blood did not react to the test and a latent or active TB infection is not likely (CDC, 2019d; Theel, Hilgart, Breen-Lyles, et al., 2018).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 548</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page549" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="549">p. 549</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Sputum Culture</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A sputum specimen may be used to screen for TB. The presence of AFB on a sputum smear may indicate disease but does not confirm the diagnosis of TB because some AFB are not <em>M. tuberculosis.</em> A culture is done to confirm the diagnosis. For all patients, the initial <em>M. tuberculosis</em> isolate should be tested for drug resistance (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Sterling, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s647"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">TB may have atypical manifestations in older adult patients, whose symptoms may include unusual behavior and altered mental status, fever, anorexia, and weight loss. In many older adult patients, the tuberculin skin test produces no reaction (loss of immunologic memory) or delayed reactivity for up to 1 week (recall phenomenon). A second skin test is performed in 1 to 2 weeks. Older adults who live in long-term care facilities are at increased risk for primary and reactivated TB as compared to those in the community (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Rajagopalan, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s648">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary TB is treated primarily with anti-TB agents for 6 to 12 months. A prolonged treatment duration is necessary to ensure eradication of the organisms and to prevent relapse. The continuing and increasing resistance of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> to TB medications is a worldwide concern and challenge in TB therapy. Drug resistance must be considered when planning effective therapy, including the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Multidrug resistance (MDR TB):</em> Resistance to two agents, isoniazid and rifampin. The populations at greatest risk for multidrug resistance are those who are HIV positive, institutionalized, or homeless.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Extensively drug resistant (XDR TB)</em>: Resistance to isoniazid and rifampin, in addition to any fluroquinolone, and at least one of three injectable second-line agents (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). The populations at greatest risk are those with HIV infection or other immunocompromised conditions (CDC, 2019d).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The increasing prevalence of drug resistance points out the need to begin TB treatment with four or more medications, to ensure completion of therapy, and to develop and evaluate new anti-TB medications.</p>

<p class="indent">In current TB therapy, four first-line medications are used (see <a href="#tt19-4">Table&#x00A0;19-4</a>): isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Combination medications, such as isoniazid and rifampin or isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page550" title="550"></span>medications given twice a week (e.g., rifapentine) are available to help improve patient adherence. However, these medications are more costly.</p>
<p class="indent">Multidrug-resistant TB is difficult to treat. Treatment is guided by sputum specimen culture and sensitivity testing as the patient typically is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2019) recently published recommendations for treatment consisting of multiple medications to combat drug-resistant organisms. It is important to consult current recommendations for treatment (WHO, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Recommended treatment guidelines for newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary TB have two phases: an initial treatment phase and a continuation phase (CDC, 2019d). The initial phase consists of a multiple-medication regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol plus vitamin B<sub>6</sub> 50&#x00A0;mg. All are taken once a day and are oral medications. This initial intensive-treatment regimen is given daily for 8 weeks, after which options for the continuation phase of treatment include isoniazid and rifampin or isoniazid and rifapentine. The continuation regimen lasts for an additional 4 or 7 months. The 4-month period is used for the large majority of patients. The 7-month period is recommended for patients with cavitary pulmonary TB whose sputum culture after the initial 2 months of treatment is positive, for those whose initial phase of treatment did not include pyrazinamide, and for those being treated once weekly with isoniazid and rifapentine whose sputum culture is positive at the end of the initial phase of treatment. People are considered noninfectious after 2 to 3 weeks of continuous medication therapy. The total number of doses taken, not simply the duration of treatment, more accurately determines whether a course of therapy has been completed (CDC, 2019d).</p>
<p class="indent">Isoniazid also may be used as a prophylactic (preventive) measure for people who are at risk for significant disease, including:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Household family members of patients with active disease</span></li>
<li><span>Patients with HIV infection who have a PPD test reaction with 5 mm of induration or more</span></li>
<li><span>Patients with fibrotic lesions suggestive of old TB detected on a chest x-ray and a PPD reaction with 5 mm of induration or more</span></li>
<li><span>Patients whose current PPD test results show a change from former test results, suggesting recent exposure to TB and possible infection (skin test converters)</span></li>
<li><span>Patients who use IV/injection drugs who have PPD test results with 10 mm of induration or more</span></li>
<li><span>Patients with high-risk comorbid conditions and a PPD result with 10 mm of induration or more</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Other candidates for preventive isoniazid therapy are those 35 years or younger who have PPD test results with 10&#x00A0;mm of induration or more and one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Individuals who are foreign-born from countries with a high prevalence of TB</span></li>
<li><span>Populations that are high-risk and medically underserved</span></li>
<li><span>Patients living in institutions</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Prophylactic isoniazid treatment involves taking daily doses for 6 to 12 months. Liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels are monitored monthly. Sputum culture <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page551" title="551"></span>results are monitored for AFB to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the treatment regimen.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s649">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management includes promoting airway clearance, advocating adherence to the treatment regimen, promoting activity and nutrition, and preventing transmission.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Airway Clearance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Copious secretions obstruct the airways in many patients with TB and interfere with adequate gas exchange. Increasing the fluid intake promotes systemic hydration and serves as an effective expectorant. The nurse instructs the patient about correct positioning to facilitate airway drainage, referred to as postural drainage (see <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>). Postural drainage allows the force of gravity to assist in the removal of bronchial secretions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Adherence to Treatment Regimen</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen is key in treating the disease and controlling the spread of infection. The multiple-medication regimen that the patient must follow can be quite complex. Understanding of the medications, schedule, and side effects is important. The nurse educates the patient that TB is a communicable disease and that taking medications is the most effective means of preventing transmission. The major reason treatment fails is that patients do not take their medications regularly and for the prescribed duration. This may be due to side effects or the complexity of the treatment regimen. Risk factors for nonadherence to the drug regimen include patients who have previously failed to complete the course of therapy; patients who are physically, emotionally, or mentally challenged; patients unable to pay for medication; patients actively abusing illicit substances; and patients who do not understand the importance of treatment (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Reichman &#x0026; Lardizabal, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient to take the medication either on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before meals, because food interferes with medication absorption (although taking medications on an empty stomach frequently results in gastrointestinal upset). Patients taking isoniazid should avoid foods that contain tyramine and histamine (tuna, aged cheese, red wine, soy sauce, yeast extracts), because eating them while taking isoniazid may result in headache, flushing, hypotension, lightheadedness, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Patients should also avoid alcohol because of the high potential for hepatoxic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, rifampin can alter the metabolism of certain other medications, making them less effective. These medications include beta-blockers, oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, digoxin, quinidine, corticosteroids, oral hypoglycemic agents, oral contraceptives, theophylline, and verapamil. This issue should be discussed with the primary provider and pharmacist so that medication dosages can be adjusted accordingly. The nurse informs the patient that rifampin may discolor contact lenses and that the patient may want to wear eyeglasses during treatment. The nurse monitors for other side effects of anti-TB medications, including hepatitis, neurologic changes (hearing loss, neuritis), and rash. Liver enzymes, BUN, and serum creatinine levels are monitored to detect changes in liver and kidney function. Sputum culture results are monitored for AFB to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment regimen and adherence to therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient about the risk of drug resistance if the medication regimen is not strictly and continuously followed. The nurse carefully monitors vital signs and observes for spikes in temperature or changes in the patient&#x2019;s clinical status. Caregivers of patients who are not hospitalized are taught to monitor the patient&#x2019;s temperature and respiratory status. Changes in the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status are reported to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients at risk for nonadherence, programs used in the community setting may include comprehensive case management and directly observed therapy (DOT). In case management, each patient with TB is assigned a case manager who coordinates all aspects of the patient&#x2019;s care. DOT consists of a health care provider or other responsible person who directly observes that the patient ingests the prescribed medications. Although successful, DOT is a resource intensive program (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Herchline, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Activity and Adequate Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with TB are often debilitated from prolonged chronic illness and impaired nutritional status. The nurse plans a progressive activity schedule that focuses on increasing activity tolerance and muscle strength. Anorexia, weight loss, and malnutrition are common in patients with TB. The patient&#x2019;s willingness to eat may be altered by fatigue from excessive coughing; sputum production; chest pain; generalized debilitated state; or cost, if the patient has few resources. Identifying facilities (e.g., shelters, soup kitchens, Meals on Wheels) that provide meals in the patient&#x2019;s neighborhood may increase the likelihood that the patient with limited resources and energy will have access to a more nutritious intake. A nutritional plan that allows for small, frequent meals may be required. Liquid nutritional supplements may assist in meeting basic caloric requirements.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Transmission of Tuberculosis Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To prevent transmission of TB to others, the nurse carefully educates the patient about important hygiene measures, including mouth care, covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, proper disposal of tissues, and hand hygiene. TB is a disease that must be reported to the health department so that people who have been in contact with the affected patient during the infectious stage can undergo screening and possible treatment, if indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the risk of transmission of TB infection to other people, it can also be spread to other parts of the body of affected patients. Spread or dissemination of TB infection to nonpulmonary sites of the body is known as miliary TB. Miliary TB is seen in approximately 1.5% of all patients with TB (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Lessnau, 2019</a>). It is the result of invasion of the bloodstream by the tubercle bacillus. Usually, it results from late reactivation of a dormant infection in the lung or elsewhere. The origin of the bacilli that enter the bloodstream is either a chronic focus that has ulcerated into a blood vessel or multitudes of miliary tubercles lining the inner surface of the thoracic duct. The organisms migrate from these foci into the bloodstream, are carried throughout the body, and disseminate throughout all tissues, with tiny miliary tubercles developing in the lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, meninges, and other organs.</p>
<p class="indent">The clinical course of miliary TB may vary from an acute, rapidly progressive infection with high fever to a slowly developing process with low-grade fever, anemia, and debilitation. At first, there may be no localizing signs except an enlarged spleen and a reduced number of leukocytes. However, within a few weeks, the chest x-ray reveals small densities scattered diffusely throughout both lung fields; these are the miliary tubercles, which gradually grow.</p>
<p class="indent">The possibility of spread to nonpulmonary sites in the body requires careful monitoring for this very serious form of TB. The nurse monitors vital signs and observes for spikes in temperature as well as changes in renal and cognitive function. Few physical signs may be elicited on physical examination of the chest, but at this stage, the patient has a severe cough and dyspnea. Treatment of miliary TB is the same as for pulmonary TB.</p>
