<h4 class="h4" id="s3109">Degenerative Disc Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Low back pain is the second most common neurologic disorder in the United States, with one quarter of all adults reporting recent (within 3 months) back pain (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). It is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and stress; and it is the most common reason for missed work and decreased productivity while at work (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4524">Ramanathan, Hibbert, Wiles, et al., 2018</a>). Low back pain results in significant economic costs to patients, their families, and society. Acute pain lasts less than 3 months, whereas chronic pain has a duration of 3 months or longer. Approximately 90% of patients with low back pain recover spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). See <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>, <a href="c36-sec01.xhtml#ct36-2">Chart&#x00A0;36-2</a> for further discussion of strategies to prevent acute low back pain.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3110">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The intervertebral disc is a cartilaginous plate that forms a cushion between the vertebral bodies (see <a href="c65-sec06.xhtml#ff65-6">Fig.&#x00A0;65-6</a>A). This tough, fibrous material is incorporated in a capsule. A ball-like cushion in the center of the disc is called the <em>nucleus pulposus.</em> In herniation of the intervertebral disc (ruptured disc), the nucleus of the disc protrudes into the annulus (the fibrous ring around the disc), with subsequent nerve compression (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Norris, 2019</a>). Protrusion or rupture of the nucleus pulposus usually is preceded by degenerative changes that occur with aging. Loss of protein polysaccharides in the disc decreases the water content of the nucleus pulposus. The development of radiating cracks in the annulus weakens resistance to nucleus herniation. After trauma (falls and repeated minor stresses such as lifting incorrectly), the cartilage may be injured.</p>
<p class="indent">For most patients, the immediate symptoms of trauma are short-lived, and those resulting from injury to the disc do not appear for months or years. Disc degeneration pushes the capsule back into the spinal canal. It could also rupture and allow the nucleus pulposus to be pushed back against the dural sac or against a spinal nerve as it emerges from the spinal column (see <a href="c65-sec06.xhtml#ff65-6">Fig.&#x00A0;65-6</a>B). This disease of the spinal root produces pain and extreme sensitivity to touch due to radiculopathy (pressure in the area of distribution of the involved nerve endings). Continued pressure may produce degenerative changes in the involved nerve, such as changes in sensation and deep tendon reflexes.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3111"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Low back pain is commonly reported in older adults (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Degenerative disc disease is also prevalent among older adults, but age alone should not exclude a patient from undergoing lumbar fusion if indicated (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4491">Badhiwala, Karmur, Hachem, et al., 2019</a>). Researchers studied a group of 2238 patients (<em>n</em> = 1119, age &#x003C;70; <em>n</em> = 1119, age &#x2265;70) who underwent spinal fusion. The groups were balanced for factors including sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, smoking, chronic steroid use, type of fusion, and number of levels (see later discussion). Rates of all complications were similar between younger and older age groups, except urinary tract infection, which was more frequent among the &#x2265;70 age group (OR 2.32, <em>p</em> = .009). Those in the older age group were more likely to be discharged to a rehabilitation or skilled care facility, rather than directly home (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Badhiwala et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3112">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A herniated disc with accompanying pain may occur in any portion of the spine: cervical, thoracic (rare), or lumbar. The clinical manifestations depend on the location, the rate of development (acute or chronic), and the effect on the surrounding structures. Functional limitations are the main manifestation reported by patients. Researchers also report that pain intensity in patients with low back pain has a direct effect on ADLs and sleep quality (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4513">Kose, Tastan, Temiz, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3113">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A thorough health history and physical examination are important to rule out potentially serious conditions that may manifest as low back pain, including fracture, tumor, infection, or cauda equina syndrome (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The MRI scan has become the diagnostic tool of choice for localizing even small disc protrusions, particularly for lumbar spine disease. If the clinical symptoms are not consistent with the pathology seen on MRI, CT scanning and myelography are performed. A neurologic examination is carried out to determine whether reflex, sensory, or motor impairment from root compression is present and to provide a baseline for future assessment. Electromyography may be used to localize the specific spinal nerve roots involved. See <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>, <a href="c36-sec01.xhtml#ct36-1">Chart&#x00A0;36-1</a> for a summary of additional diagnostic studies that may be used to evaluate low back pain.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3114">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Herniations of the cervical and the lumbar discs occur most commonly and are usually managed conservatively with medication and physical therapy or exercise (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Surgery is sometimes necessary.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical excision of a herniated disc is performed if there is evidence of a progressing neurologic deficit (muscle weakness and atrophy, loss of sensory and motor function, loss of sphincter control) and radicular pain (pain that follows the dermatomal distribution [see <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>, <a href="c60-sec01.xhtml#ff60-9">Fig.&#x00A0;60-9</a>] of the compressed nerve) that are unresponsive to conservative management. The goal of surgical treatment is to reduce the pressure on the nerve root to relieve pain and reverse neurologic deficits. Microsurgical techniques make it possible to remove only the amount of tissue that is necessary, which preserves the integrity of normal tissue better and imposes less trauma on the body. During these procedures, spinal cord function can be monitored electrophysiologically.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the surgical techniques available include (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>):</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Microdiscectomy:</em> Removal of herniated or extruded fragments of intervertebral disc material</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Laminectomy:</em> Removal of the bone between the spinal process and facet pedicle junction to expose the neural elements in the spinal canal; this allows the surgeon to inspect the spinal canal, identify and remove pathologic tissue, and relieve compression of the cord and roots</span></li>
<li><span><em>Hemilaminectomy:</em> Removal of part of the lamina and part of the posterior arch of the vertebra</span></li>
<li><span><em>Partial laminectomy or laminotomy:</em> Creation of a hole in the lamina of a vertebra</span></li>
<li><span><em>Discectomy with fusion:</em> Fusion of the vertebral spinous process with a bone graft (from iliac crest or bone bank), with the object of spinal fusion being to bridge over the defective disc to stabilize the spine and reduce the rate of recurrence</span></li>
<li><span><em>Foraminotomy:</em> Enlargement of the intervertebral foramen to increase the space for exit of a spinal nerve, resulting in reduced pain, compression, and edema</span></li></ul>
