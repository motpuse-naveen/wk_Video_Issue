<h4 class="h4" id="s1947">Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)</strong> results from a failure of the negative feedback system that regulates the release and inhibition of ADH (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). Patients with SIADH cannot excrete a dilute urine, retain fluids, and develop a sodium deficiency known as dilutional hyponatremia. SIADH is often of nonendocrine origin; for instance, the syndrome may occur in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma in which malignant lung cells synthesize and release ADH. SIADH has also occurred in patients with severe pneumonia, pneumothorax, and other disorders of the lungs, as well as malignant tumors that affect other organs (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Disorders of the central nervous system, such as head injury, brain surgery or tumor, and infection, are thought to produce SIADH by direct stimulation of the pituitary gland (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). Some medications (e.g., vincristine, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, thiazide diuretics) and nicotine have been implicated in SIADH; they either directly stimulate the pituitary gland or increase the sensitivity of renal tubules to circulating ADH.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1948">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SIADH is generally self-limiting and treatment is focused on eliminating the underlying cause, if possible, and restricting fluid intake (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Parham &#x0026; Silverstein, 2019</a>). Because retained water is excreted slowly through the kidneys, the extracellular fluid volume contracts and the serum sodium concentration gradually increases toward normal. Diuretic agents such as furosemide may be used along with fluid restriction. In severe hyponatremia sometimes a hypertonic NaCl (3%) may be prescribed and administered IV (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1949">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Close monitoring of fluid I&#x0026;O, daily weight, urine and blood chemistries, and neurologic status is indicated for the patient at risk for SIADH. Supportive measures and explanations of procedures and treatments assist the patient in managing this disorder.</p>
