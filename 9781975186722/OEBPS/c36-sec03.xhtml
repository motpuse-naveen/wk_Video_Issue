<h4 class="h4" id="s1439">Common Foot Problems</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Disorders of the foot may be caused by poorly fitting shoes, which distort normal anatomy while inducing deformity and pain. Dermatologic problems commonly affect the feet in the form of fungal infections and plantar warts. Several systemic diseases affect the feet. Patients with diabetes are prone to develop corns and peripheral neuropathies with diminished sensation, leading to diabetic ulcers at pressure points of the foot. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and arteriosclerosis complain of burning and itching feet, resulting in scratching and skin breakdown. Foot deformities may occur with RA. Obesity can cause a host of foot anomalies, including adult-onset pes planus (i.e., &#x201C;fallen arches&#x201D;) and plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p class="indent">The discomforts of foot strain are treated with rest, elevation, physiotherapy, supportive taping, and orthotic devices (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2588">Luffy, Grosel, Thomas, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The patient must inspect the foot and skin under pads and orthotic devices for pressure and skin breakdown daily. If a &#x201C;window&#x201D; is cut into shoes to relieve pressure over a bony deformity, the skin must be monitored daily for breakdown from pressure exerted at the window area. Active foot exercises promote circulation and help strengthen the feet. Walking in properly fitting shoes is considered the ideal exercise.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1440">Callus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A callus is a thickened area of the skin that has been exposed to persistent pressure or friction. Faulty foot mechanics usually precede the formation of a callus. Treatment consists of eliminating the underlying causes and having a painful callus treated by a podiatrist. A keratolytic ointment may be applied and a thin plastic cup worn over the heel if the callus is on this area. Felt padding with an adhesive backing is also used to prevent and relieve pressure. Prevention of the callus is best, with attention to well-fitting socks and shoes. Orthotic devices can be made to remove the pressure from bony protuberances, or the protuberance may be excised (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2626">van Netten, Sacco, Lavery, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1441">Corn</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A corn is an area of hyperkeratosis (overgrowth of a horny layer of epidermis) produced by internal pressure (the underlying bone is prominent because of a congenital or acquired abnormality, commonly arthritis) or external pressure (ill-fitting shoes). The fifth toe is most frequently involved, but any toe may be involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Corns are treated by a podiatrist by soaking and scraping off the horny layer, by application of a protective shield or pad, or by surgical modification of the underlying offending osseous structure. Early intervention is required for patients with diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent">Soft corns are located between the toes and are kept soft by moisture. Treatment consists of drying the affected spaces and separating the affected toes with lamb&#x2019;s wool or gauze. A wider shoe and toe box may be helpful (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Malhotra, Davda, &#x0026; Singh, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1442">Hammer Toe</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hammer toe is a flexion deformity of the interphalangeal joint, which may involve several toes (see <a href="#ff36-6">Fig. 36-6</a><strong>A</strong>). Tight socks or shoes may push an overlying toe back into the line of the other toes. The toes usually are pulled upward, forcing the metatarsal joints (ball of the foot) downward. Corns develop on top of the toes, and tender calluses develop under the metatarsal area. Treatment consists of conservative measures: wearing open-toed sandals (unless the patient has diabetes) or shoes that conform to the shape of the foot with a round toe box, carrying out manipulative exercises, and protecting the protruding joints with pads. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteotomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical cutting of bone">Osteotomy</button></strong> (surgical cutting of the bone) may be used to correct a resulting deformity. There is little evidence to support treatment of hammer toe when the patient does not report pain or other symptoms (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2589">Malhotra et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Orthotics may help prevent hammer toe in people with high arches. Attention is required for patients with diabetes who may develop friction points, causing wounds.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1443">Onychocryptosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Onychocryptosis (ingrown toenail) is a condition in which the free edge of a nail plate penetrates the surrounding skin. A secondary infection or granulation tissue may develop. This painful condition is caused by improper self-treatment, external pressure (tight shoes or stockings), internal pressure (deformed toes, growth under the nail), trauma, or infection. Trimming the nails properly (clipping them straight across and filing the corners consistent with the contour of the toe) can prevent this problem. Active treatment consists of washing the foot twice a day and relieving the pain by decreasing the pressure of the nail plate on the surrounding soft tissue. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1121" title="1121"></span>Warm, wet soaks help drain an infection. A toenail may need to be excised by the podiatrist or primary provider if there are recurrent infections (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2589">Malhotra et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1444">Pes Cavus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pes cavus (clawfoot) refers to a foot with an abnormally high arch and a fixed equines deformity of the forefoot (see <a href="#ff36-6">Fig. 36-6</a><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B</button></strong>). The shortening of the foot and increased pressure produce calluses on the metatarsal area and on the dorsum of the foot. Charcot&#x2013;Marie&#x2013;Tooth disease (a peripheral neuromuscular disease associated with a familial degenerative disorder), diabetes, and progressive neurologic disorders are common causes (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Alderson &#x0026; Ghosh, 2019</a>). Exercises are prescribed to manipulate the forefoot into dorsiflexion and relax the toes. Orthotic devices alleviate pain and can protect the foot. In severe cases, arthrodesis (fusion) is performed to reshape and stabilize the foot.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1445">Hallux Valgus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hallux valgus (bunion) is a deformity in which the great toe deviates laterally (see <a href="#ff36-6">Fig. 36-6</a><strong>C</strong>). There is a marked prominence of the medial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. There is also osseous enlargement (exostosis) of the medial side of the first metatarsal head, over which a bursa may form (secondary to pressure and inflammation). Acute bursitis symptoms include a reddened area, edema, and tenderness.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors contributing to bunion formation include heredity, ill-fitting shoes, osteoarthritis, and the gradual lengthening and widening of the foot associated with aging. Treatment depends on the patient&#x2019;s age, the degree of deformity, and the severity of symptoms. In uncomplicated cases, wearing a shoe that conforms to the shape of the foot, or that is molded to the foot to prevent pressure on the protruding portions, may be the only treatment needed. Corticosteroid injections control acute inflammation. In advanced cases, surgical removal of the exostosis and toe realignment may be required to improve function, appearance, and symptoms. If surgery is required in an athlete, at least 3 months of rest is required before returning to play (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Fournier, Saxena, &#x0026; Maffuli, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1446">Morton Neuroma</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Morton neuroma (plantar digital neuroma, neurofibroma) is a swelling near the third (lateral) branch of the median plantar nerve (see <a href="#ff36-6">Fig. 36-6</a><strong>D</strong>). Microscopically, digital artery changes cause an ischemia within the third intermetatarsal (web) space. The result is a throbbing, burning pain in the foot that is usually relieved with rest and massage.</p>
<p class="indent">Conservative treatment consists of inserting innersoles and metatarsal pads designed to spread the metatarsal heads and balance the foot posture. Local injections of a corticosteroid and a local anesthetic may provide relief. If these fail, surgical excision of the neuroma is necessary. Pain relief and loss of sensation are immediate and permanent with surgery. The risk of falls is increased because of the loss of all sensation (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2592">Matthews, Hum, Harding, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1447">Pes Planus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pes planus (flatfoot) is a common disorder in which the longitudinal arch of the foot is diminished. It may be caused by congenital abnormalities or associated with bone or ligament injury, excessive weight, muscle fatigue, poorly fitting shoes, or arthritis. Signs and symptoms include a burning sensation, fatigue, clumsy gait, edema, and pain. Exercises to strengthen the muscles and to improve posture and walking habits are helpful (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Unver, Erdem, &#x0026; Akbas, 2019</a>). Foot orthoses can give the foot additional support.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1448">Plantar Fasciitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the foot-supporting fascia, presents as an acute onset of heel pain experienced with the first steps in the morning. The pain is localized to the anterior medial aspect of the heel and diminishes with gentle stretching of the foot and Achilles tendon. Management includes stretching exercises, wearing shoes with support and cushioning to relieve pain, orthotic devices (e.g., heel cups, arch supports, night splints), and corticosteroid injections. Unresolved plantar fasciitis may progress to fascial tears at the heel and eventual development of heel spurs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2588">Luffy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1449">Nursing Management of the Patient Undergoing Foot Surgery</h5>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1121</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1122" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1122">p. 1122</span></div>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery of the foot may be necessary because of various conditions, including neuromas and foot deformities (bunion, hammer toe, clawfoot). Generally, foot surgery is performed on an outpatient basis. Before surgery, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s gait and balance, as well as the neurovascular status of the foot. Additionally, the nurse considers the availability of assistance at home and the structural characteristics of the home in planning for care during the days after surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative and home care follows the same principles as discussed earlier for hand surgery (see <a href="#ct36-4">Chart 36-4</a>). After surgery, neurovascular assessment of the exposed toes (every 1 to 2 hours for the first 24 hours) is essential to monitor the function of the nerves and the perfusion of the tissues. The nurse educates the patient and family about how to assess for edema and neurovascular status at home (circulation, motion, sensation). The affected foot is compared to the unaffected foot to determine differences in neurovascular function. Compromised neurovascular function can increase the patient&#x2019;s pain (see <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a>, <a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#ct35-4">Chart 35-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Pain experienced by patients who undergo foot surgery is related to inflammation and edema. Formation of a hematoma may contribute to the discomfort. To control the anticipated edema, the foot should be elevated on several pillows when the patient is sitting or lying. Support of the entire limb under the knee is preferable. Ice packs applied intermittently to the surgical area during the first 24 to 48 hours may be prescribed to control edema and provide some pain relief. As activity increases, the patient may find that dependent positioning of the foot is uncomfortable. Simply elevating the foot often relieves the discomfort. Oral analgesic agents may be used to control the pain. The nurse instructs the patient and family about appropriate use of these medications.</p>
<p class="indent">After surgery, the patient will have a bulky dressing on the foot, protected by a light cast or a special protective boot. Limits for weight bearing on the foot will be prescribed by the surgeon (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2589">Malhotra et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Some patients are allowed to walk on the heel and progress to weight bearing as tolerated; other patients are restricted to non&#x2013;weight-bearing activities. Assistive devices (e.g., crutches, walker) may be needed. The choice of the devices depends on the patient&#x2019;s general condition and balance and on the weight-bearing prescription. Safe use of the assistive devices must be ensured through adequate patient education and practice before discharge (see <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>). Strategies to move around the house safely while using assistive devices are also discussed with the patient. As healing progresses, the patient gradually resumes ambulation within prescribed limits. The nurse emphasizes adherence to the therapeutic regimen.</p>
<p class="indent">The immobility of lower extremity surgery increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) development. See <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for VTE risk assessment and treatment. Other postoperative complications may include limited range of motion, paresthesia, tendon injury, and recurrence of deformity. In addition, if percutaneous pins were used to hold bones in position, these pins may serve as potential sites of infection. Patient education concerning aseptic wound care and pin care may be necessary. See <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> for further discussion on pin care and infection prophylaxis. Care must be taken to protect the surgical wound from dirt and moisture. When bathing, the patient can secure a plastic bag over the dressing to prevent it from getting wet.</p>
