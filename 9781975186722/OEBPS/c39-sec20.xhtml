<h4 class="h4" id="s1651">Cancer of the Esophagus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In the United States, there are about 18,440 newly diagnosed cases of carcinoma of the esophagus annually; of these, 14,350 are men and 4,090 are women. Adenocarcinoma is more common among Whites, and squamous cell carcinoma is more frequently seen in African Americans. In the 1960s and 1970s, only about 5% of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer survived at least 5 years. Today, survival rates are approximately 20% at the 5-year mark (ACS, 2021a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1652">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Esophageal cancer can be of two cell types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The rate of adenocarcinoma is rapidly increasing in the United States as well as in other Western countries. It is found primarily in the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (ACS, 2021a).</p>
<p class="indent">Risk factors for esophageal cancer include chronic esophageal irritation or GERD. In the United States, cancer of the esophagus has been associated with ingestion of alcohol and the use of tobacco. There is an apparent association between GERD and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with BE (see previous discussion of risks) have a higher incidence of esophageal cancer (<a href="#bib2963">Iyer &#x0026; Kaul, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib2939">Sharma et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus include chronic ingestion of hot liquids or foods, nutritional deficiencies, poor oral hygiene, exposure to nitrosamines in the environment or food, cigarette smoking or chronic alcohol exposure (especially in Western cultures), and some esophageal medical conditions such as caustic injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Early stages of esophageal cancer are limited to the mucosa or submucosa; these stages of cancer have a 5-year survival rate of about 90% (<a href="#bib2963">Levine &#x0026; Rubesin, 2012</a>). In later stages, tumor cells of adenocarcinoma and of squamous cell carcinoma may spread beneath the esophageal mucosa or directly into, through, and beyond the muscle layers into the lymphatics. Obstruction of the esophagus is noted, with possible perforation into the mediastinum and erosion into the great vessels (<a href="#bib2963">Levine &#x0026; Rubesin, 2012</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1653">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients have an advanced ulcerated lesion of the esophagus before symptoms manifest. Symptoms include dysphagia, initially with solid foods and eventually with liquids; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1261" title="1261"></span>a sensation of a mass in the throat; painful swallowing; substernal pain or fullness; and, later, regurgitation of undigested food with halitosis and hiccups. The patient first becomes aware of intermittent and increasing difficulty in swallowing. As the tumor grows and the obstruction becomes nearly complete, even liquids cannot pass into the stomach. Regurgitation of food and saliva occurs, hemorrhage may take place, and progressive loss of weight and strength occurs from inadequate nutrition. Later symptoms include substernal pain, persistent hiccup, respiratory difficulty, and halitosis.</p>
<p class="indent">The delay between the onset of early symptoms and the patient seeking medical advice is often 12 to 18 months. Any person having swallowing difficulties should be encouraged to consult the primary provider immediately.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1654">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several imaging techniques may provide useful diagnostic information. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen is beneficial for detecting any anatomic evidence of metastatic disease, especially of the lungs, liver, and kidney. A PET scan may also help detect metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasound is used to determine whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and other mediastinal structures; it can also determine the size and invasiveness of the tumor. Exploratory laparoscopy is the best method for finding positive lymph nodes in patients with distal lesions (<a href="#bib2963">Cools-Lartigue, Molena, &#x0026; Gerdes, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Future diagnostic techniques that may serve as predictors for dysplastic progression in patients with BE involve molecular markers. Some data have shown that a small percentage of people may have a genetic predisposition to esophageal cancer. Researchers have identified several biomarkers with strong potential to predict outcomes in esophageal cancer, but none of these biomarkers are currently recommended or clinically available (<a href="#bib2963">Iyer &#x0026; Kaul, 2019</a>). The usefulness of molecular markers in treating esophageal cancer continues to be researched.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1655">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If esophageal cancer is detected at an early stage, treatment goals may be directed toward cure; however, it is often detected in late stages, making relief of symptoms the only reasonable goal of therapy. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of these modalities, depending on the type of cancer cell, the extent of the disease, and the patient&#x2019;s condition. A standard treatment plan for a patient who is newly diagnosed with esophageal cancer will vary depending on the staging but may include: endoscopic resection, chemoradiation followed by surgery, chemotherapy followed by surgery, surgery alone, definitive chemoradiation, or palliative measures (NCI, 2021a).</p>
<p class="indent">Although minimally invasive surgery may be possible in some cases, standard surgical management includes esophagectomy with removal of the tumor plus a wide tumor-free margin of the esophagus and the lymph nodes in the area. Variations on the original esophagectomy preserve nerves, employ less invasive techniques, and target specific areas of the esophagus (<a href="#bib2963">Schlottmann, Molena, &#x0026; Patti, 2018</a>). The surgical approach may be through the neck, thorax and/or the abdomen, depending on the location of the tumor. When tumors occur in the cervical or upper thoracic area, and the stomach cannot be mobilized, pulled up, and anastomosed to the esophagus, esophageal continuity may be maintained by performing a colon graft transfer, in which the tumor is removed and the area is replaced with a portion of the colon (see <a href="#ff39-12">Fig. 39-12</a>). In many of these cases, a feeding tube is placed in the jejunum during surgery for feeding (<a href="#bib2867">Schlottman et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

A portion of the colon is grafted between the esophagus and pharynx to replace the abnormal portion of the esophagus. The vascular structures are also anastomosed.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Tumors of the lower thoracic esophagus are more amenable to surgery than are tumors located higher in the esophagus. GI tract integrity is maintained by anastomosing the lower esophagus to the stomach (see <a href="#ff39-13">Fig. 39-13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Surgical resection of the esophagus has a relatively high mortality rate because of infection, pulmonary complications, or leakage through the anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient has an NG tube in place that should not be manipulated. The patient remains NPO until x-ray studies that confirm that the anastomosis is free from an esophageal leak, there is no obstruction, and that there is no evidence of pulmonary aspiration.</p>
<p class="indent">Palliative treatment may be necessary to keep the esophagus open, to assist with nutrition, and to control saliva. Palliation may be accomplished with dilation of the esophagus, laser therapy, placement of an endoprosthesis (stent) via EGD, radiation, or chemotherapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1656"><img class="m" src="images/icon17-fat.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative nursing management is directed toward improving the patient&#x2019;s nutritional and physical status in preparation for surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. A program to promote weight gain based on a high-calorie and high-protein diet, in liquid or soft form, is provided if adequate food can be taken by mouth. If this is not possible, parenteral or enteral nutrition is initiated. Nutritional status is monitored throughout treatment. The patient is informed about the nature of the postoperative equipment that will be used, including that required for closed chest drainage, NG suction, parenteral fluid therapy, and gastric intubation.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediate postoperative care is similar to that provided for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. It is not uncommon for patients to have a tracheostomy and be placed in an intensive care unit or step-down unit. After recovering from the effects of anesthesia, the patient is placed in a low Fowler position, and later in a Fowler position, to help prevent reflux of gastric secretions. The patient is observed carefully for regurgitation and dyspnea. A common postoperative complication is aspiration pneumonia (<a href="#bib2963">Brownlee &#x0026; Ferguson, 2018</a>). Therefore, the patient is placed on a vigorous pulmonary plan of care that includes incentive spirometry, sitting up in a chair, and, if necessary, nebulizer treatments. Chest physiotherapy is avoided due to the risk of aspiration. The patient&#x2019;s temperature is monitored to detect any elevation that may indicate aspiration or seepage of fluid through the operative site into the mediastinum, which would indicate an esophageal leak. Drainage from the cervical neck wound, usually saliva, is evidence of an early esophageal leak. Typically, no treatment other than maintaining NPO status and parenteral or enteral support is warranted. The patient is also monitored for a postoperative chylothorax (accumulation of chyle/lymphatic fluid in the pleural cavity), which would require pleural drainage (<a href="#bib2963">Brownlee &#x0026; Ferguson, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib2963">Rudrappa &#x0026; Paul, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiac complications include atrial fibrillation, which occurs due to irritation of the vagus nerve at the time of surgery. Typical medical management includes digitalization or the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and/or cardioversion depending on the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic status (<a href="#bib2963">Brownlee &#x0026; Ferguson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Esophageal anastomotic leak is managed by facilitating adequate drainage, initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics (often including antifungal agents), and optimizing nutrition via enteral or parenteral feeding (<a href="#bib2963">Brownlee &#x0026; Ferguson, 2018</a>). During surgery, an NG tube is inserted and taped in place. It is connected to low intermittent suction. The NG tube is not manipulated; if displacement occurs, it is not replaced because damage to the anastomosis may occur. The NG tube is typically removed 5 days after surgery; before the patient is allowed to eat, a barium swallow is performed to assess for any anastomotic leak.</p>
<p class="indent">Once feeding begins, the nurse encourages the patient to swallow small sips of water. Eventually, the diet is advanced as tolerated to a soft, mechanical diet. When the patient can increase food and fluid intake to an adequate amount, parenteral fluids are discontinued. After each meal, the patient remains upright for at least 2 hours to allow the food to move through the GI tract. It is a challenge to encourage the patient to eat because the appetite is usually poor. Family involvement and home-cooked favorite foods may help the patient to eat. Antacids may help patients with gastric distress. Erythromycin, metoclopramide, or domperidone are useful in promoting gastric emptying (<a href="#bib2963">Brownlee &#x0026; Ferguson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If chemotherapy and radiation are part of the therapy, the patient&#x2019;s appetite will be further depressed, and esophagitis may occur, causing pain when food is eaten. Liquid supplements may be more easily tolerated. Surgical adjuncts to esophagectomy that address delayed gastric emptying (a major complication in 15% to 39% of patients after esophagectomy) may promote <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vagotomy syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; gastrointestinal symptoms that includes diarrhea and abdominal cramping, resulting from rapid gastric emptying (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: dumping syndrome)">vagotomy syndrome</button></strong> (dumping syndrome), which can occur with each meal or approximately 20 minutes to 2 hours after eating (<a href="#bib2963">Zhang &#x0026; Zhang, 2019</a>). Vagotomy syndrome occurs due to interruption of vagal nerve fibers, which in turn causes an alteration in the storage function of the stomach and the pyloric emptying mechanism. As a result, large amounts of solids and liquids rapidly &#x201C;dump&#x201D; into the duodenum. The patient experiences severe abdominal cramping, followed by a liquid bowel movement that may or may not be associated with diaphoresis, rapid heart rate or rapid respirations, or both. It can be quite disabling but typically resolves without incident, and the patient is left feeling extremely tired. As the patient&#x2019;s recovery progresses and the patient begins to eat soft foods and remains in an upright position for 2 hours after eating, the frequency and severity of episodes decrease.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1262</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1263" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1263">p. 1263</span></div>
<p class="indent">Often, in either the preoperative or the postoperative period, an obstructed or nearly obstructed esophagus causes difficulty with excess saliva, and drooling becomes a problem. Oral suction may be used if the patient cannot manage oral secretions, or a wick-type gauze may be placed at the corner of the mouth to direct secretions to a dressing or emesis basin. The possibility that the patient may aspirate saliva into the tracheobronchial tree and develop pneumonia is a concern.</p>
<p class="indent">When the patient is ready to go home, the family is instructed about how to promote nutrition, what observations to make, what measures to take if complications occur, how to keep the patient comfortable, and how to obtain needed physical and emotional support.</p>
