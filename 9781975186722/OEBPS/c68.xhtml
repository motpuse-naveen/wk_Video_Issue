<p class="nonindent">Health care facilities must be prepared for any type of disaster. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;disaster:&lt;/b&gt; a sudden disruption or event that interrupts the functioning of a community">disaster</button></strong> is a sudden disruption or event that interrupts the functioning of a community (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). This chapter focuses on disaster preparedness and the role of the nurse in preparing for and responding to disasters. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;disaster nursing:&lt;/b&gt; adaptation of nursing knowledge and skills to recognize and meet the health needs of individuals during times of crises">Disaster nursing</button></strong> requires the adaptation of nursing knowledge and skills to recognize and meet the health and emotional needs of individuals during such times of crises known as disasters. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2219" title="2219"></span>Nurses serve on the frontline in providing care during a disaster or health crisis; they are called upon to work through difficult situations, sometimes with limited resources. They must utilize innovative thinking, lead effective coordination efforts, and clearly communicate the needs of their patients as well as their own personal needs (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). Nursing responsibilities include preparing for and managing patients harmed by the effects of all disasters, including natural disasters, outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, as well as injuries and illnesses that can occur after biologic, chemical, and nuclear or radiation incidents, which may result from attacks of terrorism. Information about the process that nurses should follow in order to respond to these emergencies is applicable to other types of disasters as well.</p>
