<p class="nonindent">Adequate perfusion ensures oxygenation and nourishment of body tissues, and it depends in part on a properly functioning cardiovascular system. Adequate blood flow depends on the efficiency of the heart as a pump, the patency and responsiveness of the blood vessels, and the adequacy of circulating blood volume. Nervous system activity, blood viscosity, and the metabolic needs of tissues influence the rate and adequacy of blood flow.</p>
<p class="indent">The vascular system consists of two interdependent systems. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs to the pulmonary circulation, and the left side of the heart pumps blood to all other body tissues through the systemic circulation. The blood vessels in both systems channel the blood from the heart to the tissues and back to the heart (see <a href="#ff26-1">Fig. 26-1</a>). Contraction of the ventricles is the driving force that moves blood through the vascular system.</p>

The deoxygenated blood returns to the right heart by way of the systemic veins and is pumped into the pulmonary circulation.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Arteries distribute oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to the tissues, whereas the veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues to the right side of the heart. Capillary vessels located within the tissues connect the arterial and venous systems. These vessels permit the exchange of nutrients and metabolic wastes between the circulatory system and the tissues. Arterioles and venules immediately adjacent to the capillaries, together with the capillaries, make up the microcirculation.</p>
<p class="indent">The lymphatic system complements the function of the circulatory system. Lymphatic vessels transport lymph (a fluid similar to plasma) and tissue fluids (containing proteins, cells, and cellular debris) from the interstitial space to systemic veins. Lymphatic fluid empties into the subclavian and internal jugular veins.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s946">Anatomy of the Vascular System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins, venules, and lymphatic vessels are the main structures that comprise the vascular system.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Arteries and Arterioles</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Arteries are thick-walled structures that carry blood from the heart to the tissues. The aorta, which has a diameter of approximately 2.5 cm (1 inch) in the average-sized adult, gives rise to numerous branches, which continue to divide into progressively smaller arteries that are 4 mm (0.16 inches) in diameter. The vessels divide further, diminishing in size to approximately 30 mcm in diameter. These smallest arteries, called <em>arterioles,</em> are generally embedded within the tissues (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The walls of the arteries and arterioles are composed of three layers: the intima, an inner endothelial cell layer; the media, a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue; and the adventitia, an outer layer of connective tissue. The intima, a very thin layer, provides a smooth surface for contact with the flowing blood. The media makes up most of the vessel wall in the aorta and other large arteries of the body. This layer is composed chiefly of elastic and connective tissue fibers that give the vessels considerable strength and allow them to constrict and dilate to accommodate the blood ejected from the heart during each cardiac cycle (stroke volume) and maintain an even, steady flow of blood. The adventitia is a layer of connective tissue that anchors the vessel to its surroundings. There is much less elastic tissue in the smaller arteries and arterioles, and the media in these vessels is composed primarily of smooth muscle (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>). Smooth muscle controls the diameter of the vessels by contracting and relaxing. Chemical, hormonal, and neuronal factors influence the activity of smooth muscle. Arterioles offer resistance to blood flow by altering their diameter and are often referred to as resistance vessels. Arterioles regulate the volume and pressure in the arterial system and the rate of blood flow to the capillaries. There is a large amount of smooth muscle in the media, and the walls of the arteries are relatively thick, accounting for approximately 25% of the total diameter of the artery.</p>
<p class="indent">The intima and the inner third of the smooth muscle layer of the media are in such close contact with the blood that the blood vessels receive their nourishment by direct diffusion. The adventitia and the outer media layers require <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page819" title="819"></span>their own blood supply to meet metabolic needs. The vasa vasorum is a network of small blood vessels that supplies blood and nutrients to the larger arteries.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Capillaries</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The walls of the capillaries, which lack smooth muscle and adventitia, are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells. This thin-walled structure permits rapid and efficient transport of nutrients to the cells and removal of metabolic wastes. The diameter of capillaries ranges from 5 to 10 mcm; this means that red blood cells must alter their shape to pass through these vessels. Changes in a capillary&#x2019;s diameter are passive and are influenced by contractile changes in the blood vessels that carry blood to and from a capillary. The capillary&#x2019;s diameter also changes in response to chemical stimuli. In some tissues, a cuff of smooth muscle, called the <em>precapillary sphincter,</em> is located at the arteriolar end of the capillary and is responsible, along with the arteriole, for controlling capillary blood flow (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some capillary beds, such as those in the fingertips, contain arteriovenous anastomoses, through which blood passes directly from the arterial to the venous system. These vessels are believed to regulate heat exchange between the body and the external environment.</p>
<p class="indent">The distribution of capillaries varies with the type of tissue. For example, skeletal tissue, which has high metabolic requirements, has a denser capillary network than cartilage, which has low metabolic needs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Veins and Venules</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Capillaries join to form larger vessels called <em>venules,</em> which join to form veins. The venous system is therefore structurally analogous to the arterial system; venules correspond to arterioles, veins to arteries, and the vena cava to the aorta. Analogous types of vessels in the arterial and venous systems have approximately the same diameters (see <a href="#ff26-1">Fig. 26-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The walls of the veins, in contrast to those of the arteries, are thinner and considerably less muscular. In most veins, the wall makes up only 10% of the diameter, in contrast to 25% in most arteries. In veins, the walls are composed of three layers, like those of arteries; however, in veins, these layers are not as well defined.</p>
<p class="indent">The thin, less muscular structure of the vein wall allows these vessels to distend more than arteries. Greater distensibility and compliance permit large volumes of blood to remain in the veins under low pressure. For this reason, veins are referred to as capacitance vessels. Approximately 75% of total blood volume is contained in the veins. The sympathetic nervous system, which innervates the vein musculature, can stimulate venoconstriction (constriction of the veins), thereby reducing venous volume and increasing the volume of blood in the general circulation. Contraction of skeletal muscles in the extremities creates the primary pumping action to facilitate venous blood flow back to the heart (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some veins, unlike arteries, are equipped with valves. In general, veins that transport blood against the force of gravity, as in the lower extremities, have one-way bicuspid valves that prevent blood from retrograde flow as it is propelled toward the heart. Valves are composed of endothelial leaflets, the competency of which depends on the integrity of the vein wall.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lymphatic Vessels</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The lymphatic vessels are a complex network of thin-walled vessels similar to the capillaries. This network collects lymphatic fluid from tissues and organs, and transports the fluid to the venous circulation. The lymphatic vessels converge into two main structures: the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct. These ducts empty into the junction of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. The right lymphatic duct conveys lymph primarily from the right side of the head, neck, thorax, and upper arms. The thoracic duct conveys lymph from the remainder of the body. Peripheral lymphatic vessels join larger lymph vessels and pass through regional lymph nodes before entering the venous circulation. The lymph nodes play an important role in filtering foreign particles.</p>
<p class="indent">The lymphatic vessels are permeable to large molecules and provide the only means by which interstitial proteins can return to the venous system. With muscular contraction, lymph vessels become distorted to create spaces between the endothelial cells, allowing protein and particles to enter. Muscular contraction of the lymphatic walls and surrounding tissues aids in propelling the lymph toward the venous drainage points (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s947">Function of the Vascular System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Important functions of the vascular system include supplying the circulatory needs of tissue, maintaining blood flow and blood pressure, and providing capillary filtration and reabsorption, hemodynamic resistance, and other peripheral vascular regulating mechanisms.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Circulatory Needs of Tissues</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The amount of blood flow needed by the body&#x2019;s tissues constantly changes. The percentage of blood flow received by individual organs or tissues is determined by the rate of tissue metabolism, the availability of oxygen, and the function of the tissue. When metabolic requirements increase, blood vessels dilate to increase the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. When metabolic needs decrease, vessels constrict and blood flow to the tissues decreases. Metabolic demands of tissues increase with physical activity or exercise, local heat application, fever, and infection. Reduced metabolic requirements of tissues accompany rest or decreased physical activity, local cold application, and cooling of the body. If the blood vessels fail to dilate in response to the need for increased blood flow, tissue <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ischemia:&lt;/b&gt; insufficient tissue oxygenation">ischemia</button></strong> (deficient blood supply to a body part) results. The mechanism by which blood vessels dilate and constrict to adjust for metabolic changes ensures that normal arterial pressure is maintained (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As blood passes through tissue capillaries, oxygen is removed and carbon dioxide is added. The amount of oxygen extracted by each type of tissue differs. For example, the myocardium tends to extract about 50% of the oxygen from arterial blood in one pass through its capillary bed, whereas the kidneys extract only about 7% of the oxygen from the blood that passes through them. The average amount of oxygen removed collectively by all of the body tissues is about 25%. This means that the blood in the vena cava contains about 25% less oxygen than aortic blood. This is known as the systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>). This difference becomes greater when less oxygen is delivered to the tissues than they need.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 819</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page820" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="820">p. 820</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Blood Flow</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Blood flow through the cardiovascular system always proceeds in the same direction: left side of the heart to the aorta, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins, vena cava, and right side of the heart. This unidirectional flow is caused by a pressure difference that exists between the arterial and venous systems. Because arterial pressure (approximately 100&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg) is greater than venous pressure (approximately 40&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg) and fluid flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure, blood flows from the arterial system to the venous system.</p>
<p class="indent">The pressure difference (&#x0394;P) between the two ends of the vessel propels the blood. Impediments to blood flow exert an opposing force, which is known as resistance (R). The rate of blood flow is determined by dividing the pressure difference by the resistance:</p>
<p class="center2">Flow rate = &#x0394;P/R</p>
<p class="indent">This equation shows that when resistance increases, a greater pressure is required to maintain the same degree of flow (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>). In the body, an increase in pressure is accomplished by an increase in the force of contraction of the heart. If arterial resistance is chronically elevated, the myocardium hypertrophies (enlarges) to sustain a greater contractile force.</p>
<p class="indent">In most long, smooth blood vessels, flow is laminar or streamlined, with blood in the center of the vessel moving slightly faster than the blood near the vessel walls. Laminar flow becomes turbulent when the blood flow rate increases, when blood viscosity increases, when the diameter of the vessel becomes greater than normal, or when segments of the vessel are narrowed or constricted (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>). Turbulent blood flow creates an abnormal sound, called a <strong>bruit</strong>, which can be heard with a stethoscope.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Blood Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> provides more information on the physiology and measurement of blood pressure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Capillary Filtration and Reabsorption</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid exchange across the capillary wall is continuous. This fluid, which has the same composition as plasma without the proteins, forms the interstitial fluid. The equilibrium between hydrostatic and osmotic forces of the blood and interstitium, as well as capillary permeability, determines the amount and direction of fluid movement across the capillary. Hydrostatic force is a driving pressure that is generated by the blood pressure. Osmotic pressure is the pulling force created by plasma proteins. Normally, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of the capillary is relatively high compared with that at the venous end. This high pressure at the arterial end of the capillaries tends to drive fluid out of the capillary and into the tissue space. Osmotic pressure tends to pull fluid back into the capillary from the tissue space, but this osmotic force cannot overcome the high hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of the capillary. However, at the venous end of the capillary, the osmotic force predominates over the low hydrostatic pressure, and there is a net reabsorption of fluid from the tissue space back into the capillary (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Except for a very small amount, fluid that is filtered out at the arterial end of the capillary bed is reabsorbed at the venous end. The excess filtered fluid enters the lymphatic circulation. These processes of filtration, reabsorption, and lymph formation aid in maintaining tissue fluid volume and removing tissue waste and debris. Under normal conditions, capillary permeability remains constant.</p>
<p class="indent">Under certain abnormal conditions, the fluid filtered out of the capillaries may greatly exceed the amounts reabsorbed and carried away by the lymphatic vessels. This imbalance can result from damage to capillary walls and subsequent increased permeability, obstruction of lymphatic drainage, elevation of venous pressure, or a decrease in plasma protein osmotic force. Accumulation of excess interstitial fluid that results from these processes is called <em>edema.</em></p>
<h6 class="h6">Hemodynamic Resistance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most important factor that determines resistance in the vascular system is the vessel radius. Small changes in vessel radius lead to large changes in resistance. The predominant sites of change in the caliber or width of blood vessels, and therefore in resistance, are the arterioles and the precapillary sphincter. Peripheral vascular resistance is the opposition to blood flow provided by the blood vessels. This resistance is proportional to the viscosity or thickness of the blood and the length of the vessel and is influenced by the diameter of the vessels. Under normal conditions, blood viscosity and vessel length do not change significantly, and these factors do not usually play an important role in blood flow. However, a large increase in hematocrit may increase blood viscosity and reduce capillary blood flow.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Peripheral Vascular Regulating Mechanisms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Even at rest, the metabolic needs of body tissues are continuously changing. Therefore, an integrated and coordinated regulatory system is necessary so that blood flow to individual tissues is maintained in proportion to the needs of those tissues. This regulatory mechanism is complex and consists of central nervous system influences, circulating hormones and chemicals, and independent activity of the arterial wall itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Sympathetic (adrenergic) nervous system activity, mediated by the hypothalamus, is the most important factor in regulating the caliber and therefore the blood flow of peripheral blood vessels. All vessels are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system except the capillary and precapillary sphincters. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction. The neurotransmitter responsible for sympathetic vasoconstriction is norepinephrine (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>). Sympathetic activation occurs in response to physiologic and psychological stressors. Diminution of sympathetic activity by medications or sympathectomy results in vasodilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Other hormones affect peripheral vascular resistance. Epinephrine, released from the adrenal medulla, acts like norepinephrine in constricting peripheral blood vessels in most tissue beds. However, in low concentrations, epinephrine causes vasodilation in skeletal muscles, the heart, and the brain. Angiotensin I, which is formed from the interaction of renin (synthesized by the kidney) and angiotensinogen, a circulating serum protein, is then converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme secreted by the pulmonary vasculature, called <em>angiotensin-converting enzyme</em> (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, particularly of the arterioles. Although the amount of angiotensin II concentrated in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page821" title="821"></span>the blood is usually small, its profound vasoconstrictive effects are important in certain abnormal states, such as heart failure and hypovolemia (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Alterations in local blood flow are influenced by various circulating substances that have vasoactive properties. Potent vasodilators include nitric oxide, prostacyclin, histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandin, and certain muscle metabolites. A reduction in available oxygen and nutrients and changes in local pH also affect local blood flow. Proinflammatory cytokines are substances liberated from platelets that aggregate at the site of damaged vessels, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction and continued platelet aggregation at the site of injury (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1912">Atherton, Sindone, De Pasquale, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s948">Pathophysiology of the Vascular System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Reduced blood flow through peripheral blood vessels characterizes all peripheral vascular diseases. The physiologic effects of altered blood flow depend on the extent to which tissue demands exceed the supply of oxygen and nutrients available. If tissue needs are high, even modestly reduced blood flow may be inadequate to maintain tissue integrity. Tissues become ischemic, malnourished, and ultimately die unless adequate blood flow is restored.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pump Failure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Inadequate peripheral blood flow occurs when the heart&#x2019;s pumping action becomes inefficient. Heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF; also called systolic HF) causes an accumulation of blood in the lungs and a reduction in forward flow or cardiac output, which results in inadequate arterial blood flow to the tissues. Heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF; also called diastolic HF) causes systemic venous congestion and a reduction in forward flow (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Atherton et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Alterations in Blood and Lymphatic Vessels</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intact, patent, and responsive blood vessels are necessary to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and to remove metabolic wastes. Arteries can become damaged or obstructed as a result of atherosclerotic plaque, a <strong>thromboembolus</strong> (a blood clot that may become dislodged from the vessel from where it originally formed), chemical or mechanical trauma, infections or inflammatory processes, vasospastic disorders, and congenital malformations. A sudden arterial occlusion causes profound and often irreversible tissue ischemia and tissue death. When arterial occlusions develop gradually, there is less risk of sudden tissue death because collateral circulation may develop, giving that tissue the opportunity to adapt to gradually decreased blood flow.</p>
<p class="indent">Venous blood flow can be reduced by a thromboembolus obstructing the vein, by incompetent venous valves, or by a reduction in the effectiveness of the pumping action of surrounding muscles. Decreased venous blood flow results in increased venous pressure, a subsequent increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure, net filtration of fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, and subsequent edema. Edematous tissues cannot receive adequate nutrition from the blood and consequently are more susceptible to breakdown, injury, and infection. Obstruction of lymphatic vessels also results in edema. Lymphatic vessels can become obstructed by a tumor or by damage from mechanical trauma or inflammatory processes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Circulatory Insufficiency of the Extremities</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although many types of peripheral vascular diseases exist, most result in ischemia and produce some of the same symptoms: pain, skin changes, diminished pulses, and possible edema. The type and severity of symptoms depend in part on the type, stage, and extent of the disease process and on the speed with which the disorder develops. <a href="#tt26-1">Table 26-1</a> highlights the distinguishing features of arterial and venous insufficiency. In this chapter, peripheral vascular disease is categorized as arterial, venous, or lymphatic.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s949"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aging produces changes in the walls of the blood vessels that affect the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page822" title="822"></span>The intima thickens as a result of cellular proliferation and fibrosis. Elastin fibers of the media become calcified, thin, and fragmented, and collagen accumulates in the intima and the media. These changes cause the vessels to stiffen, which results in increased peripheral resistance, impaired blood flow, and increased left ventricular workload causing hypertrophy, ischemia and HFrEF, and thrombosis along with hemorrhage in the microvessels in the brain and kidney (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Atherton et al., 2018</a>).</p>
