<p class="nonindent">Thoracic injuries occurred in over 194,622 patients and accounted for 22.58% of the types of trauma recently recorded in a national trauma database (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1454">American College of Surgeons, 2016</a>). Four of the top 10 complications in trauma patients were related to the respiratory system: pneumonia, DVT/PE, unplanned extubation, and acute lung injury/ARDS (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1454">American College of Surgeons, 2016</a>). Major chest trauma may occur alone or in combination with multiple other injuries. Chest trauma is classified as either blunt or penetrating. Blunt chest trauma results from sudden compression or positive pressure inflicted to the chest wall. Penetrating trauma occurs when a foreign object penetrates the chest wall.</p>
