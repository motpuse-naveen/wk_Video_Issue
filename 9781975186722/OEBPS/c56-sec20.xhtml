<h4 class="h4" id="s2657">Pemphigus Vulgaris</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by the appearance of bullae of various sizes on apparently normal skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease in which the IgG antibody is directed against a specific cell surface antigen in epidermal cells causing separation between the epidermis and dermis with subsequent blister formation (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>). The blisters form from the antigen&#x2013;antibody reaction. The level of serum antibody is predictive of disease severity. Genetic factors may also have a role in its development, with the highest incidence in people of Jewish or Mediterranean descent. This disorder usually occurs in men and women in middle and late adulthood (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Hertl &#x0026; Sitaru, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2658">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients present with oral lesions appearing as irregularly shaped erosions that are painful, bleed easily, and heal slowly. The skin bullae enlarge, rupture, and leave large, painful eroded areas that are accompanied by crusting and oozing. A characteristic odor emanates from the bullae and the exuding serum. There is blistering or sloughing of uninvolved skin when minimal pressure is applied (Nikolsky sign). The eroded skin heals slowly, and large areas of the body eventually are involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Specimens from the blister and surrounding skin demonstrate <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;acantholysis:&lt;/b&gt; separation of epidermal cells from each other due to damage or abnormality of the intracellular substance">acantholysis</button></strong> (separation of epidermal cells from each other because of damage to or an abnormality of the intracellular substance), and immunofluorescent studies show intraepidermal presence of IgG (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The most common complications arise when the disease process is widespread. Skin bacteria have relatively easy access to the bullae as they ooze, rupture, and leave denuded areas exposed to the environment. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance results from fluid and protein loss as the bullae rupture.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2659">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of therapy are to bring the disease under control as rapidly as possible, to prevent loss of serum and the development of secondary infection, and to promote reepithelization (i.e., renewal of epithelial tissue).</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroids are given to control the disease and keep the skin free of blisters. The dosage level is maintained until remission is apparent. Immunosuppressive agents (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) are prescribed early in the course of the disease to help control the disease and reduce the corticosteroid dose. The monoclonal antibody rituximab may be chosen as an alternative agent, as well as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The immunosuppressant agent cyclophosphamide may be tried when other medications fail to induce remission (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Hertl &#x0026; Geller, 2020</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Kridin, 2018</a>).</p>
