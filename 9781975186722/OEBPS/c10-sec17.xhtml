<p class="nonindent">When patients cannot take oral fluid or oral feedings, their status is termed NPO (<em>nil per os</em>), meaning nothing by mouth. In patients who are NPO, <strong>parenteral fluid therapy</strong>, also termed IV fluid therapy, is used to administer fluids. IV fluid therapy can be initiated to replace fluids in various clinical settings such as hospitals, outpatient diagnostic and surgical settings, clinics, and home health care. IV fluids can also be used to administer medications and provide nutrients.</p>
