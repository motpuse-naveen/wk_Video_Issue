<h4 class="h4" id="s1266">Assessment of the Immune System</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An assessment of immune function begins during the health history and physical examination. Areas to be assessed include nutritional status; infections and immunizations; allergies; disorders and disease states, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, and chronic illnesses; surgeries; medications; and blood transfusions. In addition to inspection of general characteristics, palpation of the lymph nodes and examinations of the skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, cardiovascular, and neurosensory systems are performed (<a href="#ct31-3">Chart 31-3</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1267">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The history should note the patient&#x2019;s age along with information about past and present conditions and events that may provide clues to the status of the patient&#x2019;s immune system.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gender</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are differences in the immune system functions of men and women. For example, many autoimmune diseases have a higher incidence in females than in males, a phenomenon believed to be correlated with sex hormones. In the past two decades, research has revealed that sex hormones are integral signaling modulators of the immune system. Sex hormones play definitive roles in lymphocyte maturation, activation, and synthesis of antibodies and cytokines. In autoimmune disease, expression of sex hormones is altered, and this change contributes to immune dysregulation (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Rainville, Tsyglakova, &#x0026; Hodes, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immunosenescence:&lt;/b&gt; the gradual deterioration of the immune system brought on by the aging process">Immunosenescence</button></strong> is the term for age-related changes in the immune system. These changes have been linked to the increased rates of illness and mortality in older adults (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Tariq, Hazeldine, &#x0026; Lord, 2017</a>). Some of the changes that occur in immunosenescence include, but are not limited to, bone marrow defects, dysfunction of the thymus gland, and impaired lymphocytes. Cellular changes occur as the result of aging and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page997" title="997"></span>include impaired neutrophil function, decreased circulating macrophages, impaired dendritic cell function, and reduced T-cell activation. As the immune system undergoes age-associated alterations, its response to infections progressively deteriorates. The capacity for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells diminishes. There is a notable decline in the total number of phagocytes, coupled with an intrinsic reduction in their activity. The cytotoxicity of NK cells decreases, contributing to a decline in humoral immunity (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2272">Tariq et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Inflammatory cytokines also tend to increase with age. Acquired immunity may be negatively affected as the efficacy of vaccines is frequently decreased in older adults (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2303">Smetana, Chlibek, Shaw, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Older adults have an increased incidence of infections, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, osteoporosis, and neurologic disorders (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2272">Tariq et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The increased incidence of autoimmune diseases may be from a decreased ability of antibodies to differentiate between self and non-self. Failure of the surveillance system to recognize mutant or abnormal cells may also be responsible, in part, for the high incidence of cancer associated with increasing age.</p>
<p class="indent">Age-related changes in many body systems also contribute to impaired immunity (<a href="#tt31-4">Table 31-4</a>). For example, postmenopausal females are at a greater risk for urinary tract infections due to residual urine, urinary incontinence, and estrogen deficiency (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Jung &#x0026; Brubaker, 2019</a>). Secondary changes, including malnutrition and poor circulation, as well as the breakdown of natural mechanical barriers such as the skin, place the aging immune system at even greater disadvantage against infection (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2272">Tariq et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The effects of the aging process and psychological stress interact, with the potential to negatively influence immune integrity (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Gidron, 2019</a>). Consequently, continual assessment of the physical and emotional status of older adults is imperative, because early recognition and management of factors influencing immune response may prevent or mitigate the high morbidity and mortality seen with illness in the older adult population.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nutritional status is a key determinant of health. Traditionally, the relationship between infection and nutrition focused on the effect of nutrients on host defenses and the effect of infection on nutritional needs (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Yaqoob, 2017</a>). This has expanded in scope to encompass the role of specific nutrients in acquired immune function&#x2014;the modulation of inflammatory processes and the virulence of the infectious agent itself (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Lang &#x0026; Aspinall, 2017</a>). Iron and the immune system are linked in homeostasis and pathology, thus making it essential for maximum function (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2288">Martins, Almeida, Lima, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The list of nutrients affecting infection, immunity, inflammation, and cell injury has expanded from traditional proteins to several vitamins, multiple minerals, and, more recently, specific lipid components of the diet. The role of micronutrients and fatty acids on the response of cells and tissues to hypoxic and toxic damage has been recognized, suggesting that there is another dimension to the relationship. Deficiencies in micronutrients have been connected to impairment in various body functions, including immunity (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Carr &#x0026; Maggini, 2017</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Mikkelsen &#x0026; Apostolopoulos, 2018</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page998" title="998"></span>Zinc deficiency in particular has been linked to the development of a number of diseases. Zinc plays an important role in homeostasis, immune function, and apoptosis, among other functions (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Wessels, Maywald, &#x0026; Rink, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The effects exerted by polyunsaturated fatty acids on immune system functions are under investigation. Studies suggest that these elements play a role in diminishing the incidence and severity of inflammatory disorders. Research suggests that diets high in olive oil are not as immunosuppressive as diets rich in fish oil. The contribution of immune modulation by lipids to the high risk of infectious complications associated with the use of parenteral nutrition is unclear (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2295">Raman, Almutairdi, Mulesa, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Depletion of protein reserves results in atrophy of lymphoid tissues, depression of antibody response, reduction in the number of circulating T cells, and impaired phagocytic function. As a result, susceptibility to infection is greatly increased. During periods of infection or serious illness, nutritional requirements may be further altered, potentially contributing to depletion of protein, fatty acid, vitamin, and trace elements and causing even greater risk of impaired immune response and sepsis (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Wischmeyer, 2018</a>). Nutritional intake that supports a competent immune response plays an important role in reducing the incidence of infections (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2301">Shlisky, Bloom, Beaudreault, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>); patients whose nutritional status is compromised have a delayed postoperative recovery and often experience more severe infections and delayed wound healing. There is evidence that nutrition plays a role in the development of cancer and that diet and lifestyle can alter the risk of cancer development as well as other chronic diseases (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2304">Theodoratou, Timofeeva, Li, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The nurse must assume a proactive role in ensuring the best possible nutritional intake for all patients as a vital step in preventing disease and poor outcomes. The nurse must assess the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status, caloric intake, and quality of foods ingested (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for further discussion of nutritional assessment).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Immunization</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is asked about childhood and adult immunizations, including vaccinations to provide protection against influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster, pertussis, and the usual childhood diseases (e.g., measles, mumps). Education about the importance of adhering to the recommended schedule for adult vaccines should be initiated. See <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="c03-sec05.xhtml#tt3-3">Table 3-3</a>: Select Health Promotion Screening for Adults for more information about adult immunizations.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A history of past and present infections and the dates and types of treatments, along with a history of any multiple persistent infections, fevers of unknown origin, lesions or sores, or any type of drainage, as well as the response to treatment, are obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Known past or present exposure to tuberculosis is assessed, and the dates and results of any tuberculin tests (purified protein derivative [PPD] test) and chest x-rays are documented. Recent exposure to any infections, recent travel, and dates are elicited. The nurse must assess whether the patient has been exposed to any sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis B, C, and D viruses and human immune deficiency virus (HIV). A history of STIs such as gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus infection, and chlamydia can alert the nurse that the patient may have been exposed to HIV or hepatitis. Herpes simplex virus infections have a significant impact on health, causing a wide range of diseases (e.g., oral and genital herpes).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Allergy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is asked about any allergies, including types of allergens (e.g., pollens, dust, plants, cosmetics, food, medications, vaccines, latex), the symptoms experienced, and seasonal variations in occurrence or severity in the symptoms. A history of testing and treatments, including prescribed and over-the-counter medications that the patient has taken or is currently taking for these allergies and the effectiveness of the treatments, is obtained. All medication and food allergies are listed on paper records with an allergy alert sticker or within the patient&#x2019;s electronic health record (EHR) to make others aware of these allergies. Continued assessment for potential allergic reactions in the patient is vital. See <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> for more information on allergies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Disorders and Diseases</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Part of the focused immunologic assessment includes determining whether the patient has a history of autoimmune disorders, neoplasms, chronic illnesses, surgeries, or any recent major stressors that may place the patient at increased risk.</p>
<p class="h7">Autoimmune Disorders</p>
<p class="nonindent">Autoimmune disorders affect people of both genders of all ages, ethnicities, and social classes. Autoimmune disorders are a group of disorders that can affect almost any cell or tissue in the body (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Norris, 2019</a>). As mentioned previously, they tend to be more common in women because estrogen tends to enhance immunity. Androgen, on the other hand, tends to be immunosuppressive. Autoimmune diseases are a leading cause of death by disease in females of reproductive age.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is asked about any autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or psoriasis. The onset, severity, remissions and exacerbations, functional limitations, treatments that the patient has received or is currently receiving, and effectiveness of the treatments are described. Certain autoimmune diseases appear to be genetically linked, so a family history of these is important (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2278">Generali, Ceribelli, Stazi, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (<a href="#ct31-4">Chart 31-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Neoplastic Disease</p>
<p class="nonindent">If there is a history of cancer in the family, more information is obtained, including the type of cancer, age at onset, and relationship (maternal or paternal) of the patient to the affected family members. Dates and results of any cancer screening tests for the patient are documented.</p>
<p class="indent">A history of cancer in the patient is also obtained, along with the type of cancer, date of diagnosis, and treatment modalities used. Immunosuppression contributes to the development of cancers; however, cancer itself is immunosuppressive, as are many treatments for cancer. Large tumors can release antigens into the blood, and these antigens combine with circulating antibodies and prevent them from attacking the tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor cells may possess special <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page999" title="999"></span>blocking factors that coat tumor cells and prevent their destruction by killer T lymphocytes. During the early development of tumors, the body may fail to recognize the tumor antigens as foreign and subsequently fail to initiate destruction of the malignant cells. Hematologic cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, are associated with altered production and function of WBCs and lymphocytes.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Immunologic Disorders</strong></p>
<p class="Box8pPARA">An immunologic disorder is a disorder of a person&#x2019;s immune system, which is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against attacks by foreign invaders such as bacteria, parasites, and fungi that can cause infection. A number of immunologic disorders have a known inheritance pattern, while others are noted to have a genetic abnormality that is influenced by environmental exposures. Therefore, the pattern of inheritance is unclear in some immunologic disorders. Examples of immunologic disorders caused by a genetic abnormality include:</p>

<p class="indent">All treatments that the patient has received or is currently receiving, such as radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, are recorded in the health history. In addition, the nurse should elicit information related to complementary or alternative modalities that have been used and the response to these efforts. Radiation destroys lymphocytes and decreases the ability to mount an effective immune response. The size and extent of the irradiated area determine the extent of immunosuppression. Whole-body irradiation may leave the patient completely immunosuppressed. Chemotherapy and other cancer treatments also affect bone marrow function, destroying cells that contribute to an effective immune response and resulting in immunosuppression. Immunotherapy can cause inflammatory overreactions of the immune system that mimic autoimmune disorders (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2282">Kroschinsky, Stolzel, von Bonin, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Munro, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Chronic Illness and Surgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">The health assessment includes a history of chronic illness, particularly diabetes, renal disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The onset and severity of illnesses, as well as treatment that the patient is receiving for the illness, are obtained. Chronic illness may contribute to immune system impairments in various ways. Kidney injury is associated with a deficiency in circulating lymphocytes. In addition, immune defenses may be altered by acidosis and uremic toxins. In diabetes, an increased incidence of infection has been associated with vascular insufficiency, neuropathy, and poor control of serum glucose levels. Recurrent respiratory tract infections are associated with COPD due to altered inspiratory and expiratory function and ineffective airway clearance. In addition, a history of organ transplantation or surgical removal of the spleen, lymph nodes, or thymus should be noted, because these conditions may place the patient at risk for impaired immune function (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2273">Bagatini, Cardoso, dos Santos, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2277">Dionne, Dehority, Brett, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Special Problems</p>
<p class="nonindent">Conditions such as burns and other forms of injury and infection may contribute to altered immune system function. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1000" title="1000"></span>Major burns cause impaired skin integrity and compromise the body&#x2019;s first line of defense. Loss of large amounts of serum occurs with burn injuries and depletes the body of essential proteins, including immunoglobulins.</p>
<p class="indent">The physiologic and psychological stressors associated with surgery or injury stimulate cortisol release from the adrenal cortex; increased serum cortisol also contributes to suppression of normal immune responses. The immune system&#x2019;s inflammatory response to surgery is followed by an anti-inflammatory compensatory response, and it is thought that these responses may contribute to postoperative complications (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Cerra, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at risk for infection following the event. Evidence suggests that an acute stroke leads to immunosuppression and a subsequently high infection risk; infection is the leading cause of death following a stroke (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2280">Hoffmann, Harms, Ulm, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Stroke-induced immunosuppression is linked to the development of stroke-associated pneumonia, which is the most common infection seen in patients who have had a stroke (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2286">Liu, Chu, Chen, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Medications and Blood Transfusions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A list of past and present medications is obtained. In large doses, antibiotics, corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anesthetic agents can cause immune suppression (<a href="#tt31-5">Table 31-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A history of blood transfusions is obtained; previous exposure to foreign antigens through transfusion may be associated with abnormal immune function. In addition, although the risk of HIV transmission through blood transfusion is extremely low in patients who received a transfusion after 1985 (when testing of blood for HIV was initiated in the United States), a small risk remains.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is also asked about the use of herbal agents and over-the-counter medications. Because many herbal agents have not been subjected to rigorous testing, their effects have not been fully identified. It is important, therefore, to ask patients about their use of these substances, to document their use, and to educate patients about untoward effects that may alter immune responsiveness.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lifestyle Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Personal lifestyle choices have an impact on the immune system. Poor nutritional intake, smoking (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2293">Qiu, Liang, Liu, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>), excessive consumption of alcohol (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2296">Rehm, Gmel, Gmel, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>), illicit drug use, and occupational or residential exposure to environmental radiation and pollutants have been associated with impaired immune function and are assessed in a detailed patient history. Although factors that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1001" title="1001"></span>are not consistent with a healthy lifestyle are predominately responsible for ineffective immune function, positive lifestyle factors can also negatively affect immune function and require assessment. For example, rigorous exercise or competitive exercise&#x2014;usually considered a positive lifestyle factor&#x2014;can be a physiologic stressor and cause negative effects on immune response (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Aoi &#x0026; Naito, 2019</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2300">Shaw, Merien, Braakhuis, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Psychoneuroimmunologic Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The bidirectional pathway between the brain and immune system (the mind&#x2013;body system) is referred to as psychoneuroimmunology. Patient assessment must also address psychoneuroimmunologic factors, such as stress and psychological illness, that may be influencing the patient&#x2019;s health. The immune response is regulated and modulated in part by neuroendocrine influences. Lymphocytes and macrophages have receptors that can respond to neurotransmitters and endocrine hormones. Lymphocytes can produce and secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone and endorphinlike compounds. Cells in the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, can recognize prostaglandins, interferons, and interleukins, as well as histamine and serotonin, all of which are released during the inflammatory process. Like all other biologic systems functioning to maintain homeostasis, the immune system is integrated with other psychophysiologic processes and is regulated and modulated by the brain. These relationships may have immunologic consequences (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2284">Lasselin, Schedlowski, Lekander, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Growing evidence indicates that a measurable immune system response can be positively influenced by biobehavioral strategies such as relaxation, imagery techniques, biofeedback, humor, hypnosis, mindfulness-based strategies, and yoga (<a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Park &#x0026; Han, 2017</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2314">Pascoe, Thompson, &#x0026; Ski, 2017</a>; <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#bib2297">Reich, Lengacher, Klein, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Therefore, the assessment should address the patient&#x2019;s general psychological status and the patient&#x2019;s use of and response to these strategies. See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c31-sec04.xhtml#ct31-5">Chart 31-5</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1268">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the physical examination (see <a href="#ct31-3">Chart 31-3</a>), the skin and mucous membranes are assessed for lesions, dermatitis, purpura (subcutaneous bleeding), urticaria, inflammation, or any discharge. Any signs of infection are noted. The patient&#x2019;s temperature is recorded, and the patient is observed for chills and sweating. The anterior and posterior cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes are palpated for enlargement; if palpable nodes are detected, their location, size, consistency, and reports of tenderness on palpation are noted. Joints are assessed for tenderness, swelling, increased warmth, and limited range of motion. The patient&#x2019;s respiratory, cardiovascular, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and neurosensory systems are evaluated for signs and symptoms indicative of immune dysfunction. Any functional limitations or disabilities the patient may have are also assessed.</p>
