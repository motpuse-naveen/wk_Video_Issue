<h4 class="h4" id="s892">SURGICAL MANAGEMENT: VALVE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT PROCEDURES</h4>
<h4 class="h4" id="s893">Valvuloplasty</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Repair, rather than replacement, of a cardiac valve is referred to as valvuloplasty. The recommended procedure for valvuloplasty will depend on the cause and type of valve dysfunction. Repair may be made to commissures between the leaflets in a procedure known as commissurotomy, to the annulus of the valve by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;annuloplasty:&lt;/b&gt; repair of a cardiac valve&#x2019;s outer ring">annuloplasty</button></strong> (i.e., specifically, repair of the cardiac valve&#x2019;s outer ring), or to leaflets. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is usually performed at the conclusion of a valvuloplasty to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Some valvuloplasty procedures are open-heart surgeries, which are performed under general anesthesia and usually use cardiopulmonary bypass. However, there are now several valvuloplasty procedures which utilize nonsurgical, or percutaneous, techniques; these do not require general anesthesia or cardiopulmonary bypass and can be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory or hybrid room. A hybrid room is an operating room with imaging capability (e.g., fluoroscopy, CT, MRI) and interventional devices for open, minimally invasive, image-guided and catheter-based procedures. Percutaneous partial cardiopulmonary bypass is used in some cardiac catheterization laboratories and hybrid rooms. (Cardiopulmonary bypass is described in Chapter 23.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s894">Commissurotomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Valve leaflets may adhere to one another and close the commissure (i.e., stenosis). Less commonly, leaflets adhere to one another in a manner which creates stenosis as well as regurgitation, or backward blood flow. A commissurotomy is performed to separate the fused leaflets.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Closed Commissurotomy/Balloon Valvuloplasty</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Commissurotomy is usually used for mitral valve stenosis. The preferred method is percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy, which may be used for patients with congenital mitral stenosis, severe calcified mitral stenosis, left atrial thrombus, moderate to severe coexisting mitral regurgitation, or in patients with coexisting moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation who would also benefit from tricuspid valve repair (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1834">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Most often used for mitral and aortic valve stenosis, balloon valvuloplasty is less commonly used to treat tricuspid and pulmonic valve stenosis. With more widely available percutaneous valve repair and replacement procedures, balloon valvuloplasty is becoming a less common procedure in the United States (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1822">Kumar, Paniagua, Hira, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Balloon valvuloplasty may still be used for mitral valve stenosis in younger patients, and for patients with complex medical conditions that place them at high risk for complications of more extensive surgical procedures. The procedure is contraindicated for patients with left atrial or ventricular thrombus, severe aortic root dilation, significant mitral valve regurgitation, and severe valvular calcification (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1834">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Balloon valvuloplasty (<a href="#ff24-3">Fig. 24-3</a>) is performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. The patient may receive light or moderate sedation and a local anesthetic. Mitral balloon valvuloplasty involves advancing one or two catheters into the right atrium, through the atrial septum into the left atrium, across the mitral valve, and into the left ventricle. A guidewire is placed through each catheter, and the original catheter is removed. Most often a specially designed balloon catheter is placed over the guidewire and positioned with the balloon across the mitral valve. The balloon has three sections with progressively greater resistance to inflation. The balloon first expands in the ventricle to help position the catheter at the valve. The second section of the balloon expands above the valve, holding the catheter across the valve. Finally, the middle section of the balloon expands in the valve orifice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page772" title="772"></span>opening the commissures. Alternately, two balloons are used. Guidewires may be advanced into the aorta to stabilize the balloons&#x2019; positions. These single-section balloons are inflated simultaneously and expand their entire length. The advantage of two balloons is that each is smaller than the one large balloon, making smaller atrial septal defects. As the two balloons are inflated, they usually do not completely occlude the valve, thereby permitting some forward flow of blood during the inflation period. Balloons are inflated with a dilute angiographic solution for 10 to 30 seconds. Multiple inflations usually are required to achieve the desired results (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Hermann &#x0026; Mack, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">All patients will have some degree of mitral regurgitation following mitral balloon valvuloplasty. Other possible complications include bleeding from the catheter insertion sites, emboli resulting in complications such as strokes, and, rarely, left-to-right atrial shunts through the atrial septal defect created during the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Aortic balloon valvuloplasty is usually performed by introducing a catheter through the aorta, across the aortic valve, and into the left ventricle; less commonly, it may be performed by passing the balloon or balloons through the atrial septum. The one- or two-balloon technique can be used for treating aortic stenosis. Balloons are inflated for 15 to 60 seconds, and inflation is usually repeated multiple times. Possible complications include aortic regurgitation, emboli, ventricular perforation, rupture of the aortic valve annulus, ventricular arrhythmia, mitral valve damage, and bleeding from the catheter insertion sites. The aortic valve procedure is not as effective as the mitral valve procedure, and the rate of restenosis is approximately 50% in the first 6 months after the procedure. It is usually used for palliation of symptoms in patients who are not suitable candidates for TAVR, but may sometimes be used as a bridge to TAVR (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Hermann &#x0026; Mack, 2019</a>; <a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1822">Kumar et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Open Commissurotomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Since percutaneous commissurotomy has fewer risks with similar outcomes, open commissurotomy has become less commonly used in recent decades. The patient is under general anesthesia, and a midsternal or left thoracic incision is made. Cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated, and an incision is made into the heart. The valve is exposed, and a scalpel, finger, balloon, or dilator is used to open the commissures. One advantage of directly visualizing the valve and surrounding structures is that a thrombus or calcifications may be removed. Chordae or papillary muscles may also be inspected and surgically repaired as necessary.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s895">Annuloplasty</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The junction at which valve leaflets connect to the heart wall is an annulus. Annuloplasty refers to repair of the valve annulus, resulting in narrowing of the valve orifice. It is used for valvular regurgitation. For the mitral valve, there may be damage or rupture of the chordae tendineae resulting in severe mitral regurgitation, which is an indication for urgent valve repair by annuloplasty with resuspension of the chordae tendineae. General anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass are required for most annuloplasties.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two annuloplasty techniques. One technique uses an annuloplasty ring (<a href="c24-sec09.xhtml#ff24-4">Fig. 24-4</a>), which may be rigid/semirigid or flexible. Leaflets of the valve are sutured to a ring, creating an annulus of the desired size. When the ring is in place, tension created by moving blood and the contracting heart is borne by the ring rather than by the valve or a suture line, thereby preventing progressive regurgitation.</p>
<p class="indent">A second technique to tighten the annulus involves folding elongated tissue over onto itself in leaflets or tacking leaflets to the atrium or each other with sutures. Because the valve&#x2019;s leaflets and suture lines are subjected to direct forces of the blood and heart muscle movement, the repair may degenerate more quickly than one using an annuloplasty ring (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1825">Maisano, Skantharaja, Denti, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s896">Leaflet Repair</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Damage to cardiac valve leaflets may result from stretching, shortening, or tearing. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;leaflet repair:&lt;/b&gt; repair of a cardiac valve&#x2019;s movable &#x201C;flaps&#x201D; (leaflets)">Leaflet repair</button></strong> for elongated, ballooning, or other excess tissue leaflets is achieved by removing the extra tissue. Elongated tissue may be tucked and sutured, a technique called plication. A wedge of tissue may be cut from the middle of the leaflet and the gap sutured closed (i.e., leaflet resection) (<a href="c24-sec09.xhtml#ff24-5">Fig. 24-5</a>). After short chordae are released, leaflets often unfurl and resume their normal function, allowing the valve to close during systole. A leaflet may be extended by suturing a piece of pericardium to it. A pericardial or synthetic patch may be used to repair holes in the leaflets.</p>
