<h4 class="h4" id="s1904">Cancer of the Pancreas</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. It is very rare before the age of 45 years, and the majority of patients present in or beyond the sixth decade of life (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). The incidence of pancreatic cancer increases with age, peaking in the seventh and eighth decades for both men and women (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3352">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2020</a>). The frequency of pancreatic cancer has decreased slightly over the past 25 years among non-Caucasian men. There is a slight male preponderance; and in the United States, incidence is highest in African American males (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>). Exposure to industrial chemicals or toxins in the environment, and a diet high in fat, meat, or both are associated risk factors (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The risk of pancreatic cancer is greater in those with a history of increased pack years of cigarette smoking and in those with high alcohol intake. Diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hereditary pancreatitis, and obesity are also associated with pancreatic cancer (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Rawla, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). The pancreas can also be the site of metastasis from other tumors.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1438</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1439" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1439">p. 1439</span></div>
<p class="indent">Cancer may develop in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas; clinical manifestations vary depending on the site and whether functioning insulin-secreting pancreatic islet cells are involved. Approximately 70% of pancreatic cancers originate in the head of the pancreas and give rise to a distinctive clinical picture (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Rawla, 2019</a>). Functioning islet cell tumors, whether benign (adenoma) or malignant (adenocarcinoma), are responsible for the syndrome of hyperinsulinism. The symptoms are typically nonspecific, and patients usually do not seek medical attention until late in the disease. Only about 7% of cases are diagnosed in early stages; 80% to 85% of patients have advanced, unresectable tumor when first detected. As a result, pancreatic carcinoma has only a 7% survival rate at 5 years regardless of the stage of disease at diagnosis or treatment (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Rawla, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1905">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain, jaundice, or both are present in more than 80% of patients and, along with weight loss, are considered classic signs of pancreatic carcinoma (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>). However, they often do not appear until the disease is far advanced. Other signs include rapid, profound, and progressive weight loss as well as vague upper or midabdominal pain or discomfort that is unrelated to any GI function and is often difficult to describe. Such discomfort radiates as a boring pain in the midback and is unrelated to posture or activity. It is often progressive and severe, requiring the use of opioids. It is often more severe at night and is accentuated when lying supine. Relief may be obtained by sitting up and leaning forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Malignant cells from pancreatic cancer are often shed into the peritoneal cavity, increasing the likelihood of metastasis. The formation of ascites is common. An important sign, if present, is the onset of symptoms of insulin deficiency: glucosuria, hyperglycemia, and abnormal glucose tolerance. Therefore, diabetes may be an early sign of carcinoma of the pancreas. Meals often aggravate epigastric pain, which usually occurs before the appearance of jaundice and pruritus.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1906">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Spiral (helical) CT is more than 85% to 90% accurate in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer and currently is the most useful preoperative imaging technique. MRI/MRCP may also be used. EUS is useful in identifying small tumors and in performing fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the primary tumor or lymph nodes (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>). EUS can be superior to CT in localizing these small tumors, which can produce dramatic symptoms despite their size (&#x003C;1 cm) (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>). ERCP may also be used in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.</p>
<p class="indent">Cells obtained during ERCP are sent to the laboratory for analysis. GI x-ray findings may demonstrate deformities in adjacent organs caused by the impinging pancreatic mass.</p>
<p class="indent">A histologic diagnosis is not usually required in patients who are candidates for surgery. The tissue diagnosis is made at the time of the surgical procedure. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas, which is used to diagnose pancreatic tumors, is also used to confirm the diagnosis in patients whose tumors are not resectable so that a palliative plan of care can be determined. This may eliminate the stress and postoperative pain of ineffective surgery. In this procedure, a needle is inserted through the anterior abdominal wall into the pancreatic mass, guided by CT, ultrasound, ERCP, or other imaging techniques. The aspirated material is examined for malignant cells. Although percutaneous biopsy is a valuable diagnostic tool, it has some potential drawbacks: a false-negative result if small tumors are missed and the risk of seeding of cancer cells along the needle track. Low-dose radiation to the site may be used before the biopsy to reduce this risk.</p>
<p class="indent">PTC is another procedure that may be performed to identify obstructions of the biliary tract by a pancreatic tumor. Several tumor markers (e.g., cancer antigen 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, DU-PAN-2) may be used in the diagnostic workup, but they are nonspecific for pancreatic carcinoma. These tumor markers are useful as indicators of disease progression.</p>
<p class="indent">Angiography, CT scans, and laparoscopy may be performed to determine whether the tumor can be removed surgically. Intraoperative ultrasonography has been used to determine whether there is metastatic disease to other organs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1907">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the tumor is resectable and localized (typically tumors in the head of the pancreas), the surgical procedure to remove it is usually extensive (see later discussion). However, total excision of the lesion often is not possible for two reasons: (1) extensive growth of tumor before diagnosis, and (2) probable widespread metastases (especially to the liver, lungs, and bones). More often, treatment is limited to palliative measures.</p>
<p class="indent">Although pancreatic tumors may be resistant to standard radiation therapy, the patient may be treated with radiation and chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and gemcitabine). Currently, gemcitabine is the standard of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and has been found to lengthen survival (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>). The targeted anticancer drug erlotinib has demonstrated a slight improvement in advanced pancreatic cancer survival when used in combination with gemcitabine (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>). Agents such as S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine), or the use of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel with gemcitabine therapy, combined with radiation or surgery may also result in improved survival (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3363">Kamisawa, Wood, Itoi, et al., 2016</a>). Irinotecan, in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, was approved as treatment for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that has progressed following treatment with a gemcitabine-based therapy. 5-Fluorouracil or capecitabine, a similar but orally administered drug, are used as radiosensitizers during radiation therapy (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>). Single-agent gemcitabine may be used in patients who are not well enough to tolerate combination therapy (ACS, 2020; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3370">O&#x2019;Reilly, Fou, Hasler, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient undergoes surgery, intraoperative radiation therapy may be used to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor with minimal injury to other tissues; this may also be helpful in relief of pain. Interstitial implantation of radioactive sources has also been used, although the rate of complications is high. A large biliary stent inserted percutaneously <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1440" title="1440"></span>or by endoscopy may be used to relieve jaundice (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3370">O&#x2019;Reilly et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1908">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain management and attention to nutritional requirements are important nursing measures that improve the level of patient comfort. Skin care and nursing measures are directed toward relief of pain and discomfort associated with jaundice, anorexia, and profound weight loss. Specialty mattresses are beneficial and protect bony prominences from pressure. Pain associated with pancreatic cancer may be severe and may require liberal use of opioids; patient-controlled analgesia should be considered for the patient with severe, escalating pain.</p>
<p class="indent">There is growing evidence that symptoms frequently appear together in a phenomenon known as a symptom cluster. A symptom cluster is two (or more) symptoms occurring at the same time. The symptoms included in a cluster may have shared underlying mechanisms or outcomes, and pancreatic cancer is one of the diseases that appears to have associated symptom clusters. It may be beneficial to investigate these symptoms as a cluster, rather than individually (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3367">Miaskowski, Barsevick, Berger, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Symptom clusters associated with pancreatic cancer have been identified in several studies and include affective, GI, gustatory, and discomfort-related symptoms (Burrell, Yeo, Smeltzer, et al., 2018a, 2018b). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c44-sec11.xhtml#ct44-5">Chart 44-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowledge and awareness regarding symptom clusters is important to nursing care for patients with pancreatic cancer. Improving nursing assessments and interventions based upon this evidence may improve the quality of life and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgical resection for this disease (Burrell et al., 2018a, 2018b). Because of the poor prognosis and likelihood of short survival, end-of-life preferences are discussed and honored. If appropriate, the nurse refers the patient to hospice care. See Chapters 12 and 13 for care of the patient with cancer and end-of-life care, respectively.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Specific education for the patient and family varies with the stage of disease and the treatment choices made by the patient. If the patient elects to receive chemotherapy, the nurse focuses on prevention of side effects and complications of the agents used. If surgery is performed to relieve obstruction and establish biliary drainage, education addresses management of the drainage system and monitoring for complications. The nurse educates the family about changes in the patient&#x2019;s status that should be reported to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A referral for home, community-based, or transitional care is indicated to help the patient and family deal with the physical problems and discomforts associated with pancreatic cancer and the psychological impact of the disease. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical status, fluid and nutritional status, skin integrity, and the adequacy of pain management. The nurse educates the patient and family on strategies to prevent skin breakdown and relieve pain, pruritus, and anorexia. It is important to discuss and arrange palliative care (hospice services) as indicated in an effort to relieve patient discomfort, assist with care, and comply with the patient&#x2019;s end-of-life decisions and wishes.</p>
