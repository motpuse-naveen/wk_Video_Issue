<h4 class="h4" id="s2537">Testicular Cancer</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Although only accounting for about 1% of all cancers in men, testicular cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men between 15 and 35 years of age; approximately 9610 new cases and 440 deaths occur in the United States annually (ACS, 2020). It is the second most common malignancy in those 35 to 39 years of age. For unknown reasons, worldwide incidence of testicular tumors has more than doubled in the past 40 years. Because of advances in cancer therapy, testicular cancer is a highly treatable and usually curable form of cancer. The 5-year relative survival rate for all testicular cancers is more than 95% and approaches 99% if the cancer has not spread outside of the testes (ACS, 2020). After treatment, most patients with testicular cancer have a near-normal life expectancy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2538">Classification of Testicular Tumors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The testicles contain several types of cells, each of which may develop into one or more types of cancer. The type of cancer cell determines the appropriate treatment and affects the prognosis. Testicular cancer is classified as germinal or nongerminal (stromal). Secondary testicular cancers may also occur.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Germinal Tumors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Germinal tumors make up approximately 90% of all cancers of the testis; germinal tumors are further classified as seminomas or nonseminomas. These cancers grow from the germ cells that produce sperm, thus the name <em>germinal tumors.</em> Seminomas are slow-growing forms of testicular cancer that are usually found in men in their 30s and 40s (ACS, 2020; NCCN, 2020c). Although seminomas can spread to the lymph nodes, the cancer is usually localized in the testes. Nonseminomas are more common and tend to grow more quickly than seminomas. Nonseminomas are often made up of different cell types and are identified according to the cells in which they start to grow. Nonseminoma testicular cancers include choriocarcinomas (rare), embryonal carcinomas, teratomas, and yolk sac tumors. It is crucial to distinguish between seminomas and nonseminomas because the differences affect prognosis and treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nongerminal Tumors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nongerminal tumors account for less than 10% of testicular cancers. These cancers may develop in the supportive and hormone-producing tissues, or stroma, of the testicles. The two main types of stromal tumors are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors. Although these tumors infrequently spread beyond the testicle, a small number metastasize and tend to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Secondary Testicular Tumors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Secondary testicular tumors are those that have metastasized to the testicle from other organs. Lymphoma is the most common cause of secondary testicular cancer. Cancers may also spread to the testicles from the prostate gland, lung, skin (melanoma), kidney, and other organs. The prognosis with these cancers is usually poor because they typically also spread to other organs. Treatment depends on the specific type of cancer (ACS, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2539">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Risk factors for testicular cancer include cryptorchidism (undescended testicles), family history of testicular cancer, and personal history of testicular cancer (ACS, 2020). Other risk factors include race and ethnicity: Caucasian American men have a five times greater risk than African American men and more than two to three times greater risk than Asian, Native American, and Hispanic American men. The risk of developing testicular cancer is higher in HIV-positive men (ACS, 2020). Occupational hazards, including exposure to chemicals encountered in mining, oil and gas production, and leather processing, have been suggested as possible risk factors. No evidence has linked testicular cancer to prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol or to vasectomy (ACS, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2540">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The symptoms appear gradually, with a mass or lump on the testicle and usually painless enlargement of the testis. The patient may report heaviness in the scrotum, inguinal area, or lower abdomen. Backache (from retroperitoneal node extension), abdominal pain, weight loss, and general weakness may result from metastasis. Enlargement of the testis without pain is a significant diagnostic finding. Some testicular tumors tend to metastasize early, spreading from the testis to the lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and to the lungs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2541">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Educating young men about testicular cancer and the need for urgent evaluation of any mass or enlargement or unexplained testicular pain is key to early detection (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3866">Li, Lu, Wang, et al., 2020</a>). Education about TSE, starting in adolescence, alerts men to the importance of seeking medical attention if a testicle becomes indurated, enlarged, atrophied, nodular, or painful (see <a href="#ct53-6">Chart&#x00A0;53-6</a>). TSE should be performed monthly. Testicular cancers generally grow rapidly and are easily detected against a typically smooth and homogeneous texture. Annual testicular examination by a clinician can reveal signs and lead to early diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer. Promoting awareness of this disease is an important health promotion intervention; men should seek medical evaluation for signs or symptoms of testicular cancer without delay (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Li et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3889">Ustundag, 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct53-7">Chart&#x00A0;53-7</a>. Any suspicious testicular mass warrants prompt evaluation with a thorough history and physical examination, focusing on palpation of the affected testicle.</p>
<p class="indent">The tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), may be elevated in patients with testicular cancer. Tumor marker levels in the blood are used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring the response to treatment. Blood chemistry, including lactate dehydrogenase, is also necessary.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong><strong>Testicular Self-Examination</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Testicular self-examination is to be performed once a month. The test is neither difficult nor time-consuming. A convenient time is usually after a warm bath or shower when the scrotum is more relaxed.</p>

<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>Use both hands to palpate the testis. The normal testicle is smooth and uniform in consistency.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>Place the index and middle fingers under the testis and the thumb on top; roll the testis gently in a horizontal plane between the thumb and fingers (<strong>A</strong>).</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>Feel for any evidence of a small lump or abnormality.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>4.</strong></span>Follow the same procedure and palpate upward along the testis (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B</button></strong>).</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>5.</strong></span>Locate and palpate the epididymis (<strong>C</strong>), a cordlike structure on the top and back of the testicle that stores and transports sperm. In addition, locate and palpate the spermatic cord.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>6.</strong></span>Repeat the examination for the other testis, epididymis, and spermatic cord. It is normal to find that one testis is larger than the other.</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Last"><span class="numah"><strong>7.</strong></span>If you find any evidence of a small, pea-sized lump or if the testis is swollen (possibly from an infection or tumor), consult your primary provider.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Ustundag, H. (2019). Assessment of the testicular self-examination knowledge and Health Belief Model of health sciences students. <em>International Journal of Caring Sciences</em>, <em>12</em>(2), 972&#x2013;978.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Early detection of testicular cancer is possible if men perform monthly testicular self-examinations. However, many men are not aware of the benefits of doing a testicular self-examination. The purpose of this study was to describe young male health sciences students&#x2019; knowledge of testicular cancer and practice of testicular self-examination, along with their personal health beliefs.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This descriptive survey research study was conducted in a state university in Turkey. There were 372 male students who were given the opportunity to participate, and 262 students (70%) completed the demographic data form and the Turkish version of the Champion Health Belief Model Scale. This scale contains five sub scales: (1) Sensitiveness, an individual&#x2019;s perception of personal risks or sensitivities to a disease or health problem; (2) Caring/Seriousness, an individual&#x2019;s view of the seriousness of the disease outcomes; (3) Benefits, an individual&#x2019;s belief in the benefit of protective behavior to prevent the disease from occurring or decrease the severity of symptoms if it occurs; (4) Perceived barriers to instituting new behaviors and adapting to new situations; and (5) Self-efficacy/Confidence, an individual&#x2019;s belief in the ability to take on the new initiative. Each subscale has its own minimum and maximum scores, and a separate score is determined for each of the five subscales. There is no total calculated score. The statistical analysis was performed using basic descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, mean scores, and the nonparametric tests, the Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test and Mann&#x2013;Whitney U test.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study participants were 18 to 27 years of age, with approximately 60% of participants in the 18- to 21-year-old age range. Most of the participants (40%, <em>n</em> = 104) were in their second year of education at the university. All the participants indicated that they had knowledge about testicular cancer, with 42% (<em>n</em> = 109) revealing that their knowledge was obtained from the internet or from social media. There were 7% of the sample (<em>n</em> = 18) who acknowledged that they had had a testicular health problem. In their family histories, 93% (<em>n</em> = 244) of the participants stated that there was no history of testicular health problems. There were 225 of the participants (86%) who had no experience doing a self-examination. The most common reason for not performing a testicular self-examination was that 74% (<em>n</em> = 195) did not take the reason for doing the self-examination seriously. The Champion Health Beliefs Model Scale identified that the caring/seriousness subscale had the highest score and that the perceived benefits of performing a testicular self-examination had the lowest score.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study confirmed that young males lack knowledge about testicular cancer and lack experience performing a testicular self-examination. It is important for nurses and other health care providers to address the patient&#x2019;s need for knowledge and practical education on the performance of testicular self-examination. Emphasis must be placed on the fact that testicular self-examination is a significant risk reduction strategy for testicular cancer. The screening for testicular cancer is a topic that not only must be addressed by health care providers, but also included in the curriculum of health science and other educational programs. Frequent discussion and materials about testicular screening must be made available to all males.</p>

<p class="indent">A chest x-ray to assess for metastasis in the lungs and a transscrotal testicular ultrasound will be performed. Microscopic analysis of tissue is the only definitive way to determine if cancer is present, but it is usually performed at the time of surgery rather than as a part of the diagnostic workup to reduce the risk of promoting spread of the cancer (ACS, 2020). Inguinal orchiectomy is the standard way to establish the diagnosis of testicular cancer. Other staging tests to determine the extent of the disease in the retroperitoneum, pelvis, and chest include an abdominal/pelvic CT scan and chest CT scan (if the abdominal CT or chest x-ray is abnormal). A brain MRI and bone scan may be obtained if indicated (NCCN, 2020c). Discussion of the option to bank sperm should take place prior to orchiectomy and treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2542">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Testicular cancer&#x2014;one of the most curable solid tumors&#x2014;is highly responsive to treatment. Early-stage disease is curable more than 95% of the time; thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. The NCCN practice consensus guidelines for testicular cancer are used to guide diagnostic workup, primary treatment, follow-up, and salvage therapy (treatment given when the cancer does not respond to standard treatment) for both seminomas and nonseminomas (NCCN, 2020c). The goals of management are to eradicate the disease and achieve a cure. Therapy is based on the cell type, the stage of the disease, and risk classification tables (determined as good, intermediate, and poor risk). Primary treatment includes removal of the affected testis by orchiectomy through an inguinal incision with a high ligation of the spermatic cord. The patient is offered the option of implantation of a testicular prosthesis during the orchiectomy. Although most patients experience no impairment of endocrine function after unilateral orchiectomy for testicular cancer, some patients have decreased hormonal levels, suggesting that the unaffected testis is not functioning normally. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may be performed after orchiectomy to diagnose and prevent lymphatic spread of the cancer. Alternatives to the more invasive open retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early-stage germ cell testicular cancer include nerve-sparing and laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, which improve sexual function and promote rapid recovery (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3869">Mano, Di Natale, &#x0026; Sheinfeld, 2019</a>). Although libido and orgasm are usually unimpaired after a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, ejaculatory dysfunction with resultant infertility may develop. Two thirds of men who are newly diagnosed with testicular cancer may be considering future fatherhood, and sperm quality is reduced in men with testicular cancer; therefore, sperm banking before treatment may be considered (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Mano et al., 2019</a>). Half of patients will not recover fertility as a result of radiation therapy, cytotoxic therapy, unilateral excision of a testis, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Counseling about fertility issues may help the patient make the appropriate choices (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Halpern, Brannigan, &#x0026; Schlegel, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Radiation therapy is more effective with seminomas than with nonseminomas. Postoperatively, radiation may be used in early-stage seminomas. It is delivered only to the affected side; the other testis is shielded from radiation to preserve fertility. Radiation is also used in patients whose disease does not respond to chemotherapy and in those for whom lymph node surgery is not recommended.</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapy may be used for seminomas, nonseminomas, and advanced metastatic disease. Cisplatin can be used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as etoposide, bleomycin, paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and vinblastine, and results in a high percentage of complete remissions. With nonseminomas, aggressive surgical resection of all residual masses following chemotherapy is standard therapy. Good results may also be obtained by combining different types of treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Even with metastatic testicular cancer, the prognosis is favorable because of advances in treatment. However, for patients who do not respond to high-dose salvage chemotherapy, the cancer is nearly always incurable.</p>
<p class="indent">A patient with a history of one testicular tumor has a greater chance of developing subsequent tumors. Late relapse of testicular cancer is currently defined as tumor recurrence more than 2 years after complete remission following primary treatment that included chemotherapy. The most common site of recurrence is the retroperitoneum. Follow-up studies include chest x-rays, excretory urography, radioimmunoassay of beta-hCG and AFP levels, and examination of lymph nodes.</p>
<p class="indent">Long-term side effects associated with treatment for testicular cancer include renal insufficiency from kidney damage, hearing problems, gonadal damage, peripheral neuropathy, and, rarely, secondary cancers. Management of a patient with testicular carcinoma is therapy aimed at cure followed by close monitoring to detect and promptly treat any recurrences (NCCN, 2020c). Investigations of new medications, combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, and stem cell transplantation are ongoing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2543">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management includes assessment of the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status and monitoring of the patient for response to and possible effects of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Pre- and postoperative care is described in <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;14</a> and <a href="c16.xhtml">16</a>, respectively. In addition, because the patient may have difficulty coping with his condition, issues related to body image and sexuality should be addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may be required to endure a long course of therapy and will need encouragement to maintain a positive attitude. After completing treatment, patients enter a follow-up surveillance period. Nurses educate these cancer survivors about the importance of adhering to follow-up appointments for early detection of cancer recurrence (most often occurring within 2 years posttreatment) and evaluation of late effects of treatment (including secondary cancers). Additional concerns include infertility, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and metabolic syndrome; and alterations in quality of life (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>). The nurse carefully assesses cultural aspects of care related to testicular cancer and its treatment. The nurse reminds the patient about the importance of performing TSE in the treated or remaining testis. The patient is encouraged to participate in healthy behaviors, including smoking cessation, healthy diet, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1774" title="1774"></span>minimization of alcohol intake, and cancer screening activities. Most experts agree that couples should use birth control for 18 to 24 months after the last cycle of chemotherapy as this is the usual period of time after treatment for sperm to return to normal (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>).</p>
