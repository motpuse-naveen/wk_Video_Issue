<h4 class="h4" id="s1292">Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An allergic reaction is a manifestation of tissue injury resulting from interaction between an antigen and an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;antibody:&lt;/b&gt; a protein substance developed by the body in response to and interacting with a specific antigen">antibody</button></strong> (a protein substance developed by B cells in response to and interacting with a specific antigen) (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;allergy:&lt;/b&gt; inappropriate and often harmful immune system response to substances that are normally harmless">Allergy</button></strong> is an inappropriate and often harmful response of the immune system to normally harmless substances, called <strong>allergens</strong> (e.g., dust, weeds, pollen, dander). Chemical mediators released in allergic reactions may produce symptoms that range from mild to life-threatening.</p>
<p class="indent">In allergic reactions, the body encounters allergens that are types of antigens, usually proteins that the body&#x2019;s defenses recognize as foreign, and a series of events occurs in an attempt to render the invaders harmless, destroy them, and remove them from the body. There is a generalized white blood cell response to the entrance of antigens into the body. Specific types of white blood cells, called B lymphocytes (also called B cells), are specifically triggered by the presence of antigen. B lymphocytes differentiate into <strong>plasma cell</strong><strong>s</strong>, which then secrete antibodies that attack the antigen.</p>
<p class="indent">Specific antibodies develop in response to specific antigens. Antibodies combine with antigens in a special way, which has been likened to a lock and key. Antigens (the keys) fit only certain antibodies (the locks). Hence, the term <em>specificity</em> refers to the specific reaction of an antibody to an antigen. There are many variations and complexities in these patterns. In addition, antibodies have memory for the specific antigen, so that upon future exposure, the lock and key reaction occurs again (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1293">Function of Immunoglobulins</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Antibodies that are formed by plasma cells in response to an immunogenic stimulus constitute a group of serum proteins called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;immunoglobulins:&lt;/b&gt; a family of closely related proteins capable of acting as antibodies">immunoglobulins</button></strong>. Grouped into five classes (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE), immunoglobulins can be found in the lymph nodes, tonsils, appendix, and Peyer patches of the intestinal tract or circulating in the blood and lymph. These antibodies are capable of binding with a wide variety of antigens. Immunoglobulins of the IgE class are involved in allergic disorders and some parasitic infections. IgE-producing cells are located in the respiratory and intestinal mucosa. Two or more IgE molecules bind together to an allergen and trigger <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mast cells:&lt;/b&gt; connective tissue cells that contain heparin and histamine in their granules">mast cells</button></strong> or basophils to release chemical mediators, such as histamine, serotonin, kinins, slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis, and the neutrophil factor, which produces allergic skin reactions, asthma, and hay fever. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;atopy:&lt;/b&gt; term often used to describe immunoglobulin E&#x2013;mediated diseases (i.e., atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis) with a genetic component">Atopy</button></strong> refers to IgE-mediated diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, that have a genetic component (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>). See <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> for more information on immunoglobulins.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Role of B Cells</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B cells</button></strong>, or B lymphocytes, are programmed to produce one specific antibody. On encountering a specific antigen, B cells generate plasma cells, at the site of antibody production. The plasma cells secrete antibodies for the purpose of destroying and removing the antigens. B cells participate in humoral immunity (also called antibody-mediated immunity), which is one kind of adaptive immunity (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Role of T Cells</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are different types of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;T cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a cellular immune response">T cells</button></strong>, or T lymphocytes, that participate in cellular immunity (also called cell-mediated immunity), a type of adaptive immunity. T helper cells are specific types of T lymphocytes that assist B cells in the immune response. T cells secrete substances that direct the flow of cell activity and stimulate macrophages. Macrophages present the antigens to the T cells and initiate the immune response. They also digest antigens and assist in removing cells and other debris (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1294">Function of Antigens</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Antigens are divided into two groups: complete protein antigens and low-molecular-weight substances. Complete protein antigens, such as animal dander, pollen, and horse serum, stimulate a complete humoral response. A humoral response is another name for a B lymphocyte&#x2013;mediated response. See <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> for a discussion of humoral immunity. Low-molecular-weight substances, such as medications, function as <strong>haptens</strong> (incomplete antigens), binding to tissue or serum proteins to produce a carrier complex that initiates an antibody response. In an allergic reaction, the production of antibodies requires active communication between cells. When the allergen is absorbed through the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or skin, allergen sensitization occurs. In the humoral response, B cells mature into allergen-specific secreting plasma cells that synthesize and secrete antigen-specific antibodies (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

Immunoglobulins stimulate mast cells to release histamine and other inflammatory mediators.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1295">Function of Chemical Mediators</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mast cells, which are located in the skin, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract, play a major role in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. When mast cells are stimulated by antigens, powerful chemical mediators, such as histamine, are released, causing a sequence of physiologic events that result in symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity (see <a href="#ff33-1">Fig. 33-1</a>). There are two types of chemical mediators: primary and secondary. Primary mediators are preformed and are found in mast cells or basophils. Secondary mediators are inactive precursors that are formed or released in response to primary mediators. <a href="#tt33-1">Table 33-1</a> summarizes the actions of primary and secondary chemical mediators (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Primary Mediators</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, platelet-activating factor, and prostaglandins are primary chemical mediators in allergic responses.</p>
<p class="h7">Histamine</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;histamine:&lt;/b&gt; substance in the body that causes increased gastric secretion, dilation of capillaries, and constriction of the bronchial smooth muscle">Histamine</button></strong>, which is released by mast cells, plays an important role in the immune response. It is the first chemical mediator to be released in immune and inflammatory responses. It is synthesized and stored in high concentrations in body tissues exposed to environmental substances. Histamine&#x2019;s effects peak 5 to 10 minutes after antigen contact and include the following: erythema; localized edema in the form of wheals; pruritus; contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in wheezing and bronchospasm; dilation of small venules and constriction of larger vessels; and increased secretion of gastric and mucosal cells, resulting in diarrhea. Histamine action results from stimulation of histamine-1 (H<sub>1</sub>) and histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) receptors. H<sub>1</sub> receptors are found predominantly on bronchiolar and vascular smooth muscle cells; H<sub>2</sub> receptors are found on gastric parietal cells (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Certain medications are categorized by their action at these receptors. Diphenhydramine is an example of an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;antihistamine:&lt;/b&gt; medication that opposes the action of histamine">antihistamine</button></strong>, a medication that displays an affinity for H<sub>1</sub> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1041" title="1041"></span>receptors. Cimetidine targets H<sub>2</sub> receptors to inhibit gastric secretions in peptic ulcer disease.</p>

<p class="h7">Eosinophil Chemotactic Factor of Anaphylaxis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis affects the movement of <strong>eosinophils</strong> (granular leukocytes) to the site of allergens. It is preformed in the mast cells and is released from disrupted mast cells.</p>
<p class="h7">Platelet-Activating Factor</p>
<p class="nonindent">Platelet-activating factor is responsible for initiating platelet aggregation and leukocyte infiltration at sites of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. It also causes vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and increased vascular permeability (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Prostaglandins</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prostaglandins:&lt;/b&gt; unsaturated fatty acids that have a wide assortment of biologic activity">Prostaglandins</button></strong> produce smooth muscle contraction as well as vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. They sensitize pain receptors and increase the pain associated with inflammation. In addition, prostaglandins induce inflammation and enhance the effects of mediators of inflammatory response. Local manifestations include erythema, heat, and edema (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Secondary Mediators</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Leukotrines, bradykinin, and serotonin are all secondary chemical mediators.</p>
<p class="h7">Leukotrienes</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;leukotrienes:&lt;/b&gt; a group of chemical mediators that initiate the inflammatory response">Leukotrienes</button></strong> are chemical mediators that initiate the inflammatory response. Many manifestations of inflammation can be attributed in part to leukotrienes. In addition, leukotrienes cause smooth muscle contraction, bronchial constriction, mucus secretion in the airways, and the typical wheal-and-flare reactions of the skin. Compared with histamine, leukotrienes are 100 to 1000 times more potent in causing bronchospasm (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Castells, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Bradykinin</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bradykinin:&lt;/b&gt; a substance that stimulates nerve fibers and causes pain">Bradykinin</button></strong> is a substance that has the ability to cause increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, hypotension, and contraction of many types of smooth muscle, such as the bronchi. Increased permeability of the capillaries results in edema. Bradykinin stimulates nerve cell fibers and produces pain.</p>
<p class="h7">Serotonin</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;serotonin:&lt;/b&gt; chemical mediator that acts as a potent vasoconstrictor and bronchoconstrictor">Serotonin</button></strong> is a chemical mediator that acts as a potent vasoconstrictor and causes contraction of bronchial smooth muscle.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1296">Hypersensitivity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although the immune system defends the host against infections and foreign antigens, immune responses can themselves cause tissue injury and disease. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypersensitivity:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal heightened reaction to a stimulus of any kind">Hypersensitivity</button></strong> is an excessive or aberrant immune response to any type of stimulus (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>). It usually does not occur with the first exposure to an allergen. Rather, the reaction follows a re-exposure after sensitization, or buildup of antibodies, in a predisposed person. Injurious or pathologic immune reactions are classed as hypersensitivity reactions. To promote understanding of the immunopathogenesis of disease, hypersensitivity reactions have been classified into four specific types of reactions (see <a href="#ff33-2">Fig. 33-2</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Anaphylactic (Type I) Hypersensitivity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most severe hypersensitivity reaction is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anaphylaxis:&lt;/b&gt; rapid clinical response to an immediate immunologic reaction between a specific antigen and antibody">anaphylaxis</button></strong>. An unanticipated severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset, anaphylaxis is characterized by edema in many tissues, including the larynx, and is often accompanied by hypotension, bronchospasm, and cardiovascular collapse in severe cases. Anaphylaxis is a severe type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is an immediate reaction beginning within minutes of exposure to an antigen. Primary chemical mediators are responsible for the symptoms of type I hypersensitivity because of their effects on the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. If chemical mediators continue to be released, a delayed reaction may occur and may last for up to 24 hours (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2425">Marshall et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical symptoms are determined by the amount of the allergen, the amount of mediator released, the sensitivity of the target organ, and the route of allergen entry. Type I hypersensitivity reactions may include both local and systemic anaphylaxis (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cytotoxic (Type II) Hypersensitivity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Type II, or cytotoxic hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies are directed against antigens on cells or basement membranes of tissues. This reaction can lead to cell lysis and tissue damage. Type II hypersensitivity reactions are associated with several disorders. The best example is a hemolytic transfusion reaction. For example, if a person with type A blood is mistakenly given type B blood, anti-B antibodies are triggered in the recipient that attack the infused type B blood cells and cause hemolysis (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Immune Complex (Type III) Hypersensitivity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Type III, or immune complex hypersensitivity, is a damaging inflammatory reaction caused by the insoluble immune complexes formed by antigens that bind to antibodies. These complexes are too large to be cleared from the circulation by phagocytic action. The immune complexes are deposited in tissues or vascular endothelium and trigger inflammation at different sites throughout the body. An example of this kind of hypersensitivity reaction occurs in rheumatoid arthritis. An unknown antigen triggers antibody formation, which then forms immune complexes that are deposited in the joints. Many autoimmune disorders are type III hypersensitivity reactions. In autoimmune reactions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, patients form autoantibodies that form immune complexes that deposit in the lungs, skin, and kidney (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Type IV, or delayed hypersensitivity, is a T cell&#x2013;mediated immune reaction after exposure to an antigen. This immune reaction typically occurs 24 to 48 hours after exposure to an antigen. The prototypical type IV hypersensitivity reaction occurs in response to the subcutaneous injection of purified protein derivative (PPD) antigen from <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</em> Patients who have had previous exposure or have tuberculosis (TB) infection will demonstrate a reaction of erythema and induration due to sensitized T cells (<a href="c33-sec13.xhtml#bib2462">Actor, 2019</a>).</p>
