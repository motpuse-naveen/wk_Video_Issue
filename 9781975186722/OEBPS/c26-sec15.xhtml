<h4 class="h4" id="s1024">Chronic Venous Insufficiency/Postthrombotic Syndrome</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Venous insufficiency results from obstruction of the venous valves in the legs or a reflux of blood through the valves. Superficial and deep leg veins can be involved. Resultant venous hypertension can occur whenever there has been a prolonged increase in venous pressure, such as occurs with DVT. Because the walls of veins are thinner and more elastic than the walls of arteries, they distend readily when venous pressure is consistently elevated. In this state, leaflets of the venous valves are stretched and prevented from closing completely, causing a backflow or reflux of blood in the veins. Duplex ultrasonography confirms the obstruction and identifies the level of valvular incompetence. Twenty percent to 50% of patients who have had a DVT develop deep vein incompetence leading to postthrombotic syndrome (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#ff26-15">Fig. 26-15</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1025">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postthrombotic syndrome is characterized by chronic venous stasis, resulting in edema, altered pigmentation, pain, and stasis dermatitis. The patient may notice the symptoms less in the morning and more in the evening. Obstruction or poor calf muscle pumping in addition to valvular reflux must be present for the development of severe postthrombotic syndrome and stasis ulcers. Superficial veins may be dilated. The disorder is long-standing, difficult to treat, and often disabling (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1941">Kahn, Galanaud, Vedantham, et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Stasis ulcers develop as a result of the rupture of small skin veins and subsequent ulcerations. When these vessels rupture, red blood cells escape into surrounding tissues and then degenerate, leaving a brownish discoloration of the tissues, called <em>hemosiderin staining.</em> The pigmentation and ulcerations usually occur in the lower part of the extremity, in the area of the medial malleolus of the ankle. The skin becomes dry, cracks, and itches; subcutaneous tissues fibrose and atrophy. The risk of injury and infection of the extremities is increased.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1026">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Venous ulceration is the most serious complication of chronic venous insufficiency and can be associated with other conditions affecting the circulation of the lower extremities. Cellulitis or dermatitis may complicate the care of chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcerations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1027">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of the patient with venous insufficiency is directed at reducing venous stasis and preventing ulcerations. Extremities with venous insufficiency must be carefully protected from trauma; the skin is kept clean, dry, and soft. Signs of ulceration are immediately reported to the primary provider for treatment and follow-up. Measures that increase venous blood flow are antigravity activities, such as elevating the leg, and compression of superficial veins with graduated compression stockings and other compression therapies.</p>
<p class="indent">Elevating the legs decreases edema, promotes venous return, and provides symptomatic relief. The legs should be elevated frequently throughout the day (at least 15 to 20 minutes four times daily). At night, the patient should sleep with the foot of the bed elevated about 15 cm (6 inches). Prolonged sitting or standing in one position is detrimental; walking should be encouraged. When sitting, the patient should avoid placing pressure on the popliteal spaces, as occurs when crossing the legs or sitting with the legs dangling over the side of the bed. Constricting garments, especially socks that are tight at the top or that leave marks on the skin, should be avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">Compression of the legs with graduated compression stockings reduces the pooling of venous blood, enhances venous return to the heart, and is recommended for people with venous insufficiency.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Compression Therapy</h6>
<p class="h7a">Stockings</p>
<p class="nonindent">Graduated compression stockings usually are prescribed for patients with venous disease as soon as possible after diagnosis (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Bjork &#x0026; Ehmann, 2019</a>). The amount of pressure gradient is determined by the amount and severity of venous disease. For example, a pressure gradient of 20 to 30 mm Hg is prescribed for patients with asymptomatic varicose veins, whereas at least a pressure gradient of 30 to 40 mm Hg at the ankle is recommended for patients with venous stasis ulceration (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Bjork &#x0026; Ehmann, 2019</a>). Compression stockings with at least 30 to 40 mm Hg pressure can be used during the 6 months post DVT to decrease symptoms and reduce the development of postthrombotic syndrome (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Zierler &#x0026; Dawson, 2016</a>). These stockings should not be confused with anti-embolism stockings (i.e., thromboembolic deterrent [TED] stockings) that provide less compression (12 to 20 mm Hg at the ankle). Graduated compression stockings are designed to apply 100% of the prescribed pressure gradient at the ankle and then decrease along the length of the stocking, reducing the caliber of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page854" title="854"></span>superficial veins in the leg and increasing flow in the deep veins. Each stocking should fit so that pressure is greater at the foot and ankle and then gradually declines to a lesser pressure at the knee or groin. These stockings may be knee high, thigh high, or pantyhose. Several colors, fabrics, and styles are available to promote patient adherence. Stockings should be applied after the legs have been elevated for a period, when the amount of blood in the leg veins is at its lowest.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Any type of stocking can inadvertently become a tourniquet if applied incorrectly (i.e., rolled tightly at the top). In such instances, the stockings produce&#x2014;rather than prevent&#x2014;venous stasis. For ambulatory patients, graduated compression stockings can be removed at night and reapplied before the legs are lowered from the bed to the floor in the morning.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">When the stockings are off, the skin is inspected for signs of irritation, and the calves are examined for tenderness. Any skin changes or signs of tenderness are reported. Stockings are contraindicated in patients with severe PAD, epifascial arterial bypass, severe cardiac insufficiency, allergy to compression material, and severe diabetic neuropathy with sensory loss or microangiopathy (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1959">Rabe, Partsch, Morrison, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h8"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Older patients have decreased strength and manual dexterity and may be unable to apply graduated compression stockings. If this is the case, a family member or friend should be taught to assist the patient to apply the stockings so that they do not cause excessive pressure on any part of the feet or legs. Frames and other devices have been designed to assist patients with applying stockings, and if there is any concern regarding patients&#x2019; physical abilities, they should be referred to an occupational therapist who can provide examples of and training in the use of stocking assistance devices (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Balcombe, Miller, &#x0026; McGuiness, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">External Compression Devices and Bandages</p>
<p class="nonindent">Short-stretch elastic bandages may be applied from the toes to the knee in a 50% spiral overlap. These bandages are available in a two-layer system, which includes an inner layer of soft padding. These bandages have extension indicators that are rectangular and become squares when extended correctly, which reduces the possibility of bandaging a leg too loosely or too tightly. Three- and four-layer systems are also available (e.g., Profore, Dyna-Care), but these may be used only once compared with the two-layer system, which can be used multiple times.</p>
<p class="indent">Other types of compression are available. The Unna boot, which consists of a paste bandage impregnated with zinc oxide, glycerin, gelatin, and sometimes calamine, is applied without tension in a circular fashion from the base of the toes to the tibial tuberosity with a 50% spiral overlap. The foot must remain dorsiflexed at a 90-degree angle to the leg, thus avoiding excess pressure or trauma to the anterior ankle area. Once the bandage dries, it provides a constant and consistent compression to the venous system. This type of compression may remain in place for as long as 1 week, although it may be too heavy for patients who are too frail to tolerate. The Unna boot is more commonly used with venous insufficiency.</p>
<p class="indent">The CircAid, a nonelastic leg wrap with a series of overlapping, interlocking Velcro straps, augments the effect of muscle while the patient is walking. The CircAid is usually worn during the day. Patients may find the CircAid easier to apply and wear than the Unna boot because it is lighter, can be removed to shower, and is adjustable. However, its adjustability may also be problematic; if patients loosen the straps, the compression achieved may not be adequate.</p>
<p class="h7">Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Devices</p>
<p class="nonindent">Intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used in conjunction with elastic bandages or graduated compression stockings to support venous circulation and prevent DVT. Compression devices consist of an electric controller that is attached by air hoses to either knee-high or thigh-high sleeves. The sleeves are divided into compartments, which sequentially fill to apply pressure to the ankle, calf, and thigh at variable pressures from 30 to 70 mm Hg. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices can increase blood velocity beyond that produced by elastic bandages or stockings. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices are prescribed for patients who are not physically able to apply compression bandages or wraps, or don a pair of stockings (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Nicolaides, 2020</a>). Nursing measures in caring for patients who use these devices include ensuring that sleeves are properly encircling the extremity and the prescribed pressures are set and not exceeded, assessing for patient comfort, and ensuring adherence to therapy.</p>
