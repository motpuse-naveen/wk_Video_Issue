<h4 class="h4" id="s3062">Guillain&#x2013;Barr&#x00E9; Syndrome</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Guillain&#x2013;Barr&#x00E9; Syndrome (GBS), also known as acute idiopathic polyneuritis, is an autoimmune attack on the peripheral nerve myelin. The result is acute, rapid segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves and some cranial nerves, producing ascending weakness with dyskinesia (inability to execute voluntary movements), hyporeflexia, and <strong>paresthesias</strong> (a sensation of numbness, tingling, or a &#x201C;pins and needles&#x201D; sensation). An antecedent event (most often a viral infection) precipitates clinical presentation in approximately 60% to 70% of cases (CDC, 2019). <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> (implicated in 40% of cases in the United States), cytomegalovirus, Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, H. influenzae,</em> and Zika virus are the most common infectious agents that are associated with the development of GBS.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several subtypes of GBS (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Malek &#x0026; Salameh, 2019</a>). With the most well-known type, the patient experiences weakness in the lower extremities, which progresses upward and has the potential for respiratory failure. The second type is purely motor with no altered sensation. A third type, called descending GBS, is much more difficult to diagnose; it mostly affects the head and neck muscles. The rarest type is the Miller&#x2013;Fisher variant (see discussion later in this chapter) (NINDS, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">The annual incidence of GBS is 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 people, and it affects males and females equally. Death occurs in 5% to 10% of cases, resulting from respiratory failure, autonomic dysfunction, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism (PE) (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Seventy percent of patients with GBS experience full recovery. The remaining 30% can have disability ranging from minor to major (NINDS, 2018b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3063">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">GBS is the result of a cell-mediated and humoral immune attack on peripheral nerve myelin proteins that causes inflammatory demyelination. The best-accepted theory of cause is molecular mimicry, in which an infectious organism contains an amino acid that mimics the peripheral nerve myelin protein. The immune system cannot distinguish between the two proteins and attacks and destroys peripheral nerve myelin. The exact location of the immune attack within the peripheral nervous system is the ganglioside GM1b. With the autoimmune attack, there is an influx of macrophages and other immune-mediated agents that attack myelin and cause inflammation and destruction, interruption of nerve conduction, and axonal loss (NINDS, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Myelin is a complex substance that covers nerves, providing insulation and speeding the conduction of impulses from the cell body to the dendrites. The cell that produces myelin in the peripheral nervous system is the Schwann cell. In GBS, the Schwann cell can be spared, allowing for remyelination in the recovery phase of the disease. If damage has occurred to the axons, then regrowth is required and takes months or years and is often incomplete (NINDS, 2018b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3064">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">GBS typically begins with muscle weakness and diminished reflexes of the lower extremities. Hyporeflexia and weakness may progress to tetraplegia. Demyelination of the nerves that innervate the diaphragm and intercostal muscles results in neuromuscular respiratory failure. Sensory symptoms include paresthesias of the hands and feet and pain related to the demyelination of sensory fibers.</p>
<p class="indent">The antecedent event usually occurs 1 to 3 weeks before symptoms begin. Weakness usually begins in the legs and may progress upward. Maximum weakness (the plateau) varies in length but usually includes neuromuscular respiratory failure and bulbar weakness. GBS progresses to peak severity typically within 2 weeks and no longer than 4 weeks. If progression is longer, then the patient is classified as having chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Any residual symptoms are permanent and reflect axonal damage from demyelination.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2103</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2104" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2104">p. 2104</span></div>
<p class="indent">Cranial nerve demyelination can result in a variety of clinical manifestations. Optic nerve demyelination may result in blindness. Bulbar muscle weakness related to demyelination of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves results in the inability to swallow or clear secretions. Vagus nerve demyelination results in autonomic dysfunction, manifested by instability of the cardiovascular system. The presentation is variable and may include tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, or orthostatic hypotension. The symptoms of autonomic dysfunction occur and resolve rapidly. GBS does not affect cognitive function or LOC.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the classic clinical features include areflexia and ascending weakness, variations in the clinical presentation occurs. There may be a sensory presentation, with progressive sensory symptoms; an atypical axonal destruction; or the Miller&#x2013;Fisher variant, which includes paralysis of the ocular muscles, ataxia, and areflexia (Malek &#x0026; Salameh, 2019; NINDS, 2018b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3065">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient presents with symmetric weakness, diminished reflexes, and upward progression of motor weakness. A history of a viral illness in the previous few weeks suggests the diagnosis. Changes in vital capacity and negative inspiratory force are assessed to identify impending neuromuscular respiratory failure. Serum laboratory tests are not useful in the diagnosis. However, elevated protein levels are detected in CSF evaluation, without an increase in other cells. Electrophysiology studies demonstrate a progressive loss of nerve conduction velocity (<a href="c64-sec15.xhtml#bib4481">Malek &#x0026; Salameh, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3066"><img src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the possibility of rapid progression and neuromuscular respiratory failure, GBS is a medical emergency that may require management in an intensive care unit. After baseline values are identified, assessment of changes in muscle strength and respiratory function alert the clinician to the physical and respiratory needs of the patient. Respiratory therapy or mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support pulmonary function and adequate oxygenation. Some clinicians recommend elective intubation before the onset of extreme respiratory muscle fatigue. Emergent intubation may result in autonomic dysfunction, and mechanical ventilation may be required for an extended period. The patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation after the respiratory muscles can again support spontaneous respiration and maintain adequate tissue oxygenation.</p>
<p class="indent">Other interventions are aimed at preventing the complications of immobility. These may include the use of anticoagulant agents and sequential compression boots to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE.</p>
<p class="indent">Therapeutic plasma exchange and IVIG are used to directly affect the peripheral nerve myelin antibody level. Both therapies decrease circulating antibody levels and reduce the amount of time the patient is immobilized and dependent on mechanical ventilation. The cardiovascular risks posed by autonomic dysfunction require continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Tachycardia and hypertension are treated with short-acting medications such as alpha-adrenergic blocking agents. The use of short-acting agents is important, because autonomic dysfunction is very labile. Hypotension is managed by increasing the amount of IV fluid administered.</p>

<p class="processptitleph1_1" id="nurse63"><strong>The Patient with GBS</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Ongoing assessment for disease progression is critical. The patient is monitored for life-threatening complications (respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, VTE [including DVT or PE]) so that appropriate interventions can be initiated. Because of the threat to the patient in this sudden, potentially life-threatening disease, the nurse must assess the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to cope and their use of coping strategies.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired breathing associated with rapidly progressive weakness and impending respiratory failure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired mobility associated with paralysis</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional intake associated with inability to swallow</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired verbal communication associated with cranial nerve dysfunction</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with loss of control and paralysis</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Fatigue associated with physical deconditioning and stressors</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Respiratory failure</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Autonomic dysfunction</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include improved respiratory function, increased mobility, improved nutritional status, effective communication, decreased anxiety, decreased fatigue, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> R<small>ESPIRATORY</small> F<small>UNCTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Respiratory function can be maximized with incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy. Monitoring for changes in vital capacity and negative inspiratory force is key to early intervention for neuromuscular respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation is required if the vital capacity falls, making spontaneous breathing impossible and tissue oxygenation inadequate.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The potential need for mechanical ventilation should be discussed with the patient and family on admission to provide time for psychological preparation and decision making. Intubation and mechanical ventilation result in less anxiety if they are initiated on a nonemergency basis to a patient who has been well informed. The patient may require mechanical ventilation for a long period. See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for the nursing management of the patient requiring mechanical ventilation.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2104</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2105" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2105">p. 2105</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Bulbar weakness that impairs the ability to swallow and clear secretions is another factor in the development of respiratory failure in the patient with GBS. Suctioning may be needed to maintain a clear airway.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses the blood pressure and heart rate frequently to identify autonomic dysfunction so that interventions can be initiated quickly if needed. Medications are given or a temporary pacemaker placed for clinically significant bradycardia.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> P<small>HYSICAL</small> M<small>OBILITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Nursing interventions to enhance physical mobility and prevent the complications of immobility are key to the function and survival of patients. The paralyzed extremities are supported in functional positions, and passive range-of-motion exercises are performed at least twice daily. DVT and PE are threats to the patient who is paralyzed. Nursing interventions are aimed at preventing VTE. Range-of-motion exercises, position changes, anticoagulation, the use of anti-embolism stockings and sequential compression boots, and adequate hydration decrease the risk of VTE.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Padding may be placed over bony prominences, such as the elbows and heels, to reduce the risk of pressure injury. The need for frequent position changes cannot be overemphasized. The nurse evaluates laboratory test results that may indicate malnutrition or dehydration, both of which increase the risk of pressure injury and decrease mobility. The nurse collaborates with the primary provider and dietitian to develop a plan to meet the patient&#x2019;s nutritional and hydration needs.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> A<small>DEQUATE</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Paralytic ileus may result from insufficient parasympathetic activity. In this event, the nurse administers IV fluids and parenteral nutrition as a supplement and monitors for the return of bowel sounds. If the patient cannot swallow because of bulbar paralysis (immobility of muscles), a gastrostomy tube may be placed to administer nutrients. The nurse carefully assesses the return of the gag reflex and bowel sounds before resuming oral nutrition.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> C<small>OMMUNICATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because of paralysis, the patient cannot talk, laugh, or cry and therefore has no method for communicating needs or expressing emotion. Although the patient may be unable to speak, cognition is completely intact. Establishing some form of communication with picture cards or an eye blink system provides a means of communication. Collaboration with the speech therapist may be helpful in developing a communication mechanism that is most effective for a specific patient.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>D<small>ECREASING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient and family are faced with a sudden, potentially life-threatening disease; therefore, their levels of anxiety may be high. The impact of disease on the family depends on the patient&#x2019;s role within the family. Referral to a support group may provide information and support to the patient and family.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The family may feel helpless in caring for the patient. Mechanical ventilation and monitoring devices may frighten and intimidate them. Family members often want to participate in physical care; with education and support by the nurse, they should be allowed and encouraged to do so.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition the patient may experience isolation, loneliness, lack of control, and fear. Nursing interventions that increase the patient&#x2019;s sense of control include providing information about the condition, emphasizing a positive appraisal of coping resources, and providing education about relaxation exercises and distraction techniques. The positive attitude and atmosphere of the multidisciplinary team are important to promote a sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Diversional activities are encouraged to decrease loneliness and isolation. Encouraging visitors (when possible), engaging visitors or volunteers to read to the patient, listening to musical recordings or audiobooks, assisting with audio visual communication with friends and family through a phone or electronic device, and watching television or movies are ways to alleviate the patient&#x2019;s sense of isolation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">R<small>EDUCING</small> F<small>ATIGUE</small></p>
<p class="processppara">The disease process increases disability and dependence on others for simple activities of living. As the patient begins to recover and regains the ability to perform activities on their own, they will find increased rest is needed to maintain this independence. The patient may need only a little help at the beginning of the day, but as the day progresses may require more assistance. Too much exertion will result in fatigue. The patient will need assistance learning how to pace their daily activities to incorporate periods of rest, both physically and mentally. The nurse can help identify activities that are physically demanding, assess the amount of sleep the patient is getting and needs, assist the patient and family to ensure time for self-care, and provide education about healthy eating to maintain strength.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3">M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Thorough assessment of respiratory function at regular and frequent intervals is essential, because respiratory insufficiency and subsequent failure due to weakness or paralysis of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm may develop quickly. Respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality, although rare. In addition to the respiratory rate and the quality of respirations, vital capacity is monitored frequently and at regular intervals so that respiratory insufficiency can be anticipated. Decreasing vital capacity with associated muscle weakness indicates impending respiratory failure. Signs and symptoms include breathlessness while speaking, shallow and irregular breathing, the use of accessory muscles, tachycardia, weak cough, and changes in respiratory pattern.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Other complications include cardiac arrhythmias (which necessitate ECG monitoring), transient hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, DVT, PE, urinary retention, and other threats to any patient who is immobilized and paralyzed. These complications require monitoring and attention to prevent them and prompt treatment if indicated.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="h4a"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Patients with GBS and their families are usually frightened by the sudden onset of life-threatening symptoms and their severity. Therefore, educating the patient and family about the disorder and its generally favorable prognosis is important (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct64-4">Chart&#x00A0;64-4</a></span>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During the acute phase of the illness, the patient and family are educated about strategies that can be implemented to minimize the effects of immobility and other complications. As function begins to return, family members and other home care providers are educated about care of the patient and their role in the rehabilitation process. Preparation for discharge is an interdisciplinary effort requiring family or caregiver education by all team members, including the nurse, physician, occupational and physical therapists, speech therapist, and respiratory therapist.</p>
