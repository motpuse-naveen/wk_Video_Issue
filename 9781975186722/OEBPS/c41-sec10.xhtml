<h4 class="h4" id="s1759">Colorectal Cancer</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tumors of the colon and rectum are relatively common; the colorectal area (the colon and rectum combined) is the third most common site of new cancer cases in the United States. In the United States, approximately 104,600 new cases and 53,200 deaths from colorectal cancer occur annually; these deaths include 3640 people under age 50 years (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3026">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2020</a>). Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in men or women and the second leading cause of cancer death among all adults in the United States (ACS, 2020). The WHO estimates there were 1.8 million new cases and nearly 861,000 deaths worldwide in 2018 (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Macrae &#x0026; Bendell, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The most significant risk factor for colorectal cancer is older age. The median age at diagnosis is now 66 years of age compared to the median age 20 years ago of 72 years of age (ACS, 2020). The median age at diagnosis is younger for rectal cancer (62 years for men and 63 years for women) (ACS, 2020). The incidence of colorectal cancer in adults over 50 years of age has been declining by approximately 2% annually (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Macrae &#x0026; Bendell, 2020</a>). This corresponds with an approximate 19% increase in colonoscopies being performed (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Simonson, 2018</a>). However, recent trends in epidemiologic data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (SEER) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) revealed that nearly one in seven new diagnoses of colorectal cancer were among adults younger than 50 years of age; furthermore, these patients were more likely to have more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. These cancers are largely left-sided cancers (i.e., more distal); rectal cancer is particularly prevalent among younger adults with colorectal cancer (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Macrae &#x0026; Bendell, 2020</a>). Research findings suggest that sedentary behavior in adults younger than 50 years of age might be linked to colorectal cancer (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3091">Nguyen, Liu, Zheng, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately 30% of patients with colorectal cancer have a family history of the disease (ACS, 2020). The exact cause of colon and rectal cancer is still unknown, but risk factors have been identified (see Chart 41-10). A specific form of hereditary colorectal cancer is <em>Lynch syndrome,</em> or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). HNPCC-defining cancers include those of the colorectum, uterus, stomach, ovaries, urinary epithelium, and small bowel. HNPCC is characterized by early age of onset. Another disorder with high risk of colorectal cancer is familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), in which patients develop hundreds of colonic polyps that can become malignant.</p>
<p class="indent">The stage at presentation affects the prognosis in colon cancer. If the disease is localized and treated before it spreads, the 5-year survival rate is 89%; with distant metastases, the survival rate drops to 15% (ACS, 2020). SEER estimates the overall 5-year survival rate for all stages at 67% (ACS, 2020). Many people are asymptomatic for long periods and seek health care only when they notice a change in bowel habits or rectal bleeding (ACS, 2020). Education, prevention, and early screening are key to detection and reduction of mortality rates.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1760">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer of the colon and rectum is predominantly (95%) adenocarcinoma (i.e., arising from the epithelial lining of the intestine) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>). It may start as a mutation of the adenomatous polyposis gene (<em>APC</em>), leading to malignancy. The genetic mutations are associated with the transformation of a benign polyp to invasive adenocarcinoma, which can invade and destroy normal tissues and extend into <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1326" title="1326"></span>surrounding structures. Cancer cells may migrate away from the primary tumor and spread to other parts of the body, most often to the liver, peritoneum, and lungs.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1761">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The symptoms are determined by the location of the tumor, the stage of the disease, and the function of the affected intestinal segment. The most common presenting symptom is a change in bowel habits. The passage of blood in or on the stools is the second most common symptom. Symptoms may also include unexplained anemia, anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue (ACS, 2020). Patients younger than 50 years of age may report abdominal pain rather than the usual &#x201C;alarm&#x201D; symptoms associated with colorectal cancer, which include rectal bleeding, a change in bowel habits, the presence of an abdominal mass, or anemia (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms most commonly associated with right-sided lesions (i.e., more proximal tumors) are dull abdominal pain and melena (i.e., black, tarry stools). Patients with right-sided tumors tend to have poorer outcomes than those with left-sided tumors. The symptoms most commonly associated with left-sided lesions are a change in bowel habits or those associated with obstruction (i.e., abdominal pain and cramping, narrowing stools, constipation, distention), as well as hematochezia (i.e., bright red blood in the stool). Symptoms associated with rectal lesions are tenesmus, rectal pain, the feeling of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement, alternating constipation and diarrhea, and bloody stool (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1762">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Screening is an effective method to identify and prevent colorectal cancer. Screening colonoscopies can reduce mortality by decreasing the incidence of and increasing the survival rates for patients with colorectal cancer (ACS, 2020). Colorectal cancer develops slowly from polyps in the colon or rectum and if identified early, can be removed before undergoing malignant transformation (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Simonson, 2018</a>). Screening recommendations differ based on the organization publishing the guidelines; differences include the frequency and method of screening and age to begin and discontinue screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all adults should begin periodic screening for colorectal cancer at the age of 50 years. Due to the increased incidence of colorectal cancer in people under age 50, the 2018 ACS guideline recommends screening begin at age 45 for people of average risk (ACS, 2020). Screening for high-risk people should begin earlier, based on their individual risk profile. The ACS offers information and guidelines for high-risk screening (see Resources). Whether or not to continue screening adults after the age of 75 years should be made based upon each patient&#x2019;s preference and overall health status. Adults older than 85 years of age should not continue to be screened (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec04.xhtml#tt12-3">Table 12-3</a>, for summary of colorectal cancer screening guidelines). Because colonoscopy is the only screening test that can also simultaneously remove precancerous polyps, thus preventing colorectal cancer, other experts recommend colonoscopies every 5 to 10 years beginning at the age of 50 years as the major screening test for colorectal cancer, including the American College of Gastroenterology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (see <a href="c38.xhtml">Chapter 38</a> for discussion of colonoscopies) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Cabebe, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A patient who has a tumor found on screening colonoscopy should have the tumor biopsied and tattooed during the colonoscopy to facilitate further workup. For the patient whose tumor was found on a diagnostic test other than a colonoscopy (e.g., flexible sigmoidoscopy, FIT), a colonoscopy is indicated to biopsy and tattoo the tumor (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rex, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is referred to a colorectal surgeon. The preoperative workup consists of a focused history, to determine if there are any symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (see previous discussion in Clinical Manifestations). A family history is done to screen for a genetic predisposition (e.g., Lynch syndrome, FAP). Laboratory studies are done, including a CBC (may or may not reveal anemia), chemistry panel (to determine baseline status), and liver function tests (to screen for possible liver metastasis). A baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is also obtained. CEA is a tumor marker that is recommended for assessing the presence of colorectal cancer, as well as its progression or recurrence, although it does yield both false positives and false negatives. However, at present there is no other readily available tumor marker test. Therefore, CEA is not used as the sole predictor of tumor status, including progression or recurrence. Other tests indicated include contrast CT scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and chest, to screen for extent of the tumor and any metastases (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Macrae &#x0026; Bendell, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1763">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tumor growth may cause partial or complete bowel obstruction or perforation. Extension of the tumor and ulceration into the surrounding blood vessels can result in hemorrhage. Each of these complications can be treated surgically. Obstruction may be resected without anastomosis (e.g., Hartmann procedure) (see <a href="c41-sec08.xhtml#ff41-4">Fig. 41-4</a>) or with anastomosis (e.g., colectomy or partial colectomy). Perforation typically carries a grim prognosis; it is typically treated with an ostomy. Acute hemorrhage is a rare complication; when it occurs, it is most effectively treated with surgical resection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1764"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Carcinomas of the colon and rectum are common malignancies in advanced age. In men, only the incidence of prostate cancer and lung cancer exceeds that of colorectal cancer. In women, only the incidence of breast cancer and lung cancer exceeds that of colorectal cancer (ACS, 2020). Symptoms are often insidious. Patients with colorectal cancer may report fatigue, which can be caused by iron deficiency anemia. In early stages, minor changes in bowel patterns and occasional bleeding may occur. The later symptoms most commonly reported by the older adult are abdominal pain, obstruction, tenesmus, and rectal bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Colon cancer in the older adult has been closely associated with dietary carcinogens. Lack of fiber is a major causative factor because the passage of feces through the intestinal tract is prolonged, which extends exposure to possible carcinogens. Excess dietary fat, high alcohol consumption, and smoking all increase the incidence of colorectal tumors. Physical activity and NSAIDs and aspirin have protective effects (ACS, 2020).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1326</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1327" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1327">p. 1327</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1765">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several primary prevention strategies might thwart the onset of colorectal cancer. Use of tobacco products is implicated in one third of all cancers, including colorectal cancer (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for discussion of smoking cessation programs). Physical activity, dietary modification, and weight reduction strategies mirror those for other cancers (see previous discussion of Life Style Factors in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) (ACS, 2020). In addition to these strategies, the USPSTF recommends that adults between the ages of 50 and 59 who are also at risk for developing cardiovascular disease, and who have no contraindication to aspirin, take daily or alternate-day aspirin (dosage &#x2265;75 mg) for 5 to 10 years, as an effective primary prevention strategy for both cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3019">Chubak, Kamineni, Buist, et al., 2015</a>). To date, there is no expert consensus guideline that advocates routine prescription of aspirin postcolorectal cancer diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1766">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment for colorectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease (see <a href="#tt41-8">Table 41-8</a>) and consists of surgery to remove the tumor, supportive therapy, and adjuvant therapy. Definitive staging can only be done after surgical excision.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is the mainstay of initial treatment for colorectal cancer. The goal is removal of the primary tumor with clean margins, including lymph nodes (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>). It may be curative or palliative. Advances in surgical techniques can enable the patient with rectal cancer to have sphincter-sparing devices that restore continuity of the GI tract. The type of surgery recommended depends on the location and size of the tumor (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who have Stage 0 tumors typically have endoscopic or laparoscopic excision of their tumors. Laparoscopic surgery for stage I, II, and III colorectal tumors achieves <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1328" title="1328"></span>equivalent oncologic outcomes to surgery done by traditional open laparotomy (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>). In addition, laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter hospital lengths of stay, fewer postoperative complications, improved pain control, and earlier progression to a normal diet. Possible surgical procedures include the following (note that only segmental resections with anastomoses may be done by laparoscope):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Segmental resection with anastomosis (i.e., removal of the tumor and portions of the bowel on either side of the growth, as well as the blood vessels and lymphatic nodes) (see <a href="#ff41-10">Fig. 41-10</a>)</span></li>
<li><span>Abdominoperineal resection with permanent sigmoid colostomy (i.e., removal of the tumor and a portion of the sigmoid and all of the rectum and anal sphincter, also called <em>Miles resection</em>) (see <a href="#ff41-11">Fig. 41-11</a>)</span></li>
<li><span>Temporary colostomy followed by segmental resection and anastomosis and subsequent reanastomosis of the colostomy, allowing initial bowel decompression and bowel preparation before resection</span></li>
<li><span>Permanent colostomy or ileostomy for palliation of unresectable obstructing lesions</span></li>
<li><span>Construction of a coloanal reservoir called a <em>colonic J-pouch,</em> which is performed in two steps. A temporary loop ileostomy is constructed to divert intestinal flow, and the newly constructed J-pouch (made from 6 to 10 cm of colon) is reattached to the anal stump. About 3 months after the initial stage, the ileostomy is reversed and intestinal continuity is restored. The anal sphincter and therefore continence are preserved</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">The colostomy can be created as a temporary or permanent fecal diversion. It allows the drainage or evacuation of colon contents to the outside of the body. The consistency of the drainage is related to the placement of the colostomy, which is dictated by the location of the tumor and the extent of invasion into surrounding tissues (see <a href="c41-sec09.xhtml#ff41-8">Fig. 41-8</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Adjuvant Therapy and Ongoing Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are referred to a medical oncologist for further management after they are discharged from the hospital after surgery. Patients at the lowest risk for recurrence (i.e., those with Stage 0 or I disease) do not require chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Those with Stage 0 disease do not require specific follow-up. Patients with stage I colorectal cancer should have follow-up colonoscopies 1-year postoperatively, then again in another 3 years, and then every 5 years.</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients with stage II disease do not require any adjuvant chemotherapy. However, some patients with stage II tumors have mutations in their DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR) that are classified as proficient (MMR-P). Patients in this subset have improved survival and less disease recurrence if they take the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic drug capecitabine for 6 months. In order to screen for the MMR-P gene, the tumor should be analyzed by a multigene assay (i.e., genetic test). Patients with stage II disease who may also benefit from capecitabine are those who had inadequately sampled lymph nodes, with T4-sized tumors, or with poorly differentiated tumors. Capecitabine is equivalent to the dual chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. It may be given either orally or intravenously. The most common adverse effects of capecitabine include anemia, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (i.e., hand-foot syndrome), which manifests by reddening, pain, and swelling of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (NCI, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with stage III tumors are typically prescribed the combination chemotherapeutic drug of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaplatin. This combination chemotherapeutic drug is usually given over 6 months, but there is some debate whether 3 months of treatment is as effective (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lee &#x0026; Chu, 2018</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3111">Sougklakos, Boukovinas, Xynogalos, et al., 2019</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1329" title="1329"></span>The 3-month treatment regimen is associated with less neurotoxicity (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>). The adverse effects mirror those of capecitabine, plus patients frequently experience cold sensitivity and paresthesias of their hands and feet, which typically cease after the chemotherapy is completed. An alternative treatment is now available, and consists of a combination drug of capecitabine and oxaliplatin for 3 or 6 months of therapy (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Patients with stage II or stage III tumors should have routine follow-ups and CEA testing every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. CT scans of the abdomen and chest should be done each year for 3 years. Colonoscopy should also be done 1-year postoperatively, and then every 5 years (NCI, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with stage IV or recurrent colorectal tumors have metastases to distant organs. The treatment is highly variable and individualized, based upon the extent of the tumor mass(es), and the health status and wishes of the patient. Treatment might consist of targeted therapy aimed at possible cure, or palliative care (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>). Chemotherapeutic drugs that might be tried include those previously described for treating stage II or stage III disease, as well as other categories of agents, including monoclonal antibodies (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab), and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents (e.g., bevacizumab, aflibercept), to name a few. When metastasis occurs, the liver is implicated half the time. Therapy targeted to treat metastases to the liver can include surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, and intra-arterial chemotherapy (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Dragovich, 2020</a>). Maintaining quality of life is an important goal for many patients with cancer, particularly those receiving palliative care (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3102">Rohde, Kersten, Vistad, et al., 2017</a>) (see Chart 41-11: Nursing Research Profile).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Spiritual Well-Being Among Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Rohde, G., Kersten, C., Vistad, I., et al. (2017). Spiritual well-being in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving noncurative chemotherapy: A qualitative study. <em>Cancer Nursing</em>, <em>40</em>(3), 209&#x2013;216.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Enhancing quality of life (QOL) for patients with noncurative cancer is an important treatment goal. The purpose of this study was to explore spiritual well-being, an important component of QOL, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Twenty patients ages 34 to 75 with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy were enrolled in this qualitative study in Norway. Researchers conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews over a 1-year period with hermeneutic editing for analyses. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL group&#x2019;s subthemes of spiritual well-being were used as a framework. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years or older with metastatic colorectal cancer referred for first- or second-line noncurative chemotherapy with an expected life expectancy that exceeded 6 months. Patients unable to read or understand Norwegian, or those with significant comorbidities or being treated with an investigational drug were excluded from the study. Participants varied in terms of sociodemographic data such as age, marital status, education level, and religious beliefs. Some examples of the interview questions included &#x201C;How do you experience your life after you became ill?&#x201D; &#x201C;How is your relationship with your nearest family and friends?&#x201D; Nineteen participant interviews were done in the hospital and 1 in the participant&#x2019;s home.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Low spiritual well-being is associated with low QOL in patients with cancer. Positive spiritual coping strategies may contribute to improved adjustment to illness, although evidence is mixed. Using the EORTC&#x2019;s model, the researchers identified subthemes of spiritual well-being, including <em>relationship with others</em> (strategies for inner harmony, sharing feelings with significant others), <em>existential issues</em> (coping with end-of-life thoughts) and <em>religious and/or spiritual beliefs and practices</em> (seeking faith as inner support). Participants identified and focused on short-term, positive, and achievable goals. Many reported an ability to live a good life, despite the prognosis. Some felt the ability to speak openly about their illness was a positive change and made relationships better. However, those who did not have good relationships before their illness did not see an improvement in relationships after their diagnosis. Some participants withheld information about their diagnosis and prognosis from their families by choice in an attempt to spare their feelings. When discussing end-of-life issues, trust between the provider and patient was very important. Some participants would have welcomed a provider initiating a discussion on existential issues, while others thought it would be intrusive.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer use cognitive, affective, and behavioral strategies to adjust to health-related changes in their QOL and spiritual well-being. In the process of seeking inner harmony, most participants in this study underwent a response shift when learning of their diagnosis and shift in what was important in their lives. They tried to find a balance between sadness and grief and positive feelings; others were less able to adjust to their illness and focused more on negative feelings and sadness. The participants in this study did not expect health care providers to initiate a conversation about spiritual well-being or other existential issues, although many would have appreciated the provider listening without being intrusive. Understanding QOL and spiritual well-being issues that patients with colorectal cancer face may allow the nurse to identify patients in need of developing positive coping strategies or to act as facilitator for communication between the patient and family.</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse obtains a health history about the presence of fatigue, abdominal or rectal pain (e.g., location, frequency, duration, association with eating or defecation), past and present elimination patterns, and characteristics of stool (e.g., color, odor, consistency, presence of blood or mucus). Additional information includes a history of IBD or colorectal polyps, a family history of colorectal disease, Lynch syndrome, or FAP, and current medication therapy. The nurse assesses dietary patterns, including fat and fiber intake, as well as amounts of alcohol consumed and history of smoking. The nurse describes and documents a history of weight loss and feelings of weakness and fatigue.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Assessment includes auscultation of the abdomen for bowel sounds and palpation of the abdomen for areas of tenderness, distention, and solid masses. Stool specimens are inspected for character and presence of blood.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include attainment of optimal level of nutrition; prevention of infection; maintenance of fluid balance; knowledge about the diagnosis, surgical procedure, and self-care after discharge; reduction of anxiety; maintenance of optimal tissue healing; and avoidance of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong> <img class="m" src="images/practice.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient awaiting surgery for colorectal cancer has many concerns, needs, and fears. They may be physically debilitated and emotionally distraught with concerns about lifestyle changes after surgery, prognosis, ability to perform in established roles, and finances. Priorities for nursing care include preparing the patient physically for surgery; providing information about postoperative care; and supporting the patient and family emotionally. An Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society pathway, first developed in 2005 and last revised in 2018, provides a care path developed for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery (i.e., colorectal surgery that is planned in advance, rather than done emergently) to reduce perioperative stress, reduce length of stay, and optimize patient outcomes (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3058">Gustafsson, Scott, Hubner, et al., 2018</a>). Multidisciplinary strategies included in the pathway are evidence-based and are associated with a reduction in morbidity, comparable or reduced 30-day hospital readmission rates, faster recovery, earlier discharge, and decreased costs (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Riccardi, MacKay, &#x0026; Joshi, 2019</a>). Despite advanced age, patients over 70 years managed with the ERAS pathway experienced similar benefits in terms of length of stay and postoperative outcomes as did younger patients who underwent colorectal surgery (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3066">Joris, Hans, Coimbra, et al., 2019</a>). (See <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> for further discussion of ERAS pathways.)</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> P<small>REOPERATIVE</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Maintaining Optimal Nutrition.</span> Physical preparation for surgery involves building the patient&#x2019;s stamina in the days preceding surgery. If the patient&#x2019;s condition permits, the nurse recommends a diet high in calories, protein, and carbohydrates and low in residue for several days before surgery to provide adequate nutrition and minimize cramping by decreasing excessive peristalsis. If the patient is hospitalized in the days preceding surgery, parenteral nutrition may be required to replace depleted nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. In some instances, parenteral nutrition is given at home before surgery (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Gustafsson et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Preventing Infection.</span> Postoperative infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following colorectal surgery (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rollins, Javanmard-Emamghissi, &#x0026; Lobo, 2018</a>). Preoperative mechanical bowel preparations (e.g., enemas, oral laxatives) traditionally have been prescribed to reduce fecal bulk and colonic bacteria. It had been posited that these measures would prevent postoperative complications of infection. However, findings from a meta-analysis suggest that these interventions do not reduce the rates of postoperative infectious complications among patients having colorectal surgery (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Rollins et al., 2018</a>). Nonetheless, there is a lack of consensus regarding best practices that might reduce the rates of infections. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons supports the use of mechanical bowel preparations for elective colorectal surgery only when accompanied by preoperative oral antibiotics (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3078">Migaly, Bafford, Francone, et al., 2019</a>). Antibiotics typically prescribed may include kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, neomycin, metronidazole, and cephalexin to be administered orally the day before surgery. IV antibiotics such as cefazolin and metronidazole are usually given within 60 minutes of the surgical incision (Gustaffsson et al., 2018).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Maintaining Fluid Volume Balance.</span> For the patient who is very ill and hospitalized, the nurse measures and records intake and output, including vomitus, to provide an accurate record of fluid balance. The patient&#x2019;s intake of oral food and fluids may be restricted to prevent vomiting. The nurse administers antiemetic agents as prescribed. Full or clear liquids may be tolerated, or the patient may be NPO. An NG tube may be inserted to drain accumulated fluids and prevent abdominal distention. The nurse monitors the abdomen for increasing distention, loss of bowel sounds, and pain or rigidity, which may indicate obstruction or perforation. It also is important to monitor IV fluids and electrolytes. Monitoring serum electrolyte levels can detect the hypokalemia and hyponatremia that occur with GI fluid loss. The nurse observes for signs of hypovolemia (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, decreased pulse volume); assesses hydration status; and reports decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and concentrated urine.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Providing Preoperative Education.</span> The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s knowledge about the diagnosis, prognosis, surgical procedure, and expected level of functioning after surgery. Education is provided about the preparations for surgery, the expected appearance and care of the wound, dietary restrictions, pain control, and medication management. All procedures are explained in language the patient understands. If the patient is going to have a colostomy, the nurse manages the plan of care as described previously (see Nursing Management of the Patient Requiring an Ostomy).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Providing Emotional Support.</span> Patients anticipating bowel surgery for colorectal cancer may be very anxious. They may grieve about the diagnosis and the impending surgery. The nurse&#x2019;s role is to assess the patient&#x2019;s anxiety level and coping mechanisms and suggest methods for reducing anxiety, such as deep-breathing exercises and visualizing a successful recovery from surgery and cancer. The nurse can arrange a meeting with a spiritual advisor if the patient desires or with the primary provider if the patient wishes to discuss the treatment or prognosis. To promote patient comfort, the nurse projects a relaxed, professional, and empathetic attitude.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> P<small>OSTOPERATIVE</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Postoperative nursing care for patients undergoing colon resection is similar to nursing care for any abdominal surgery patient (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>), including pain management during the immediate postoperative period. The nurse also monitors the patient for complications. The nurse assesses the abdomen for returning peristalsis and assesses the initial stool characteristics. It is important to help patients out of bed on the first postoperative day to prevent atelectasis, VTE, and accelerate the return of peristalsis (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3038">Chan, LeRoux, Stutzman, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Kaff, Wehner, &#x0026; Litkouhi, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Maintaining Optimal Nutrition.</span> The nurse educates the patient having surgery for colorectal cancer about the health benefits to be derived from consuming a healthy diet. The diet is individualized as long as it is nutritionally sound and does <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1332" title="1332"></span>not cause diarrhea or constipation. The return to normal diet is rapid.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Providing Wound Care.</span> The nurse frequently examines the abdominal dressing during the first 24 hours after surgery to detect signs of hemorrhage or infection. It is important to help the patient splint the abdominal incision during coughing and deep breathing to lessen tension on the edges of the incision. The nurse monitors temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate for elevations that may indicate an infectious process.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the malignancy has been removed using the perineal route, the perineal wound is observed for signs of hemorrhage. This wound may contain a drain or packing that is removed gradually. Bits of tissue may slough off for a week. This process is hastened by mechanical irrigation of the wound or with sitz baths performed two or three times each day initially. The condition of the perineal wound and any bleeding, infection, or necrosis is documented.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications.</span> The patient is observed for signs and symptoms of complications. The nurse monitors vital signs for increased temperature, pulse, and respirations and for decreased blood pressure that may indicate an intra-abdominal infectious process. It is important to frequently assess the abdomen, including bowel sounds and abdominal girth, to detect bowel obstruction. Rectal bleeding must be reported immediately because it indicates hemorrhage. The nurse monitors hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and administers blood component therapy as prescribed. Any abrupt change in abdominal pain is reported promptly. Elevated white blood cell counts and temperature or symptoms of shock are reported because they may indicate sepsis. The nurse administers antibiotics as prescribed. <a href="#tt41-9">Table 41-9</a> lists additional potential postoperative complications.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Some patients who are older with multiple comorbid conditions may need referral to a home care agency and the telephone number of the local chapter of the ACS. The home health nurse provides further care and education and assesses the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s adjustment. The home environment is assessed for adequacy of resources that allow the patient to manage self-care activities. A family member may assume responsibility for purchasing the equipment and supplies needed at home.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients need very specific directions about when to call their primary provider. They need to know which complications require prompt attention (i.e., bleeding, abdominal distention and rigidity, diarrhea, fever, wound drainage, and disruption of suture line). If chemotherapy is planned, the possible side effects (e.g., diarrhea, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, neuropathies) are reviewed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow"><em>Continuing and Transitional Care.</em></span> Ongoing care of the patient with cancer extends well beyond the initial hospital stay. Transitional care nurses who work in cancer care infusion centers manage follow-up care and coordinate adjuvant therapy and surveillance follow-ups. Some patients are interested in and can benefit from involvement in colorectal cancer support groups (see Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
