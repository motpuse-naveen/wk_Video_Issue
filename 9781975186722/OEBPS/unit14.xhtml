<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps_un14">A</span> 72-year-old female is due for a follow-up appointment at the outpatient ophthalmology clinic where you work. She has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol. During her previous visit, she reported her vision was blurred when watching television and that she stopped driving after dark as she could not see properly; she was subsequently diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy. However, there is an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within your community; the health network system that manages the ophthalmology clinic has responded by mandating that telehealth be used through video conference service to manage all patients for clinic visits. How will you assist the clinic staff as well as the patients, particularly this patient with poor vision, to make a rapid transition to telehealth visits while also assuring continued quality outcomes?</p>
<p class="UMUNT1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1895" title="1895"></span>QSEN Competency Focus: <span class="black">Informatics</span></p>
<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong><em>,</em> <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
