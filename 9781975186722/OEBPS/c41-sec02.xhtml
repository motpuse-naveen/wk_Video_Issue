<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diarrhea:&lt;/b&gt; an increased frequency of bowel movements or an increased amount of stool with altered consistency (i.e., increased liquidity) of stool">Diarrhea</button></strong> is an increased frequency of bowel movements (more than 3 per day) with altered consistency (i.e., increased liquidity) of stool. It can be associated with urgency, perianal discomfort, incontinence, nausea, or a combination of these factors (NIDDK, 2016b). Any condition that causes increased intestinal secretions, decreased mucosal absorption, or altered motility can produce diarrhea.</p>
<p class="indent">Diarrhea can be classified as acute, persistent, or chronic. Acute diarrhea is self-limiting, lasting 1 or 2 days; persistent diarrhea typically lasts between 2 and 4 weeks; and chronic diarrhea persists for more than 4 weeks and may return sporadically. Acute and persistent diarrheas are frequently caused by viral infections (e.g., norovirus). In addition, some drugs can cause acute or persistent diarrhea, including some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin) and magnesium-containing antacids (e.g., magnesium hydroxide). Chronic diarrhea may be caused by adverse effects of chemotherapy, antiarrhythmic agents, antihypertensive agents, metabolic and endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes, Addison disease, thyrotoxicosis), malabsorptive disorders (e.g., lactose intolerance, celiac disease), anal sphincter defect, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and by parasitic or <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infections (NIDDK, 2016b).</p>

<p class="indent"><em>C. difficile</em> is a gram-positive anaerobic organism and the most commonly identified bacterium in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Mada &#x0026; Alam, 2019</a>). Approximately half a million patients are infected annually, causing 15,000 deaths. Antibiotic use, including penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinalones, and clindamycin are known risk factors. More than half of patients admitted to the hospital will receive an antibiotic during their stay, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 30% to 50% of those antibiotics are either unnecessary or incorrectly prescribed (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Mada &#x0026; Alam, 2019</a>). Other risk factors for <em>C. difficile</em> infection include advanced age, the use of proton pump inhibitors or chemotherapy, and a history of chronic liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1687">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute and persistent diarrheas are classified as either noninflammatory (large-volume) or inflammatory (small-volume). Enteric pathogens that are noninvasive (e.g., <em>S. aureus, Giardia</em>) do not cause inflammation but secrete toxins that disrupt colonic fluid transport. They cause noninflammatory diarrhea, which is characterized by a large volume of loose, watery stools. Other pathogens that invade the intestinal mucosa and cause inflammatory changes typically result in smaller volumes of stool that is bloody (e.g., dysentery). Organisms implicated may include <em>Shigella, Salmonella,</em> and <em>Yersinia</em> species (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1290</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1291" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1291">p. 1291</span></div>
<p class="indent">Types of chronic diarrhea include secretory, osmotic, malabsorptive, infectious, and exudative. Secretory diarrhea is usually high-volume diarrhea. Often associated with bacterial toxins and chemotherapeutic agents used to treat neoplasms, it is caused by increased production and secretion of water and electrolytes by the intestinal mucosa into the intestinal lumen. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when water is pulled into the intestines by the osmotic pressure of unabsorbed particles, slowing the reabsorption of water. It can be caused by lactase deficiency, pancreatic dysfunction, or intestinal hemorrhage. Malabsorptive diarrhea combines mechanical and biochemical actions, inhibiting effective absorption of nutrients. Low serum albumin levels lead to intestinal mucosa swelling and liquid stool. Infectious diarrhea results from infectious agents invading the intestinal mucosa. Exudative diarrhea is caused by changes in mucosal integrity, epithelial loss, or tissue destruction by radiation or chemotherapy. Diarrhea may also be caused by laxative misuse (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1688">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the increased frequency and fluid content of stools, the patient usually has abdominal cramps, distention, borborygmus (i.e., a rumbling noise caused by the movement of gas through the intestines), anorexia, and thirst. Painful spasmodic contractions of the anus and tenesmus may occur with defecation. Other symptoms depend on the cause and severity of the diarrhea but are related to dehydration and to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.</p>
<p class="indent">Voluminous, greasy stools suggest intestinal <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;malabsorption:&lt;/b&gt; impaired transport across the mucosa">malabsorption</button></strong> (i.e., impaired transport across the mucosa), and the presence of blood, mucus, and pus in the stools suggests inflammatory enteritis or colitis. Oil droplets on the toilet water may be suggestive of pancreatic insufficiency. Nocturnal diarrhea may be a manifestation of diabetic neuropathy (NIDDK, 2016b; Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018). The possibility of <em>C. difficile</em> infection should be considered in all patients with unexplained diarrhea who are taking or have recently taken antibiotics.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1689">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When the cause of the diarrhea is not obvious, the following diagnostic tests may be performed: complete blood cell count (CBC); serum chemistries; urinalysis; routine stool examination; and stool examinations for infectious or parasitic organisms, bacterial toxins, blood, fat, electrolytes, and white blood cells. Endoscopy or barium enema may assist in identifying the cause.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1690">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common complication of diarrhea is dehydration. Dehydration with electrolyte loss (especially loss of potassium) may cause cardiac arrhythmias. Loss of bicarbonate with diarrhea can also lead to metabolic acidosis. Urinary output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 2 to 3 consecutive hours, muscle weakness, paresthesia, hypotension, anorexia, and drowsiness with a potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L (3.5 mmol/L) must be reported. Chronic diarrhea can also result in skin care issues related to irritant dermatitis (NIDDK, 2016b). Cleansing with a wet wipe and applying barrier cream can prevent dermatitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1691"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older patients can become dehydrated quickly and develop hypokalemia (low potassium levels) as a result of diarrhea. The nurse observes for clinical manifestations of muscle weakness, arrhythmias, or decreased peristaltic motility that may lead to paralytic ileus. The older patient taking digitalis (e.g., digoxin) must be aware of how quickly dehydration and hypokalemia can occur with diarrhea. The nurse educates the patient to recognize the symptoms of hypokalemia, because low levels of potassium potentiate the action of digitalis, leading to digitalis toxicity (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The skin of an older person is more sensitive to excoriation due to decreased turgor and reduced subcutaneous fat layers. Gentle cleansing with a perineal cleansing solution (i.e., wet wiping method) and the use of a barrier cream or a liquid skin sealant will prevent or treat the excoriation (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1692">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management is directed at controlling symptoms, preventing complications, and eliminating or treating the underlying disease. Until the definitive cause is discovered, infection control measures that restrict the transmission of infectious organisms (e.g., <em>C. difficile</em>&#x2013;associated diarrhea) are warranted (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for further discussion of <em>C. difficile</em> infection). Certain medications (e.g., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents) and antidiarrheal agents (e.g., loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine) may be prescribed to reduce the severity of the diarrhea and treat the underlying disease. In most cases, loperamide is the medication of choice because it has fewer side effects than diphenoxylate with atropine. Findings from a systematic review supported the use of probiotics (live organisms given to a host) in some forms of diarrhea (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Jones &#x0026; Cantor, 2019</a>). The specific organisms used were <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em> (yeast) or lactic acid bacteria such as <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Enterococcus lactic acid bacterium</em> species. Benefits include shortened duration of symptoms and early improvement of symptoms; there were no serious adverse effects reported (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Jones &#x0026; Cantor, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1693">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses and monitors the characteristics and pattern of diarrhea. A health history should address the patient&#x2019;s medication therapy, medical and surgical history, and dietary patterns and intake. Reports of recent acute illness or recent travel to another geographic area are important. Assessment includes abdominal auscultation and palpation for tenderness. Inspection of the abdomen, mucous membranes, and skin is important to determine hydration status. Stool samples are obtained for testing. The perianal area should also be assessed for skin excoriation.</p>
<p class="indent">During an episode of diarrhea, the patient is encouraged to increase intake of liquids and foods low in bulk until the symptoms subside. When the patient is able to tolerate food intake, the patient should avoid caffeine, alcoholic beverages, dairy products, and fatty foods for several days (NIDDK, 2016b). Antidiarrheal medications such as diphenoxylate with atropine or loperamide may be taken as prescribed. Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy may be necessary for rapid rehydration in some patients, especially in older adults and in patients with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1292" title="1292"></span>preexisting GI conditions (e.g., IBD). It is important to monitor serum electrolyte levels closely. The nurse immediately reports evidence of arrhythmias or a change in a patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent">The perianal area may become excoriated because diarrheal stool contains digestive enzymes that can irritate the skin. The patient should follow a perianal skin care routine to decrease irritation and excoriation (see <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a>).</p>
