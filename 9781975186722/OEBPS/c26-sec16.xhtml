<h4 class="h4" id="s1028">Leg Ulcers</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A leg ulcer is an excavation of the skin surface that occurs when inflamed necrotic tissue sloughs off. In the United States the most common lower extremity ulcerations have a venous etiology (estimated between 80% and 90%), with PAD the second leading cause. The coexistence of both venous and arterial disease is estimated to be present in 26% of patients with leg ulcers (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Singer, Tassiopoulos, &#x0026; Kirsner, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1029">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Inadequate exchange of oxygen and other nutrients in the tissue is the metabolic abnormality that underlies the development of leg ulcers. When cellular metabolism cannot maintain energy balance, cell necrosis (death) results. Alterations in blood vessels at the arterial, capillary, and venous levels may affect cellular processes and lead to the formation of ulcers.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1030">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The characteristics of leg ulcers are determined by the cause of the ulcer (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Ermer-Selton, 2016</a>). Most ulcers, especially in older patients, have more than one cause. The symptoms depend on whether the problem is arterial or venous in origin (see <a href="c26-sec01.xhtml#tt26-1">Table 26-1</a>). The severity of the symptoms depends on the extent and duration of the vascular insufficiency. The ulcer itself appears as an open, inflamed sore. The area may be exuding or covered by eschar (dark, hard crust).<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page855" title="855"></span></p>

<h6 class="h6">Arterial Ulcers</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic arterial disease is characterized by intermittent claudication. The patient may also complain of digital or forefoot pain at rest. If the onset of arterial occlusion is acute, ischemic pain is unrelenting and rarely relieved even with opioids. Typically, arterial ulcers are small, circular, deep ulcerations on the tips of toes or in the web spaces between the toes. Ulcers often occur on the medial side of the hallux or lateral fifth toe and may be caused by a combination of ischemia and pressure (see <a href="#ff26-16">Fig. 26-16</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Venous Ulcers</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic venous insufficiency is characterized by pain described as aching or heavy. The foot and ankle may be edematous. Ulcerations are in the area of the medial or lateral malleolus (gaiter area) and are typically large, superficial, and highly exudative. Venous hypertension causes extravasation of blood, which discolors the area (see <a href="#ff26-16">Fig. 26-16</a>). Studies report the average venous ulcer requires as long as 6 to 12 months to heal completely and in patients who do not adhere to compression therapy (see discussion later in the chapter), the recurrence rate is nearly 100% within 36 months (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Nicolaides, 2020</a>). Patients with neuropathy (e.g., a common occurrence in patients with diabetes) frequently have ulcerations on the side of the foot over the metatarsal heads. These ulcers are painless and are described in further detail in <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1031">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The cause of each ulcer needs to be identified so that appropriate therapy can be prescribed. The history of the condition is important in determining arterial or venous insufficiency. The pulses of the lower extremities (femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis) are carefully examined. More conclusive diagnostic aids include Doppler and duplex ultrasound studies, arteriography, and venography. Cultures of the ulcer bed may be necessary to determine whether an infection is contributing to tissue destruction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1032">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with ulcers can be effectively managed by advanced practice nurses or wound-ostomy-continence nurses in collaboration with the patients&#x2019; primary provider. All ulcers have the potential to become infected.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Antiseptic agents, such as povidone&#x2013;iodine, cadexomer iodine, and silver, inhibit growth and development of most microbes, are broad spectrum, generate relatively little antimicrobial resistance, and can be used for short periods of time. Once a wound is infected (e.g., erythema, induration, exudate, edema, wound breakdown, malodor), a systemic antibiotic is necessary (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1968">Swanson, Angel, Sussman, et al., 2016</a>). The specific antibiotic agent selected is based on culture and sensitivity test results. Oral antibiotics usually are prescribed because topical antibiotics have not proven to be effective for leg ulcers and promote antimicrobial resistance (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Swanson et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacologic therapy also is important in the management of wound-related pain.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Compression Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the circulatory status of the patient is assessed and an absolute ankle pressure of greater than 60 mm Hg and an ABI that exceeds 0.80 are confirmed, compression therapy can be used up to 40 mm Hg without impeding arterial perfusion (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Singer et al., 2017</a>). See the discussion on compression therapy in the Chronic Venous Insufficiency section.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cleansing and D&#x00E9;bridement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To promote healing, the wound bed is prepared by removing excessive wound exudate and nonviable tissue. The usual cleansing method is to flush the area with water or normal saline solution or clean it with a noncytotoxic wound-cleansing agent (Saf-Clens<sup>&#x2122;</sup>, Biolex<sup>&#x2122;</sup>, Restore<sup>&#x2122;</sup>). If this is unsuccessful, therapeutic wound cleansing and/or d&#x00E9;bridement may be necessary (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Swanson et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Therapeutic wound cleansing includes mechanical cleaning with a cleansing solution or gel such as:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)</span></li>
<li><span>Octenidine dihydrochloride</span></li>
<li><span>Superoxidised solution with hypochlorous acid (HOCL) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL)</span></li>
<li><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page856" title="856"></span>Povidone&#x2013;iodine</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Many older antiseptics are no longer recommended due to the risk of tissue damage associated with their use. However, these agents may still be used for wound management in low-resource settings, where alternative, contemporary antiseptics are not always available. Solutions not recommended include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Hydrogen peroxide</span></li>
<li><span>High-concentration sodium hypochlorite (EUSOL<sup>&#x2122;</sup>, Milton, Dakin&#x2019;s solution)</span></li>
<li><span>Chlorhexidine gluconate</span></li>
<li><span>Chlorhexidine gluconate and cetrimide (Savlon<sup>&#x2122;</sup>)</span></li>
<li><span>High-concentration acetic acid</span></li>
<li><span>Antibiotics for systemic administration</span></li>
<li><span>High-concentration potassium permanganate</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">D&#x00E9;bridement is the removal of nonviable tissue from wounds. Removing nonviable tissue is important, particularly for infection and biofilms (i.e., the microorganisms that grow on the surface of the wound). Biofilms have now been established as an important factor in wound healing and the need for serial d&#x00E9;bridement is important to disrupt the biofilm and allow the penetration of topical and systemic antimicrobial agent (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Swanson et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">D&#x00E9;bridement can be accomplished by several different methods:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Surgical d&#x00E9;bridement is the fastest method and can be performed by a primary provider under aseptic conditions using instruments to excise nonviable tissue. It is usually performed in the operating room with access to anesthesia and hemostasis.</span></li>
<li><span>Conservative sharp wound d&#x00E9;bridement can be performed at the bedside or in a clinic by a primary provider, skilled advanced practice nurse or wound-ostomy-continence nurse in collaboration with the primary provider or advanced practice nurse. Instruments are used to remove loose, avascular, and insensate nonviable tissue and topical anesthetics may be used to manage procedural pain.</span></li>
<li><span>Chemical d&#x00E9;bridement involves the application of chemical agents (e.g., cadexomer iodine, hypertonic saline) for the controlled removal of nonviable tissue. There may be some cytotoxic effects to healthy cells in the wound.</span></li>
<li><span>Ultrasonic d&#x00E9;bridement uses ultrasonography to disrupt the attachment of the nonviable tissue.</span></li>
<li><span>Hydrosurgical d&#x00E9;bridement uses a water-jet&#x2013;powered wound d&#x00E9;bridement tool to cut nonviable tissue.</span></li>
<li><span>Biologic d&#x00E9;bridement, or larval therapy, involves the deliberate infestation of disinfected fly larvae that secrete a proteolytic enzyme which liquifies and ingests nonviable tissues.</span></li>
<li><span>Enzymatic d&#x00E9;bridement involves the application of ointments containing enzymes. The ointment is applied to the ulcer but not to surrounding skin. Most enzymatic ointments are covered with a secondary dressing that will not soak up the ointment. The enzymatic ointment is discontinued when the nonviable tissue has been d&#x00E9;brided, and an appropriate wound dressing is applied.</span></li>
<li><span>Autolytic d&#x00E9;bridement is achieved through the application of dressings that allow the lysozymes in wound exudate to naturally break down the nonviable tissue. These include calcium alginate dressings (e.g., Kaltostat<sup>&#x2122;</sup>, Sorbsan<sup>&#x2122;</sup>) or gelling fiber dressings (e.g., Aquacel Hydrofiber<sup>&#x2122;</sup>) and may be used for d&#x00E9;bridement when absorption of exudate is needed. These dressings are changed when the exudate seeps through the secondary dressing, or at least every 7 days. Calcium alginate dressings can be used on areas that are bleeding after d&#x00E9;briding, because the material helps stop the bleeding. As the dry fibers absorb exudate, they become a gel that can be painlessly removed from the ulcer bed. Calcium alginate and gelling fiber dressings should not be used on dry or nonexudative wounds.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Nonselective d&#x00E9;bridement by applying and removing saline dressings of fine mesh gauze (wet to dry) are not recommended for vascular wounds because of the risk of removing viable tissue and wound-related pain. Preprocedural pain management is usually necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Arterial insufficiency may result in gangrene of the toe(s), or digital gangrene, which is usually caused by trauma. The toe is stubbed and then turns black (see <a href="#ff26-16">Fig. 26-16</a>). Usually, patients with this problem are older people without adequate circulation. D&#x00E9;bridement is contraindicated in these instances. Although the toe is gangrenous, it is dry. Managing dry gangrene is preferable to d&#x00E9;briding the toe and causing an open wound that will not heal because of insufficient circulation. If the toe were to be amputated, the lack of adequate circulation would prevent healing and might make higher-level amputation necessary&#x2014;a below- or an above-knee amputation. A higher-level amputation in an older adult could result in a loss of independence and possibly the need for institutional care. Dry gangrene of the toe in an older adult with poor circulation is usually left undisturbed. The nurse keeps the toe clean and dry, if it is stable, until it autoamputates or separates (without creating an open wound).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Topical Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A variety of topical agents can be used in conjunction with cleansing and d&#x00E9;bridement to promote healing of leg ulcers. The goals of treatment are to remove nonviable tissue and biofilm, and keep the ulcer clean and moist while healing takes place. The treatment should not destroy developing tissue. For topical treatments to be successful, adequate nutrition must be maintained.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Wound Dressing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Semiocclusive or occlusive wound dressings prevent evaporative fluid loss from the wound and retain warmth; these factors favor healing. When determining the appropriate dressing to apply, the following should be considered: simplicity of application, frequency of required dressing changes, ability to absorb wound exudate, expense, and patient comfort (see <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a> for further discussion of wound dressings).</p>
<p class="indent">Knowledge deficit, frustration, fear, anxiety, and depression can decrease the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s adherence with the prescribed therapy; therefore, patient and family education is necessary before beginning and throughout the wound care program.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Stimulated Healing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tissue-engineered human skin equivalent (e.g., Apligraf<sup>&#x2122;</sup> [Graftskin<sup>&#x2122;</sup>]) is a skin product cultured from human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes used in combination with therapeutic compression. When applied, it interacts with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page857" title="857"></span>the patient&#x2019;s cells within the wound to stimulate the production of growth factors. Application is not difficult, no suturing is involved, and the procedure is painless. A dermal repair scaffold (e.g., PriMatrix<sup>&#x2122;</sup>) is a bioactive and regenerative extracellular matrix that binds with the patient&#x2019;s own cells and growth factors. PriMatrix<sup>&#x2122;</sup> has been used successfully for tunneling wounds, as well as wounds with exposed tendon and bone, in which Apligraf<sup>&#x2122;</sup> cannot be used. Dermagraft<sup>&#x2122;</sup>, which is a human fibroblast&#x2013;derived dermal replacement, demonstrates efficacy similar to Apligraf<sup>&#x2122;</sup> (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Nicolaides, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hyperbaric Oxygenation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment in patients with diabetes with no signs of wound healing after 30 days of standard wound treatment. HBO is accomplished by placing the patient into a chamber that increases barometric pressure while the patient is breathing 100% oxygen. Treatment regimens vary from 90 to 120 minutes once daily for 30 to 90 sessions. The process by which HBO is thought to work involves several mechanisms. The edema in the wound area is decreased because high oxygen tension facilitates vasoconstriction and enhances the ability of leukocytes to phagocytize and kill microbes. In addition, HBO is thought to increase diffusion of oxygen to the hypoxic wound, thereby enhancing epithelial migration and improving collagen production. The two most common adverse effects of HBO are middle-ear barotrauma and confinement anxiety. The benefit from this therapy on wound healing in patients without diabetes is unclear (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Bonifant &#x0026; Holloway, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Negative Pressure Wound Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Research suggests that negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) using vacuum-assisted closure (e.g., VAC<sup>&#x2122;</sup>) devices decreases time to healing in complex wounds that have not healed in a 3-week period. Groin incisions, common in vascular surgery, may be complicated by wound dehiscence, lymphatic fistula, or infections in 5% to 10% of patients. NPWT has been found to be effective in treating patients who develop postoperative groin wound infections, decreasing hospital lengths of stay, rates of graft infection, and likelihood of limb loss (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1911">Apelqvist, Willy, Fagerdahl, et al., 2017</a>). Patients who are ambulatory may be given small, portable NPWT devices, giving them the freedom to perform their ADLs (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1934">Harding, Chrysostomou, Mohamud, et al., 2017</a>). Additional features such as instillation therapy (Veraflow<sup>&#x2122;</sup>) are now available. This therapy facilitates cleansing via instillation of fluid followed by a negative pressure cycle. Research to evaluate the microbial load and changes in the bacterial spectrum in wounds while using a growing number of NPWT devices is ongoing (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1942">Kim, Applewhite, Dardano, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">A focused nursing history and assessment are important. The extent and type of pain are carefully assessed, as are the appearance and temperature of the skin of both legs. The quality of all peripheral pulses is assessed, and the pulses in both legs are compared. The legs are checked for edema. If the extremity is edematous, the degree of edema is determined. Any limitation of mobility and activity that results from vascular insufficiency is identified. The patient&#x2019;s nutritional status is assessed, and a history of diabetes, collagen disease, or varicose veins is obtained.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph30"><strong><small>NURSING DIAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired skin integrity associated with vascular insufficiency</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired mobility associated with activity restrictions of the therapeutic regimen and pain</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional status associated with increased need for nutrients that promote wound healing</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Infection</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Gangrene</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include restoration of skin integrity, improved physical mobility, adequate nutrition, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Caring for these patients can be challenging, whether the patient is in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home. Leg ulcers are often long term and disabling causing a substantial drain on the patient&#x2019;s physical, emotional, and economic resources.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong><small>RESTORING SKIN INTEGRITY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">To promote wound healing, measures are used to keep the area clean. Cleansing requires very gentle handling, a neutral skin cleanser, and lukewarm water. Positioning of the legs depends on whether the ulcer is of arterial or venous origin. If there is arterial insufficiency, the patient should be referred for evaluation of vascular reconstruction. If there is venous insufficiency, dependent edema can be avoided by elevating the lower extremities and initiating graduated compression therapy. A decrease in edema promotes the exchange of cellular nutrients and waste products in the area of the ulcer, promoting healing.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Avoiding trauma to the lower extremities is imperative in promoting skin integrity. Heel suspension devices such as protective boots may be used (e.g., Rooke vascular boots, Prevalon); they are soft and provide warmth and protection from injury and displace tissue pressure to prevent pressure injury. If the patient is on bed rest or has reduced mobility, it is important to relieve pressure on the heels to prevent heel pressure injuries. When the patient is in bed, a bed cradle can be used to relieve pressure from bed linens and to prevent anything from touching the legs. When the patient is ambulatory, all obstacles are moved from the patient&#x2019;s path so that the patient&#x2019;s legs are not bumped. Heating pads, hot-water bottles, or hot baths are avoided, because they increase the oxygen demands and thus the blood flow demands of the already compromised tissue. The patient with diabetes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page858" title="858"></span>and neuropathy has decreased sensation; therefore, heating pads may cause a burn without the patient noticing.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><small>IMPROVING PHYSICAL MOBILITY</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Generally, physical activity is initially restricted to promote wound healing. When infection resolves and healing begins, ambulation should resume gradually and progressively. Activity promotes arterial blood flow and venous return and is encouraged after the acute phase of the ulcer process. Until full activity is resumed, the patient is advised to move about when in bed, to turn from side to side frequently, and to exercise the upper extremities to maintain muscle tone and strength. Meanwhile, diversional activities are encouraged. Consultation with an occupational therapist and physical therapist may be helpful if prolonged immobility and inactivity are anticipated.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If pain limits the patient&#x2019;s activity, analgesic agents may be prescribed. The wound-related pain is typically chronic and often disabling. Analgesic agents may be taken before scheduled activities to help the patient participate more comfortably.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><small>PROMOTING ADEQUATE NUTRITION</small></p>
<p class="processppara">Nutritional deficiencies are common, requiring dietary alterations to remedy them. There is conflicting evidence that dietary supplementation aids in healing of ulcerations. Comorbidities that may contribute to ulceration may also cause ongoing inflammation, disuse atrophy, and other metabolic disturbances; these may have a greater effect on wound healing than nutritional intake. Further research is needed; however, eating a diet that is high in protein, vitamins C and A, iron, and zinc is encouraged to promote healing (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Bonifant &#x0026; Holloway, 2019</a>). Particular consideration should be given to iron intake, because many patients are older adults who are at risk for iron deficiency anemia. After a dietary plan has been developed that meets the patient&#x2019;s nutritional needs and promotes healing, dietary instruction is provided to the patient and family.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><small>PROMOTING HOME, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND TRANSITIONAL CARE</small></p>
<p class="processppara">The self-care program is planned with the patient so that activities that promote arterial and venous circulation, relieve pain, and promote tissue integrity are encouraged. Reasons for each aspect of the program are explained to the patient and family. Leg ulcers are often chronic and difficult to heal; they frequently recur, even when the patient follows the plan of care. Long-term care of the feet and legs to promote healing of wounds and prevent recurrence of ulcerations is the primary goal. Leg ulcers increase the patient&#x2019;s risk of infection, may be painful, and may limit mobility, necessitating lifestyle changes. Participation of family members and home health care providers may be necessary for treatments such as dressing changes, reassessments, reinforcement of instruction, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the plan of care. Regular follow-up with a primary provider is necessary.</p>
