<h4 class="h4" id="s897">Valve Replacement</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Valve replacement is preferred for patients with valves with anatomy which decreases the chance of success with repair; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page773" title="773"></span>this includes valves that have extensive calcification, or with severely fibrotic or fused leaflets, chordae tendineae, or papillary muscles. Ideally, a multidisciplinary team (e.g., cardiologists, cardiac thoracic surgeons, structural valve interventionalists, anesthesiologists, nurses) will work together with the patient to determine candidacy for surgical versus more minimally invasive replacement (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1834">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). General anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass are used for surgical valve replacements. The standard surgical procedure is performed through a median sternotomy (i.e., incision through the sternum), although the mitral valve may be approached through a right thoracotomy incision.</p>

<p class="indent">Mitral and aortic valve replacements may be performed with minimally invasive techniques that do not involve cutting through the length of the sternum. Instead, a 2- to 4-inch incision is made in only the upper or lower half of the sternum or between ribs, or performed percutaneously. Some minimally invasive procedures are robot assisted; surgical instruments are connected to a robot, and the surgeon, watching a video display, uses a joystick to control the robot and surgical instruments. With these procedures, patients have lower rates of bleeding, pain, infection, and scarring, and shorter length of stay in the hospital (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1834">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">After the valve is visualized, leaflets of the aortic or pulmonic valve are removed, but some or all of the mitral valve structures (leaflets, chordae, and papillary muscles) are left in place to help maintain the shape and function of the left ventricle after mitral valve replacement. Sutures are placed around the annulus and then through the valve prosthesis. The replacement valve is slid down the suture into position and tied into place (<a href="#ff24-6">Fig. 24-6</a>). The patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, the quality of the surgical repair is often assessed with color flow Doppler TEE, and then surgery is completed.</p>
<p class="indent">TAVR, a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement procedure, may be performed in a catheterization laboratory or hybrid room. It does not involve cardiopulmonary bypass or sternotomy. TAVR was traditionally used only for patients who could not safely undergo surgical valve replacement, but more recently has been recommended for patients who have intermediate or even low risk (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1835">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). With the patient under general anesthesia, a balloon valvuloplasty is performed. Then, a bioprosthetic (tissue) replacement valve (<a href="#ff24-7">Fig. 24-7</a>A,B) attached to a catheter is inserted percutaneously, positioned at the aortic valve, and implanted. The MitraClip has been approved as a transcatheter procedure to treat degenerative forms of mitral regurgitation. This procedure is currently used primarily in patients with severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation and high surgical risk, but increasingly is considered even for lower-risk patients. The procedure creates a mechanical bridge between two leaflets and has demonstrated decreased regurgitant flow, resulting in fewer symptoms, and decreased rates of hospitalization for heart failure (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Dahl &#x0026; Ailawadi, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In patients requiring valve replacement or repair, the heart had gradually adjusted to the pathology; surgery abruptly &#x201C;corrects&#x201D; the way blood flows through the heart and may result in complications related to the sudden changes in intracardiac pressures. All prosthetic valve replacements create a degree of stenosis when they are implanted in the heart. Usually, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page774" title="774"></span>stenosis is mild and does not affect heart function. If valve replacement was for a stenotic valve, blood flow through the heart is often improved, and signs and symptoms of heart failure resolve in a few hours or days. If valve replacement was for a regurgitant valve, it may take months for the chamber into which blood had been regurgitating to achieve its optimal postoperative function. Signs and symptoms of heart failure resolve gradually as heart function improves. Patients are at risk for many postoperative complications, such as bleeding, thromboembolism, infection, heart failure, hypertension, arrhythmias, hemolysis, and mechanical obstruction of the valve.</p>

<p class="indent">Several types of mechanical and tissue valve prostheses may be used (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Chikwe &#x0026; Castillo, 2017</a>) (<a href="#ff24-7">Fig. 24-7</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s898">Mechanical Valves</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical valves are of the bileaflet (<a href="#ff24-7">Fig. 24-7C</a>), tilting disc (<a href="#ff24-7">Fig. 24-7D</a>), or caged ball (<a href="#ff24-7">Fig. 24-7E</a>) design and are thought to be more durable than tissue prosthetic valves (<a href="#ff24-7">Fig. 24-7F</a>); therefore, they often are used for younger patients. These valves also are used for patients requiring valve replacement who also have kidney injury, hypercalcemia, endocarditis, or sepsis, since mechanical valves do not deteriorate or become infected as easily as tissue valves. Significant complications associated with mechanical valves are thromboemboli and complications that can be associated with long-term use of required anticoagulants (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s899">Tissue Valves</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are three types of tissue valves: bioprostheses, homografts, and autografts. Tissue valves are less likely than mechanical valves to generate thromboemboli, and long-term anticoagulation is not required. Tissue valves are not as durable as mechanical valves and require replacement more rapidly (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Chikwe &#x0026; Castillo, 2017</a>; <a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1834">Nishimura et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bioprostheses</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Bioprostheses</strong> are valves made from animal tissues (i.e., heterografts) used for aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve replacement. They are not thrombogenic; therefore, patients do not need long-term anticoagulation therapy. They are used for women of childbearing age to avoid potential complications of long-term anticoagulation associated with menses, placental transfer to a fetus, and delivery of a child. They also are considered for patients older than 70 years and others who cannot tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Most bioprostheses are from pigs (porcine), but some are from cows (bovine) or horses (equine). They may be stented or nonstented. Viability is 7 to 15 years.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Homografts</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Homografts</strong>, also called allografts (i.e., human valves), are obtained from cadaver tissue donations and are used for aortic and pulmonic valve replacement. The aortic valve and a portion of aorta or the pulmonic valve and a portion of pulmonary artery are harvested and stored cryogenically. Homografts are not always available and are very expensive. They last for about 10 to 15 years and are typically used in younger patients who require replacement of the valve root (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1847">Tudorache, Horke, Cebotari, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Autografts</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Autografts</strong> (i.e., autologous valves) are obtained by excising the patient&#x2019;s own pulmonic valve and a portion of the pulmonary artery for use as the aortic valve. Anticoagulation is unnecessary because the valve is the patient&#x2019;s own tissue and is not thrombogenic. The autograft is an alternative for children (it may grow as the child grows), women of childbearing age, young adults, patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, and people who cannot tolerate anticoagulation. Aortic valve autografts have remained viable for more than 20 years (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1828">Mazine, El-Hamamsy, Verma, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). If pulmonary vascular pressures are normal, some surgeons elect not to then replace the pulmonic valve. Patients can recover without a valve between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.</p>

<p class="indent">However, most aortic valve autograft procedures are double valve replacement procedures with a homograft pulmonic valve replacement also performed. If there is recurrent valve dysfunction after this procedure, patients may undergo further corrective surgery, often in the form of a reversal of the original homograft. In patients who are older and for whom this may no longer be an option, replacement with a prosthetic valve may be considered (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1816">Hussain, Majdalany, Dunn, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
