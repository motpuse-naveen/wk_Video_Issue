<h4 class="h4" id="s821">Cardioversion and Defibrillation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cardioversion and defibrillation are used to treat tachyarrhythmias by delivering an electrical current that depolarizes a critical mass of myocardial cells. When the cells repolarize, the SA node is usually able to recapture its role as the heart&#x2019;s pacemaker.</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img src="images/xxvi-3.png" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt"><em>One major difference between cardioversion and defibrillation is the timing of the delivery of electrical current. In cardioversion, the delivery of the electrical current is synchronized with the patient&#x2019;s electrical events; in defibrillation, the delivery of the current is immediate and unsynchronized.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent1">The same type of device, called a <em>defibrillator,</em> is used for both cardioversion and defibrillation. The electrical voltage required to defibrillate the heart is usually greater than that required for cardioversion and may cause more myocardial damage. Only biphasic types of defibrillators are now manufactured; these deliver an electrical charge from one paddle that then automatically redirects its charge back to the originating paddle. Because the delivery of the electrical charge varies among devices, the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommended dose should be followed for the first and subsequent defibrillations (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The electrical current may be delivered externally through the skin with the use of paddles or with conductor pads. The paddles or pads may be placed on the front of the chest (standard placement) (see <a href="#ff22-23">Fig.&#x00A0;22-23</a>), or one pad may be placed on the front of the chest and the other pad placed under the patient&#x2019;s back just left of the spine (anteroposterior placement) (see <a href="#ff22-24">Fig.&#x00A0;22-24</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Defibrillator multifunction conductor pads contain a conductive medium and are connected to the defibrillator to allow for hands-off defibrillation. This method reduces the risk of touching the patient during the procedure and increases electrical safety. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs), which are now found in many public areas, use this type of delivery for the electrical current.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>When using paddles, the appropriate conductant is applied between the paddles and the patient&#x2019;s skin. Any other type of conductant, such as ultrasound gel, should not be substituted.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Whether using pads or paddles, the nurse must observe two safety measures. First, good contact must be maintained between the pads or paddles and the patient&#x2019;s skin (with a conductive medium between them) to prevent electrical current from leaking through the air (arcing) when the defibrillator is discharged. Second, no one is to be in contact with the patient or with anything that is touching the patient when the defibrillator is discharged, to minimize the chance that electrical current is conducted to anyone other than the patient. <a href="#ct22-5">Chart&#x00A0;22-5</a> provides a review of nursing responsibility when a patient is cardioverted or defibrillated.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Assisting with External Defibrillation or Cardioversion</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">When assisting with external defibrillation or cardioversion, the nurse should remember these key points:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Multifunction conductor pads or paddles are used, with a conducting medium between the paddles and the skin in the proper locations. The conducting medium is available as a sheet, gel, or paste. Gels or pastes with poor electrical conductivity (e.g., ultrasound gel) should not be used.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Paddles or pads should be placed so that they do not touch the patient&#x2019;s clothing or bed linen and are not near medication patches or in the direct flow of oxygen.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Women with large breasts should have the left pad or paddle placed underneath or lateral to the left breast.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>During cardioversion, the monitor leads must be attached to the patient in order to set the defibrillator to the synchronized mode (&#x201C;in sync&#x201D;). If defibrillating, the defibrillator must <em>not</em> be in the synchronized mode (most machines default to the &#x201C;not-sync&#x201D; mode).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When using paddles, 20&#x2013;25 lb of pressure must be used in order to ensure good skin contact.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When using a manual discharge device, it must not be charged until it is ready to shock; then thumbs and fingers must be kept off the discharge buttons until paddles or pads are on the chest and ready to deliver the electrical charge.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When it is time to defibrillate, whomever is delivering the charge should announce, &#x201C;charging to (number of joules)&#x201D; prior to discharging.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>&#x201C;Clear!&#x201D; must be called three times before discharging: As &#x201C;Clear&#x201D; is called the first time, the discharger must visually check that they are not touching the patient, bed, or equipment; as &#x201C;Clear&#x201D; is called the second time, the discharger must visually check that no one else is touching the bed, the patient, or equipment, including the endotracheal tube or adjuncts; and as &#x201C;Clear&#x201D; is called the third time, the discharger must perform a final visual check to ensure that everyone is clear of the patient and anything touching the patient.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The delivered energy and resulting rhythm are recorded.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is immediately resumed after the defibrillation charge is delivered, if appropriate, starting with chest compressions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If CPR is necessary, after five cycles (about 2 minutes) of CPR, the cardiac rhythm is checked again and another shock is delivered, if warranted. A vasoactive or antiarrhythmic medication is given as soon as possible after the rhythm check to facilitate a positive response to defibrillation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>After the event is complete, the skin under the pads or paddles is inspected for burns; if any are detected, the primary provider or a wound care nurse is consulted about appropriate treatment.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The defibrillator is plugged back into an outlet, and supplies are restocked as needed.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s822">Electrical Cardioversion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Electrical cardioversion involves the delivery of a &#x201C;timed&#x201D; electrical current to terminate a tachyarrhythmia. In cardioversion, the defibrillator is set to synchronize with the ECG on a cardiac monitor so that the electrical impulse discharges during ventricular depolarization (QRS complex). The synchronization prevents the discharge from occurring during the vulnerable period of repolarization (T wave), which could result in VT or ventricular fibrillation. The ECG monitor connected to the external defibrillator usually displays a mark or line that indicates sensing of a QRS complex. Sometimes the lead and the electrodes must be changed for the monitor to recognize the patient&#x2019;s QRS complex. When the synchronizer is on, no electrical current is delivered if the defibrillator does not discern a QRS complex. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the patient is connected to the monitor and to select a lead (not &#x201C;paddles&#x201D;) that has the most appropriate sensing of the QRS. Because there may be a short delay until recognition of the QRS, the discharge buttons of an external manual defibrillator must be held down until the shock has been delivered. In most monitors, the synchronization mode must be reactivated if the initial cardioversion was ineffective and another cardioversion is needed (i.e., the device defaults to unsynchronized defibrillation mode).</p>
<p class="indent">If the cardioversion is elective and the arrhythmia has lasted longer than 48 hours, anticoagulation for a few weeks before cardioversion may be indicated (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Digoxin is usually withheld for 48 hours before cardioversion to ensure the resumption of sinus rhythm with normal conduction. The patient is instructed not to eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the procedure. Gel-covered paddles or conductor pads are positioned anteroposteriorly (front and back) for cardioversion. Before cardioversion, the patient receives moderate sedation IV as well as an analgesic medication or anesthesia. Respiration is then supported with supplemental oxygen delivered by a bag-valve mask device with suction equipment readily available. Although patients rarely require intubation, equipment is nearby in case it is needed. The amount of voltage used varies from 50 to 360 joules, depending on the defibrillator&#x2019;s technology, the type and duration of the arrhythmia, and the size and hemodynamic status of the patient (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Indications of a successful response are conversion to sinus rhythm, adequate peripheral pulses, and adequate blood pressure. Because of the sedation, airway patency must be maintained and the patient&#x2019;s state of consciousness assessed. Vital signs and oxygen saturation are monitored and recorded until the patient is stable and recovered from sedation and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page714" title="714"></span>analgesic medications or anesthesia. ECG monitoring is required during and after cardioversion (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s823">Defibrillation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Defibrillation is used in emergency situations as the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless VT, the most common cause of abrupt loss of cardiac function and sudden cardiac death. Defibrillation is not used for patients who are conscious or have a pulse. The energy setting for the initial and subsequent shocks using a monophasic defibrillator should be set at 360 joules (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The energy setting for the initial shock using a biphasic defibrillator may be set at 150 to 200 joules, with the same or an increasing dose with subsequent shocks (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The sooner defibrillation is used, the better the survival rate (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Hedge &#x0026; Gnugnoli, 2019</a>). Several studies have demonstrated that early defibrillation performed by lay people in a community setting can increase the survival rate (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Hedge &#x0026; Gnugnoli, 2019</a>). If immediate CPR is provided and defibrillation is performed within 5 minutes, more adults in ventricular fibrillation may survive with intact neurologic function (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The availability and the use of AEDs in public places can shorten the interval from collapse to rhythm recognition and defibrillation, which can significantly improve survival out of the hospital (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Hedge &#x0026; Gnugnoli, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Epinephrine is given after initial unsuccessful defibrillation to make it easier to convert the arrhythmia to a normal rhythm with the next defibrillation. This medication may also increase cerebral and coronary artery blood flow. Antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone, lidocaine, or magnesium may be given if ventricular arrhythmia persists (see <a href="c22-sec07.xhtml#tt22-1">Table&#x00A0;22-1</a>). This treatment with continuous CPR, medication administration, and defibrillation continues until a stable rhythm resumes or until it is determined that the patient cannot be revived.</p>
