<h4 class="h4" id="s95">Integrating Genetic and Genomic Knowledge</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Scientific developments and advances in technology have increased our understanding of genetics, promoted prompt genetic screening and genetic testing for common and rare genetic disorders, and improved patient health outcomes (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib379">Khoury et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Scientists are able to characterize inherited metabolic variations that interact over time and lead to common diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and dementia. The transition from genetics to genomics has increased understanding of how multiple genes act and control biologic processes. Many diseases are the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Khoury, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s96">Genes and Their Role in Human Variation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Genes are central components of human health and disease. The Human Genome Project has linked basic human genetics to human development, health, and disease (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib393">NIH, NHGRI, 2018</a>). Knowledge that specific genes are associated with specific genetic conditions makes diagnosis possible, even in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page119" title="119"></span>unborn. Many common conditions have genetic causes, and many more associations between genetics, health, and disease continue to be identified.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genes and Chromosomes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A person&#x2019;s unique genetic composition, called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;genotype:&lt;/b&gt; the genetic structure and the variations therein that a person inherits from their parents">genotype</button></strong>, is made up of approximately 25,000 genes (NIH, NLM, 2019c). A person&#x2019;s <strong>phenotype&#x2014;</strong>the observable characteristics or expression of their genotype&#x2014;includes physical appearance and other biologic, physiologic, and molecular traits. Environmental influences modify every person&#x2019;s phenotype, even phenotypes with a major genetic component. This concept of genotype and phenotype applies to a person&#x2019;s total genome and the respective traits of their genetic makeup.</p>
<p class="indent">The concepts of genotype and phenotype also apply to specific diseases. For example, in hypercholesterolemia, the genotype refers to specific apolipoprotein genes (<em>LDLR, APOB, LDLRAP1,</em> or <em>PCSK9</em>) that involve mutations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which control lipid metabolism (NIH, NLM, 2019d). Whereas, phenotype is characterized by early onset of cardiovascular disease, high levels of LDL, skin xanthomas, and a family history of heart disease. A person&#x2019;s genotype, consisting of normal functioning genes as well as some mutations, is characterized by physical and biologic traits that may predispose to disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Human growth and development and disease occur as a result of both genetic and environmental influences and interactions. The contribution of genetic factors may be large or small. For example, in a person with cystic fibrosis or phenylketonuria (PKU), the genetic contribution is significant. In contrast, the genetic contribution underlying a person&#x2019;s response to infection may be less applicable.</p>
<p class="indent">A single gene is conceptualized as a unit of heredity. A gene is composed of a segment of <strong>deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</strong> that contains a specific set of instructions for making the protein or proteins needed by body cells for proper functioning. Genes regulate both the types of proteins made and the rate at which proteins are produced. The structure of the DNA molecule is referred to as a double helix. The essential components of the DNA molecule are sugar&#x2013;phosphate molecules and pairs of nitrogenous bases. Each nucleotide contains a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA is composed of two paired strands, each made up of a number of nucleotides. The strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases (<a href="#ff6-1">Fig.&#x00A0;6-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Genes are arranged in a linear order within <strong>chromosomes</strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, which are microscopic structures located in the cell nucleus. In humans, 46 chromosomes occur in pairs in all body cells except oocytes (eggs) and sperm, which each contains only 23 unpaired chromosomes. Twenty-two pairs of chromosomes, called <em>autosomes,</em> are the same in females and males. The 23rd pair is referred to as the sex chromosomes. A female has two X chromosomes, whereas a male has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. At conception, each parent normally gives one chromosome of each pair to their child. As a result, children receive half of their chromosomes from fathers and half from mothers (<a href="#ff6-2">Fig.&#x00A0;6-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Careful examination of DNA sequences from many people shows that these sequences have multiple versions in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page120" title="120"></span>population. The different versions of these sequences are called <em>alleles.</em> Sequences found in many forms are said to be polymorphic, meaning that there are at least two common forms of a particular gene.</p>

This set is from a male, because it contains a Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Cell Division</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The human body grows and develops as a result of the process of cell division. Mitosis and meiosis are two distinctly different types of cell division.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Mitosis</em> is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and repair. During mitosis, the chromosomes of each cell duplicate. The result is two cells, called <em>daughter cells,</em> each of which contains the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The daughter cells are said to be diploid because they contain 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Mitosis occurs in all cells of the body except oocytes and sperm.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Meiosis,</em> in contrast, occurs only in reproductive cells and is the process by which oocytes and sperm are formed. During meiosis, a reduction in the number of chromosomes takes place, resulting in oocytes or sperm that contain half the usual number, or 23 chromosomes. Oocytes and sperm are referred to as haploid because they contain a single copy of each chromosome, compared to the usual two copies in all other body cells. During meiosis, as the paired chromosomes come together in preparation for cell division, portions cross over, and an exchange of genetic material occurs before the chromosomes separate. This event, called <em>recombination,</em> creates greater diversity in the makeup of oocytes and sperm.</p>
<p class="indent">During the process of meiosis, a pair of chromosomes may fail to separate completely, creating a sperm or oocyte that contains either two copies or no copy of a particular chromosome. This sporadic event, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nondisjunction:&lt;/b&gt; the failure of a chromosome pair to separate appropriately during cell division, resulting in abnormal chromosome numbers in daughter cells">nondisjunction</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, can lead to either a trisomy or a monosomy (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson, Marks, May, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Down syndrome is an example of trisomy, in which people have three copies of chromosome number 21. Turner syndrome is an example of monosomy, in which girls have a single X chromosome, causing them to have short stature and infertility (NIH, NLM, 2019e).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gene Mutations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Within each cell, many intricate and complex interactions regulate and express human genes. Gene structure and function, transcription and translation, and protein synthesis are all involved. Alterations in gene structure and function and the process of protein synthesis may influence a person&#x2019;s health. Changes in gene structure, called <strong>mutations</strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, permanently change the sequence of DNA, which in turn can alter the nature and type of proteins made (<a href="#ff6-3">Fig.&#x00A0;6-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some gene mutations have no significant effect on the protein product, whereas others cause partial or complete changes. How a protein is altered and its importance to body functioning determines the impact of the mutation. Gene mutations may occur in hormones, enzymes, or other important protein products, with significant implications for health and disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic condition caused by a small gene mutation that affects protein structure, producing hemoglobin S. A person who inherits two copies of the hemoglobin S gene mutation has sickle cell disease and experiences the symptoms of severe anemia and thrombotic organ damage resulting from hypoxia (NIH, NLM, 2019f).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff6-3">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff6-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff6-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;6-3 &#x2022;</span> When a gene contains a mutation, the protein encoded by that gene is likely to be abnormal. Sometimes the protein is able to function, although it does so imperfectly. In other cases, it is totally disabled. The outcome depends not only on how the mutation alters the protein&#x2019;s function but also on how vital that particular protein is to survival.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Other gene mutations include deletion (loss), insertion (addition), duplication (multiplication), or translocation (rearrangement) of a longer DNA segment (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, Huntington disease, and fragile X syndrome are examples of conditions caused by gene mutations.</p>
<p class="indent">Gene mutations may be inherited or acquired. Inherited or germline gene mutations are present in the DNA of all body cells and are passed on in reproductive cells from parent to child. Germline or hereditary mutations are passed on to all daughter cells when body cells replicate (<a href="#ff6-4">Fig.&#x00A0;6-4</a>). The gene that causes Huntington disease is one example of a germline mutation.</p>
<p class="indent">Spontaneous mutations take place in individual oocytes or sperm at the time of conception. A person who carries the new &#x201C;spontaneous&#x201D; mutation may pass on the mutation to his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page121" title="121"></span>or her children. Achondroplasia, Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 are examples of genetic conditions that may occur in a single family member as a result of spontaneous mutation.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff6-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff6-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff6-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;6-4 &#x2022;</span> Hereditary mutations are carried in the DNA of the reproductive cells. When reproductive cells containing mutations combine to produce offspring, the mutation is present in all of the offspring&#x2019;s body cells.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<div class="figure" id="ff6-5">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff6-5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff6-5.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;6-5 &#x2022;</span> Acquired mutations develop in DNA during a person&#x2019;s lifetime. If the mutation arises in a body cell, copies of the mutation will exist only in the descendants of that particular cell.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Acquired mutations take place in somatic cells and involve changes in DNA that occur after conception, during a person&#x2019;s lifetime. Acquired mutations develop as a result of cumulative changes in body cells other than reproductive cells (<a href="#ff6-5">Fig.&#x00A0;6-5</a>). Somatic gene mutations are passed on to the daughter cells derived from that particular cell line.</p>
<p class="indent">Gene mutations occur in the human body all the time. Cells have built-in mechanisms by which they can recognize mutations in DNA, and in most situations, they correct the changes before they are passed on by cell division. However, over time, body cells may lose their ability to repair damage from gene mutations, causing an accumulation of genetic changes that result in diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and disorders associated with aging (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Khoury, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genetic Variation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic variations occur among all people. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, referred to as &#x201C;snips&#x201D;) is the term used to identify common genetic variations that occur most frequently throughout the human genome (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). SNPs are changes in a single nucleotide (an A, T, C, or G) of the DNA sequence. For example, a normal DNA sequence of A<strong>A</strong>GG could change to ATGG; in this case, there is one single nucleotide change from A to T. Most SNPs do not alter normal cell function. Some SNPs do alter gene function and may influence disease development. Knowledge about SNPs that affect biologic function will help pinpoint individuals who may be more prone to common diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Information on SNPs has helped to clarify why some individuals metabolize drugs differently (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018a). For example, a polymorphism or SNP can alter protein or enzyme activity of medications. If the SNP causes a variation in drug transport or drug metabolism, the drug&#x2019;s action, half-life, or excretion could lead to lack of drug response or drug toxicity.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Epigenetics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Epigenetics refers to generational changes within the genetic instruction (NIH, NLM, 2019b). Over time, epigenetic influences can cause cellular change throughout the lifetime of the affected person and be passed on to subsequent generations. Epigenomics, which is the study of epigenetics, is an expanding area of research that correlates epigenetics to cancer, psychiatric disorders, obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune disease (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s97">Inheritance Patterns</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing assessment of the patient&#x2019;s health includes obtaining and recording family history information in the form of a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pedigree:&lt;/b&gt; a diagrammatic representation of a family history">pedigree</button></strong> (i.e., a diagrammatic representation of a family history). This is a first step in establishing the pattern of inheritance. Nurses must be familiar with mendelian patterns of inheritance and pedigree construction and analysis to help identify patients and families who may benefit from further genetic counseling, testing, and treatment (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Mendelian conditions are genetic conditions that are inherited in fixed proportions among generations. They result from gene mutations that are present on one or both chromosomes of a pair. A single gene inherited from one or both parents can cause a mendelian condition. Mendelian conditions are classified according to their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked. The terms dominant and recessive refer to the trait, genetic condition, or phenotype but not to the genes or alleles that cause the observable characteristics (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Autosomal Dominant Inheritance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dominant:&lt;/b&gt; a genetic trait that is normally expressed when a person has a gene mutation on one of a pair of chromosomes and the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; form of the gene is on the other chromosome">dominant</button></strong> refers to the trait of the gene that is expressed when two genes do not mirror each other on matched chromosomes. Autosomal dominant inherited conditions affect female and male family members equally and follow a vertical pattern of inheritance in families (<a href="#ff6-6">Fig.&#x00A0;6-6</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page122" title="122"></span>The presence of an autosomal dominant inherited condition only requires a genetic mutation on one of the chromosomes associated with that pair. Each of that person&#x2019;s offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene mutation for the condition and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal version of the gene (<a href="#ff6-7">Fig.&#x00A0;6-7</a>). Offspring who do not inherit the gene mutation do not develop the condition and do not have an increased chance for having children with the same condition. <a href="#tt6-2">Table&#x00A0;6-2</a> presents characteristics and examples of different patterns of inherited conditions.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff6-6">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff6-6.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff6-6.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;6-6 &#x2022;</span> Three-generation pedigree illustrating autosomal dominant inheritance.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

<p class="indent">Autosomal dominant conditions often manifest with varying degrees of severity. Some affected people may have significant symptoms, whereas others may have only mild ones. This characteristic is referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;variable expression:&lt;/b&gt; variation in the degree to which a trait is manifested; clinical severity">variable expression</button></strong><strong>;</strong> it results from the influences of genetic and environmental factors on clinical presentation.</p>
<p class="indent">Another phenomenon observed in autosomal dominant inheritance is penetrance, or the percentage of people known to have a particular gene mutation who actually show the trait. Almost complete penetrance is observed in conditions such as achondroplasia, in which nearly 100% of people with the gene mutation typically display traits of the disease. However, in some conditions, the presence of a gene mutation does not invariably mean that a person has or will develop an autosomal inherited condition. For example, a woman who has the <em>BRCA1</em> hereditary breast cancer gene mutation has a lifetime risk of breast cancer that can be as high as 80%, not 100%. This quality, known as reduced or incomplete penetrance, indicates the probability that a given gene will produce disease. In other words, a person may inherit the gene mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition but may not have any of the observable physical or developmental features of that condition. However, this person carries the gene mutation and still has a 50% chance of passing the gene for the condition to each of their children (NIH, NLM, 2019g). One of the effects of incomplete penetrance is that the gene appears to &#x201C;skip&#x201D; a generation, thus leading to errors in interpreting family history and in genetic counseling.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Autosomal Recessive Inheritance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The term <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;recessive:&lt;/b&gt; a genetic trait that is expressed only when a person has two copies of a mutant autosomal gene or a single copy of a mutant X-linked gene in the absence of another X chromosome">recessive</button></strong> refers to a genetic trait that is expressed only when a person has two copies of a mutant autosomal gene or a single copy of a mutant X-linked gene in the absence of another X chromosome. In contrast to autosomal dominant conditions, autosomal recessive conditions have a pattern that is more horizontal than vertical; relatives of a single generation tend to have the condition (<a href="#ff6-8">Fig.&#x00A0;6-8</a>). Autosomal recessive conditions are frequently seen among particular ethnic groups and usually occur more often in children of parents who are related by blood, such as first cousins (see <a href="#tt6-2">Table&#x00A0;6-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In autosomal recessive inheritance, each parent carries a gene mutation on one chromosome of the pair and a normal gene on the other chromosome. The parents are said to be <strong>carriers</strong> of the gene mutation. Unlike people with an autosomal dominant condition, carriers of a gene mutation for a recessive condition do not have symptoms of the genetic condition. When carriers have children together, there is a 25% chance that each child may inherit the gene mutation from both parents and have the condition (<a href="#ff6-9">Fig.&#x00A0;6-9</a>). Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and PKU are examples of autosomal recessive conditions (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">X-Linked Inheritance</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;X-linked:&lt;/b&gt; located on the X chromosome">X-linked</button></strong> conditions may be inherited in recessive or dominant patterns (see <a href="#tt6-2">Table&#x00A0;6-2</a>). In both, the gene mutation is located on the X chromosome. All males inherit an X chromosome from mothers and a Y chromosome from fathers for a normal sex constitution of 46, XY. Because males have only one X chromosome, they do not have a counterpart for its genes, as do females. This means that a gene mutation on the X chromosome of a male is expressed even though it is present in only one copy. Females, on the contrary, inherit one X chromosome from each parent for a normal sex constitution of 46, XX. A female may be an unaffected carrier of a gene mutation, or she may be affected if the condition results from a gene mutation causing an X-linked dominant condition. Either the X chromosome that she received from her mother or the X chromosome she received from her father may be passed on to each of her offspring, and this is a random occurrence.</p>

Each child has one chance in four of inheriting two abnormal alleles and developing the disorder; one chance in four of inheriting two normal alleles; and two chances in four of inheriting one normal and one altered allele&#x2014;therefore, being a carrier like both parents.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The most common pattern of X-linked inheritance is that in which a female is a carrier for a gene mutation on one of her X chromosomes. This is referred to as X-linked recessive inheritance, in which a female carrier has a 50% chance of passing on the gene mutation to a son, who would be affected, or to a daughter, who would be a carrier like her mother (<a href="#ff6-10">Fig.&#x00A0;6-10</a>). Examples of X-linked recessive conditions include factor VIII and factor IX hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mitochondrial Inheritance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The mitochondrium is an organelle, a cellular component associated with generating cellular energy. Although it is not a part of the nucleus, genetic alterations can occur in the mitochondria and be passed to offspring. These disorders are typically associated with muscle or nerve tissue. Unique to mitochondrial inheritance is that only the mother will pass the mitochondrial DNA to her offspring, and thus the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page124" title="124"></span>genetic disorder to her children, and all of her children will inherit the disorder. Examples of mitochondrial inheritance include Leber&#x2019;s hereditary optic neuropathy, Leigh syndrome, and Kearns&#x2013;Sayre syndrome (Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018; see <a href="#tt6-2">Table&#x00A0;6-2</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Multifactorial Inheritance and Complex Genetic Conditions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many birth defects and common health conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, osteoarthritis, and diabetes occur as a result of interactions of multiple gene mutations and environmental influences. Thus, they are called <em>multifactorial</em> or <em>complex conditions</em> (see <a href="#tt6-2">Table&#x00A0;6-2</a>). Other examples of multifactorial genetic conditions include neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly. Multifactorial conditions may cluster in families; however, they do not always result in the characteristic pattern of inheritance seen in families who have mendelian inherited conditions (<a href="#ff6-11">Fig.&#x00A0;6-11</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Nontraditional Inheritance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although mendelian conditions manifest with a specific pattern of inheritance in some families, many diseases and traits do not follow these simple patterns. Various factors influence how a gene performs and is expressed. Different mutations in the same gene can produce variable symptoms in different people, as in cystic fibrosis. Different mutations in several genes can lead to identical outcomes, as in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Some traits involve simultaneous mutation in two or more genes. A phenomenon known as genetic imprinting can determine which of a pair of genes (that of the mother or the father) is silenced or activated. This form of inheritance has been observed in Angelman syndrome, a severe form of intellectual disability and ataxia (NIH, NLM, 2019h).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s98">Chromosomal Differences and Genetic&#x00A0;Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Differences in the number or structure of chromosomes are a major cause of birth defects, intellectual disability, and malignancies. Chromosomal differences most commonly involve an extra or missing chromosome; this is called <em>aneuploidy.</em> These genetic alterations are neither inherited nor passed down through generations. Whenever there is an extra or missing chromosome, there is always associated intellectual or physical disability to some degree (NIH, <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib392">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [NCATS], 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is a common chromosomal condition that occurs with greater frequency in pregnancies of women who are 35 years of age or older. A person with trisomy 21 has a complete extra chromosome 21, which causes a particular facial appearance and increased risk of congenital heart defects, thyroid and vision problems, and intellectual disability. Other examples of chromosomal differences include trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, both more severe than Down syndrome, and conditions involving extra or missing sex chromosomes, such as Turner syndrome (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Chromosomal differences may also involve a structural rearrangement within or between chromosomes. These are less common than chromosomal conditions in which there is an extra or missing chromosome (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib392">NIH, NCATS, 2017</a>). People who carry &#x201C;balanced&#x201D; chromosome rearrangements have all of their chromosomal material; however, it is rearranged. Women with a &#x201C;balanced&#x201D; chromosomal rearrangement have an increased risk of spontaneous pregnancy loss and of having children with an unbalanced chromosomal arrangement that may result in physical or intellectual disability. Known carriers of these chromosomal differences are offered prenatal counseling and testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Chromosome studies may be needed at any age, depending on the indication. Two common indications for these studies include a suspected diagnosis of Down syndrome or a history of two or more unexplained pregnancy losses. Chromosome studies are accomplished by obtaining a tissue sample (e.g., blood, skin, and amniotic fluid), preparing and staining the chromosomes, and analyzing them under a microscope. The microscopic study of chromosomes, called <em>cytogenetics,</em> is used with molecular techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which permits more detailed examination of chromosomes (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib375">Jackson et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). FISH is useful to detect small abnormalities and to characterize chromosomal rearrangements.</p>
