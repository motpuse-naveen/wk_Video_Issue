<h4 class="h4" id="s1494">Bone Tumors</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Neoplasms of the musculoskeletal system are of various types, including osteogenic, chondrogenic, fibrogenic, muscle (rhabdomyogenic), and marrow (reticulum) cell tumors as well as nerve, vascular and fatty cell tumors. They may be primary tumors or metastatic tumors from cancers elsewhere in the body (e.g., breast, lung, prostate, kidney).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1495">Benign Bone Tumors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Benign tumors of the bone and soft tissue are more common than malignant primary bone tumors. Benign bone tumors generally are slow growing, well circumscribed, and encapsulated; present few symptoms; and are not a cause of death. Benign masses include osteochondroma, enchondroma, bone cysts, osteoid osteoma, rhabdomyoma, and fibroma. Some benign tumors have the potential to become malignant.</p>
<p class="indent">Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. It usually occurs as a large projection of bone at the end of long bones (at the knee or shoulder), developing during growth. It then becomes a static bony mass. In fewer than 1% of patients, the cartilage cap of the osteochondroma may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1146" title="1146"></span>undergo malignant transformation after trauma, and a chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma may develop (<a href="#bib2639">Czerniak, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone cysts are expanding lesions within the bone. Aneurysmal (widening) bone cysts are seen in young adults, who present with a painful, palpable mass of the long bones, vertebrae, or flat bone. Unicameral (single cavity) bone cysts occur more often in the first two decades of life and cause mild discomfort and possible pathologic fractures of the upper humerus and femur, which may heal spontaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">An osteoid osteoma is a painful tumor that occurs in children and young adults. The neoplastic tissue is surrounded by reactive bone formation that can be identified by x-ray. Enchondroma is a common tumor of the hyaline cartilage that develops in the hand, femur, tibia, or humerus. Usually, the only symptom is a mild ache. Pathologic fractures may occur in both types of tumors.</p>
<p class="indent">Giant cell tumors (osteoclastomas) are benign for long periods but may invade local tissue and cause destruction. They occur in young adults and are soft and hemorrhagic. Eventually, giant cell tumors may undergo malignant transformation and metastasize (<a href="#bib2639">Czerniak, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1496">Malignant Bone Tumors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary malignant musculoskeletal tumors are relatively rare and arise from connective and supportive tissue cells (sarcomas) or bone marrow elements (multiple myeloma; see <a href="c30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a>). Malignant primary musculoskeletal tumors include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas include liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma of soft tissue, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Bone tumor metastasis to the lungs is common (<a href="#bib2639">Davis, James, &#x0026; Saifuddin, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Osteosarcoma is the most common and most often fatal primary malignant bone tumor. Prognosis depends on whether the tumor has metastasized to the lungs at the time the patient seeks health care. It appears most frequently in children, adolescents and young adults (in bones that grow rapidly), in older adults with Paget disease of the bone, and in people with a prior history of radiation exposure. Clinical manifestations typically include localized bone pain that may be accompanied by a tender, palpable soft tissue mass. The primary lesion may involve any bone, but the most common sites are the distal femur, the proximal tibia, and the proximal humerus.</p>
<p class="indent">Malignant tumors of the hyaline cartilage are called <em>chondrosarcomas.</em> These tumors are the second most common primary malignant bone tumors affecting middle aged and older adults (<a href="#bib2639">Hornicek, 2019</a>). They may grow and metastasize slowly or very fast, depending on the characteristics of the tumor cells involved (i.e., grade). Patients with low-grade chondrosarcomas tend to have a much better prognosis than those with high-grade chondrosarcomas. See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for a discussion of tumor grades. The usual tumor sites include the pelvis, femur, humerus, spine, scapula, and tibia. Metastasis to the lungs occurs in fewer than half of patients. These tumors may recur after excision.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Metastatic Bone Disease</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Metastatic bone disease (secondary bone tumor) is more common than primary bone tumors (<a href="#bib2598">Mu, Shen, Liang, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Tumors arising from tissues elsewhere in the body may invade the bone and produce localized bone destruction (lytic lesions) or bone overgrowth (blastic lesions). The most common primary sites of tumors that metastasize to bone are the kidney, prostate, lung, breast, ovary, and thyroid (<a href="#bib2598">Mu et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Metastatic tumors are most frequently found in the skull, spine, pelvis, femur, and humerus and often involve more than one bone (polyostotic).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1497">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A tumor in the bone causes the normal bone tissue to react by osteolytic response (bone destruction) or osteoblastic response (bone formation). Adjacent normal bone responds to the tumor by altering its normal pattern of remodeling. The bone&#x2019;s surface changes, and the contours enlarge in the tumor area.</p>
<p class="indent">Malignant bone tumors invade and destroy adjacent bone tissue (<a href="#bib2598">Mu et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Benign bone tumors, in contrast, have a symmetric, controlled growth pattern and place pressure on adjacent bone tissue. Malignant bone tumors invade and weaken the structure of the bone until it can no longer withstand the stress of ordinary use; pathologic fracture commonly results.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1498">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with metastatic bone tumor may have a wide range of associated clinical manifestations. They may be symptom free or have pain that ranges from mild and occasional to constant and severe, varying degrees of disability, and, at times, obvious bone growth. Weight loss, malaise, and fever may be present. The tumor may be diagnosed only after pathologic fractures occur or as an incidental finding.</p>
<p class="indent">With spinal metastasis, spinal cord compression may occur. It can progress rapidly or slowly. Neurologic deficits (e.g., progressive pain, weakness, gait abnormality, paresthesia, paraplegia, urinary retention, loss of bowel or bladder control) must be identified early and treated with decompression laminectomy to prevent permanent spinal cord injury.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1499">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The differential diagnosis is based on the history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies, including CT, myelography, arteriography, MRI, biopsy, and biochemical assays of the blood and urine. General bone scans lack specificity. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, although more expensive than other diagnostic tests, are assuming a larger role in whole body surveys after the initial diagnosis (<a href="#bib2639">Hornicek, 2019</a>). PET scans generate images of the metabolic activity of cells and highlight metastatic bone disease when an increase uptake of radioactive substances is noted. A surgical or core needle biopsy is performed for histologic identification. Extreme care is taken during the biopsy to prevent seeding and resultant recurrence after excision of the tumor. Chest x-rays are performed to determine the presence of lung metastasis. Surgical staging of musculoskeletal tumors is based on tumor grade and site (intra- or extracompartmental), as well as on metastasis. Staging is used for planning treatment (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Serum ALP levels are frequently elevated with osteogenic sarcoma or bone metastasis. Hypercalcemia is also present with bone metastases from breast, lung, or kidney cancer. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1147" title="1147"></span>Symptoms of hypercalcemia include muscle weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Hypercalcemia must be identified and treated promptly.</p>
<p class="indent">During the diagnostic period, the nurse explains the diagnostic tests and provides psychological and emotional support to the patient and family. The nurse assesses coping behaviors and encourages the use of support systems. Because the terminology associated with benign and malignant growths sound similar, the nurse can clarify the meaning of these in terms of treatment and prognosis and may allay fears.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1500">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Primary Bone Tumors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of primary bone tumor treatment is to destroy or remove the tumor rapidly. This may be accomplished by surgical excision, radiation therapy if the tumor is radiosensitive, and chemotherapy for possible micrometastases. Survival and quality of life are important considerations in procedures that attempt to save the involved extremity; however, surgical removal of the tumor may require amputation of the affected extremity, with the amputation extending well above the tumor to achieve local control of the primary lesion (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If possible, limb-sparing (salvage) procedures are used to remove the tumor and adjacent tissue. A customized prosthesis, total joint arthroplasty, or bone tissue from the patient (autograft) or from a cadaver donor (allograft) replaces the resected tissue. Soft tissue and blood vessels may need grafting because of the extent of the excision. Complications may include infection, loosening or dislocation of the prosthesis, allograft nonunion, fracture, devitalization of the skin and soft tissues, joint fibrosis, and recurrence of the tumor.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the danger of metastasis with malignant bone tumors, chemotherapy is started before and continued after surgery in an effort to eradicate micrometastatic lesions. The goal of combined chemotherapy is greater therapeutic effect at a lower toxicity rate with reduced resistance to the medications. Soft tissue sarcomas are treated with radiation, limb-sparing excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Secondary Bone Tumors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment of advanced metastatic bone cancer is palliative. The therapeutic goal is to relieve the patient&#x2019;s pain and discomfort while promoting quality of life. If the bone is weakened, structural support and stabilization are needed to prevent pathologic fracture. Bones are strengthened by prophylactic internal fixation, arthroplasty, or PMMA (bone cement) reconstruction. Patients with metastatic disease are at higher risk than other patients for postoperative pulmonary congestion, hypoxemia, VTE, and hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="indent">Hematopoiesis is frequently disrupted by tumor invasion of the bone marrow or by treatment (chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation). Blood component therapy restores hematologic factors. Additional therapies may be used to treat the original cancer. Radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy may also be effective in promoting healing of osteolytic lesions (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Bisphosphonates are effective in stabilizing bone and may prevent cancer spread, as are the RANKL drugs (see <a href="c36-sec06.xhtml#tt36-1">Table 36-1</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1501">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse asks the patient about the onset and course of symptoms. During the interview, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding of the disease process, how the patient and the family have been coping, and how the patient has managed the pain. Palpation of the mass is limited to decrease any potential seeding process. The mass size and associated soft tissue swelling, pain, and tenderness are noted. Assessment of the neurovascular status and range of motion of the extremity provides baseline data for future comparisons. Evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s mobility and ability to perform ADLs is also documented.</p>
<p class="indent">The nursing care of a patient who has undergone excision of a bone tumor is similar to that of other patients who have had skeletal surgery. Explanation of diagnostic tests, treatments (e.g., wound care), and expected results (e.g., decreased range of motion, numbness, change of body contours) helps the patient deal with the procedures and changes and adhere to the therapeutic regimen. The nurse can most effectively reinforce and clarify information provided by the surgeon by being present during these discussions.</p>
<p class="indent">Pain can result from multiple factors. Oncology-associated bone pain is recognized as difficult to control. Pain must be assessed accurately and managed with adequate interventions. External-beam radiation to involved metastatic sites may be used. Patients with multiple bony metastases may achieve pain control with systemically given &#x201C;bone-seeking&#x201D; isotopes (e.g., strontium 89). (See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for more information about pain management.)</p>
<p class="indent">Bone tumors weaken the bone to a point at which normal activities or even position changes can result in fracture. During nursing care, the affected extremities must be supported and handled gently. External supports (e.g., splints) may be used for additional protection. Surgery (e.g., open reduction with internal fixation, joint replacement) may be done in an attempt to prevent pathologic fracture. Prescribed weight-bearing restrictions must be followed. The nurse and physical therapist must educate the patient about using assistive devices safely and strengthening unaffected extremities.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse encourages the patient and family to verbalize their fears, concerns, and feelings. They need to be supported as they deal with the impact of the malignant bone tumor. Referral to a psychiatric advanced practice nurse, psychologist, counselor, or spiritual advisor may be indicated for specific psychological help and emotional support.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="h7">Delayed Wound Healing</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wound healing may be delayed because of tissue trauma from surgery, previous radiation therapy, inadequate nutrition, or infection. The nurse minimizes pressure on the wound site to promote circulation to the tissues. An aseptic, nontraumatic wound dressing promotes healing. Monitoring and reporting of laboratory findings facilitate initiation of interventions to promote homeostasis and wound healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Repositioning the patient at frequent intervals reduces the incidence of skin breakdown and pressure injuries. Special therapeutic beds or mattresses may be needed to prevent skin breakdown and to promote wound healing after extensive surgical reconstruction and skin grafting.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1147</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1148" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1148">p. 1148</span></div>
<p class="indent">Inadequate nutrition impairs healing as well. Antiemetic agents and relaxation techniques reduce the adverse GI effects of chemotherapy. Stomatitis is controlled with anesthetic or antifungal mouthwash (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Adequate hydration is essential. Nutritional supplements or parenteral nutrition may be prescribed to achieve adequate nutrition.</p>
<p class="h7">Osteomyelitis and Wound Infections</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prophylactic antibiotics and strict aseptic dressing techniques are used to diminish the occurrence of osteomyelitis and wound infections. During healing, other infections (e.g., upper respiratory infections) need to be prevented so that healing efforts are not divided between the cancer and the new, acute process. If the patient is receiving chemotherapy, the nurse monitors the WBC count and instructs the patient to avoid contact with people who have colds or other infections.</p>
<p class="h7">Hypercalcemia</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hypercalcemia is a dangerous complication of bone cancer or any process involved with breakdown of bone. Symptoms include muscular weakness, incoordination, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, constipation, electrocardiographic changes (e.g., shortened QT interval and ST segment, bradycardia, heart blocks), and altered mental states (e.g., confusion, lethargy, psychotic behavior). Treatment includes hydration with IV administration of normal saline solution, diuresis, mobilization, and medications such as IV bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid). Because inactivity leads to additional loss of bone mass and increased calcium in the blood, the nurse assists the patient to increase activity and ambulation. Denosumab may be prescribed if the calcium levels are not responsive to the IV bisphosphonates (see <a href="c36-sec06.xhtml#tt36-1">Table 36-1</a>). See Chapters 10 and 12 for further discussion of hypercalcemia and its management.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt="icon" /> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preparation for and coordination of continuing health care are begun early as a multidisciplinary effort. Patient education addresses medication, dressing changes, treatment regimens, and the importance of physical and occupational therapy programs. The nurse educates the patient about weight-bearing limitations and special handling to prevent pathologic fractures. The patient and family must be educated about the signs and symptoms of possible complications as well as resources available for continuing care (see <a href="#ct36-13">Chart 36-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Arrangements may be made for home, community-based, or transitional care. A home visit allows the nurse to assess the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s abilities to meet the patient&#x2019;s needs and determine whether other services are needed. The nurse advises the patient to have telephone numbers readily available so that providers can be contacted in case concerns arise.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse emphasizes the need for long-term health monitoring to ensure cure or to detect tumor recurrence or metastasis and the need for recommended health screening. If the patient has metastatic disease, end-of-life issues may need to be explored. Referrals for hospice and palliative care are made if appropriate.</p>
