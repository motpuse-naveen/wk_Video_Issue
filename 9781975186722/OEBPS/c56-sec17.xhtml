<h4 class="h4" id="s2644">Psoriasis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder of the skin that affects approximately 3.2% of Americans (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>). Although the primary manifestation of this noncommunicable disease tends to involve the skin, psoriasis may involve the oral cavity, eyes (including the lids, conjunctivae, and corneas), and joints. Psoriasis is typically characterized by the appearance of silvery plaques that most commonly appear on the skin over the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, and buttocks (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>). Onset may occur at any age, with a median onset at 28 years. It is more prevalent among women and White Americans. It is thought that most patients with psoriasis have a genetic predisposition to develop the disease. Psoriasis is characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation throughout life (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2645">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Current evidence supports an autoimmune basis for psoriasis. Periods of emotional stress and anxiety aggravate the condition, and trauma, infections, and seasonal and hormonal changes may also serve as triggers (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In this disease, the epidermis becomes infiltrated by activated T cells and cytokines, resulting in both vascular engorgement and proliferation of keratinocytes. Epidermal hyperplasia results. These epidermal cells tend to improperly retain their nuclei, crippling their ability to release lipids that encourage cellular adhesion. This results in rapid turnover of poorly matured cells that do not adhere well to each other, resulting in the classic presentation of plaquelike lesions that have a silvery, scaly, and flaky appearance (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2646">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Psoriasis may range in severity from a cosmetic source of annoyance to a physically disabling and disfiguring disorder. Lesions appear as red, raised patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The scaly patches are formed by the buildup of living and dead skin (<a href="#ff56-7">Fig. 56-7</a>). If the scales are scraped away, the dark red base of the lesion is exposed, producing multiple bleeding points. The patches are not moist and may be pruritic. In many cases, the nails are also involved, with pitting, discoloration, crumbling beneath the free edges, and separation of the nail plate (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>). Psoriasis is classified as mild if the plaques involve less than 5% body surface area (BSA), moderate if they involve between 5% and 10% of BSA, and severe if more than 10% BSA is affected by plaque formation (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2647">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Asymmetric rheumatoid factor&#x2014;negative arthritis of multiple joints occurs in up to 42% of people with psoriasis, most typically after the skin lesions appear (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1843" title="1843"></span>The most typical joints affected include those in the hands or feet, although sometimes larger joints such as the elbows, knees, or hips may be affected (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>). A rheumatologist should be consulted to assist in the diagnosis and long-term treatment of this disorder. See <a href="c34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a> for further discussion of spondyloarthropathies, including psoriatic arthritis. Generalized exfoliative dermatitis may also result from psoriasis (see discussion later in this chapter).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2648">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The presence of the classic plaque-type lesions generally confirms the diagnosis of psoriasis. If in doubt, the health care provider should assess for signs of nail and scalp involvement and for a positive family history. Biopsy of the skin is of little diagnostic value. The presence and extent of plaque should be assessed carefully, to calculate BSA involvement.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2649">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of management are to slow the rapid turnover of epidermis, to promote resolution of the psoriatic lesions, and to control the natural cycles of the disease. There is no known cure.</p>
<p class="indent">The therapeutic approach should be one that the patient understands; it should be cosmetically acceptable and minimally disruptive of lifestyle. Treatment involves the commitment of time and effort by the patient and possibly the family. Any precipitating or aggravating factors are addressed. An assessment is made of lifestyle because psoriasis is significantly affected by stress. Management of emotional factors should be addressed as part of the overall treatment of psoriasis. The patient is informed that treatment of severe psoriasis can be time-consuming, expensive, and aesthetically unappealing at times. Many patients report difficulty adhering to treatment plans, either for time reasons or lack of response to the treatment (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Feldman, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Gentle removal of scales is an important principle of psoriasis treatment. This can be accomplished by taking baths with added oils (e.g., olive oil, mineral oil), colloidal oatmeal preparations, or coal tar preparations. A soft brush may be used to gently scrub the psoriatic plaques. After bathing, the application of emollient creams containing alpha-hydroxy acids or salicylic acid can soften thick scales. The patient and family should be encouraged to establish a regular skin care routine that can be maintained even when the psoriasis is not in an acute stage (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Feldman, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Three types of therapy are commonly indicated: topical, phototherapy, and systemic. Topical agents, possibly in tandem with phototherapy, are recommended for mild disease. Patients with moderate or severe disease should receive topical agents, phototherapy, and systemic treatment (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Topical Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Topically applied agents are used to slow the overactive epidermis. Topical corticosteroids may be applied for their anti-inflammatory effects (see <a href="c56-sec01.xhtml#tt56-3">Table 56-3</a>). Choosing the correct strength of corticosteroid for the involved site and choosing the most effective vehicle base are important aspects of topical treatment. In general, high-potency topical corticosteroids should not be used on the face and intertriginous areas, and their use on other areas should be limited to a 4-week course of twice-daily applications. A 4-week break should be taken before repeating treatment with the high-potency corticosteroids. For long-term therapy, moderate-potency corticosteroids are used. On the face and intertriginous areas, only low-potency corticosteroids are appropriate for long-term use (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Occlusive dressings may be applied to increase the effectiveness of the corticosteroid. Large plastic bags may be used&#x2014;one for the upper body with openings cut for the head and arms and one for the lower body with openings for the legs. Large rolls of tubular plastic can be used to cover the arms and legs. Another option is a vinyl jogging suit. The medication is applied, and the suit is put on over it. The hands can be wrapped in gloves, the feet in plastic bags, and the head in a shower cap. Occlusive dressings should not remain in place longer than 8 hours. The skin should be inspected carefully for the appearance of atrophy, hypopigmentation, striae, and telangiectasias&#x2014;all of which are side effects of corticosteroids.</p>
<p class="indent">When psoriasis involves large areas of the body, topical corticosteroid treatment can be expensive and involve some systemic risk. The more potent corticosteroids, when applied to large areas of the body, have the potential to cause adrenal suppression through percutaneous absorption of the medication. In this event, other treatment modalities (e.g., nonsteroidal topical medications, UV light) may be used instead or in combination to decrease the need for corticosteroids (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment with topical nonsteroidal agents, such as calcipotriene and tazarotene, can suppress <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;epidermopoiesis:&lt;/b&gt; development of epidermal cells">epidermopoiesis</button></strong> (i.e., development of epidermal cells) and cause sloughing of the rapidly growing epidermal cells. Calcipotriene 0.05% is a derivative of vitamin D<sub>2</sub>. It works by decreasing the mitotic turnover of the psoriatic plaques. Its most common side effect is local irritation. The intertriginous areas and face should be avoided when using this medication. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of hypercalcemia. Calcipotriene is available as a cream for use on the body and a solution for the scalp. It is not recommended for use by older adult patients because of their more fragile skin or by pregnant or lactating women (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Feldman, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Tazarotene, a retinoid, causes sloughing of the scales covering psoriatic plaques. As with other retinoids, it causes increased sensitivity to sunlight by loss of the outermost layer of skin, so the patient should be cautioned to use an effective sunscreen and avoid other photosensitizers (e.g., tetracycline, antihistamines). Tazarotene is teratogenic, and the risk of use in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefits. A negative result on a pregnancy test should be obtained before initiating this medication in women of childbearing age, and an effective contraceptive should be continued during treatment. Side effects include burning, erythema, or irritation at the site of application, and worsening of psoriasis (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Feldman, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Intralesional injections of the corticosteroid triamcinolone can be given directly into highly visible or isolated patches of psoriasis that are resistant to other forms of therapy. Care must be taken to ensure that the medication is not injected into normal skin (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1843</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1844" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1844">p. 1844</span></div>
<p class="h7">Phototherapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">For patients who do not respond well to topical treatments, phototherapy using narrow-band ultraviolet-B (UVB) therapy may be effective as a single-therapy modality. However, phototherapy is generally more effective when it is given as ultraviolet-A (UVA) in conjunction with a photosensitizing oral medication (a combination referred to as PUVA). Here, the patient takes a photosensitizing medication (i.e., psoralen) in a standard dose and is subsequently exposed to long-wave UV light as the medication plasma levels peak. It is thought that when psoralen-treated skin is exposed to UVA light, the psoralen binds with DNA and decreases epidermal cellular proliferation. PUVA has been associated with long-term risks of skin cancer, cataracts, and premature aging of the skin (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is usually treated two or three times each week until the psoriasis clears. An interim period of 48 hours between treatments is necessary to allow any burns resulting from PUVA therapy to become evident. After the psoriasis clears, the patient begins a maintenance program. Once little or no disease is active, less potent therapies are used to keep minor flare-ups under control (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Systemic Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Although systemic corticosteroids may cause rapid improvement of psoriasis, the usual risks and the possibility of triggering a severe flare-up on withdrawal limit their use; therefore, they are not indicated for treatment of psoriasis.</p>
<p class="indent">Methotrexate, a systemic cytotoxic agent, is the first-line drug for treating moderate to severe psoriasis (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>). Methotrexate appears to inhibit DNA synthesis in epidermal cells, thereby reducing the turnover time of the psoriatic epidermis. However, the medication can be toxic, especially to the liver, kidneys, and bone marrow. Laboratory studies must be monitored to ensure that the hepatic, hematopoietic, and renal systems are functioning adequately. The patient should avoid drinking alcohol while taking methotrexate because alcohol ingestion increases the possibility of liver damage. The medication is teratogenic and thus should not be given to pregnant women.</p>
<p class="indent">Cyclosporine, a cyclic peptide immunosuppressive agent, may be considered in treatment of severe, therapy-resistant cases of psoriasis. However, its use is limited by side effects such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity and is only indicated for short-term use, generally no longer than 3 to 6 months (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another line of treatments for psoriasis includes a group called <em>biologic agents</em> because of their derivation from immunomodulators and bioengineered proteins (such as antibodies or recombinant cytokines) and their targeted action directly on the T cells. These agents act by inhibiting activation and migration, eliminating the T cells completely, slowing postsecretory cytokines or inducing immune deviation.</p>
<p class="indent">Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x03B1;) and can only be given by IV infusion. Ustekinumab is also a monoclonal antibody that specifically interferes with the effect of interleukins (ILs), particularly IL-12 and IL-23. Etanercept is a fusion protein that binds with soluble TNF-&#x03B1; and blocks its interaction with the cell surface receptors. Alefacept is a fusion protein that inhibits T-cell proliferation. Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody against TNF-&#x03B1;. Secukinumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody and ixekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody; both of these agents neutralize the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A and are administered subcutaneously. All of these biologic agents have significant side effects, making close monitoring essential (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Habashy &#x0026; Robles, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2650">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Psoriasis may cause despair and frustration for the patient; observers may stare, comment, ask embarrassing questions, or even avoid the person. The disease can eventually exhaust the patient&#x2019;s resources, interfere with their job, and negatively affect many aspects of life.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the impact of the disease on the patient and the coping strategies used for conducting normal activities and interactions with family and friends. Many patients need reassurance that the condition is not infectious, not a reflection of poor personal hygiene, and not skin cancer. The nurse can create an environment in which the patient feels comfortable discussing important quality of life issues related to their psychosocial and physical response to this chronic illness.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse explains with sensitivity that although there is no cure for psoriasis and lifetime management is necessary, the condition can usually be controlled. The pathophysiology of psoriasis is reviewed, as are the factors that provoke it&#x2014;irritation or injury to the skin (e.g., cut, abrasion, sunburn), current illness (e.g., pharyngeal streptococcal infection), and emotional stress. It is emphasized that repeated trauma to the skin and an unfavorable environment (e.g., cold) may exacerbate psoriasis. The patient is cautioned about taking any nonprescription medications because some may aggravate mild psoriasis. As well, the patient is advised to seek treatment from the same primary provider for any acute illnesses or chronic conditions to minimize chances of receiving prescriptions that may interfere with each other (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Reviewing and explaining the treatment regimen are essential to ensure adherence to the therapeutic regimen. For example, if the patient has a mild condition confined to localized areas, such as the elbows or knees, application of an emollient to maintain softness and minimize scaling may be all that is required. Most patients need a comprehensive plan of care that ranges from using topical medications and shampoos to more complex and lengthy treatment with systemic medications and photochemotherapy, such as PUVA therapy. Patient education materials that include a description of the therapy and specific guidelines are helpful but cannot replace face-to-face discussions (either in-person or online) of the treatment plan.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid injuring the skin, the patient is advised not to pick at or scratch the affected areas. Measures to prevent dry skin are encouraged because dry skin worsens psoriasis. Too-frequent washing produces more soreness and scaling. Water should be warm, not hot, and the skin should be dried by patting with a towel rather than by rubbing. Emollients have a moisturizing effect, providing an occlusive film on the skin surface so that normal water loss through the skin is halted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1845" title="1845"></span>and allowing the trapped water to hydrate the stratum corneum. A bath oil or emollient cleansing agent can comfort sore and scaling skin. Softening the skin can prevent fissures.</p>
<p class="indent">A therapeutic relationship between health care professionals and the patient with psoriasis includes education and support. Introducing the patient to successful coping strategies used by others with psoriasis and making suggestions for reducing or coping with stressful situations at home, school, and work can facilitate a more positive outlook and acceptance of the chronicity of the disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Printed patient education materials may be provided to reinforce face-to-face discussions about treatment guidelines and other considerations. Patients using topical corticosteroid preparations repeatedly on the face and around the eyes should be aware that cataract development is possible. Strict guidelines for applying these medications should be emphasized, because overuse can result in skin atrophy, striae, and medication resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">PUVA, which is reserved for moderate to severe psoriasis, produces photosensitization. If exposure to the sun is unavoidable, the skin must be protected with sunscreen and clothing. Gray- or green-tinted wraparound sunglasses should be worn to protect the eyes during and after treatment, and ophthalmologic examinations should be performed on a regular basis (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Nicpon, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If indicated, referral may be made to a mental health professional who can help to ease emotional strain and give support. Belonging to a support group may also help patients recognize that they are not alone in experiencing life adjustments in response to a visible, chronic disease. The National Psoriasis Foundation publishes periodic bulletins and reports about new and relevant developments in this condition (see Resources section).</p>
