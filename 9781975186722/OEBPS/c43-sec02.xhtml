<h5 class="h5" id="s1794">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If liver function test results are abnormal, the patient is evaluated for liver disease. In such cases, the health history focuses on previous exposure of the patient to hepatotoxic substances or infectious agents. The patient&#x2019;s occupational, recreational, and travel history may assist in identifying exposure to hepatotoxins (e.g., industrial chemicals, other toxins). The patient&#x2019;s history of alcohol and drug use, including but not limited to the use of intravenous (IV) or injection drugs, provides additional information about exposure to toxins and infectious agents. Many medications (including acetaminophen, ketoconazole, and valproic acid) are responsible for hepatic dysfunction and disease (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). A thorough medication history should address all current and past prescription medications, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal remedies, illicit drugs, and dietary supplements.</p>
<p class="indent">Lifestyle behaviors that increase the risk of exposure to infectious agents are identified. IV or injection drug use, sexual practices, and foreign travel are all potential risk factors for liver disease. The amount and type of alcohol consumed are identified using screening tools (questionnaires) that have been developed for this purpose (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). The amount of alcohol required to produce chronic liver disease varies widely, but men who consume 60 to 80 g/day of alcohol (approximately four glasses of beer, wine, or mixed drinks) and women whose alcohol intake is 40 to 60 g/day are considered at high risk for cirrhosis. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cirrhosis:&lt;/b&gt; a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrotic changes, the formation of dense connective tissue within the liver, subsequent degenerative changes, and loss of functioning cells">Cirrhosis</button></strong> is a chronic liver disorder characterized by fibrotic changes, the formation of dense connective tissue within the liver, subsequent degenerative changes, and loss of functional liver tissue (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Barrett et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Sanyal et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The history also includes an evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s past medical history to identify risk factors for the development of liver disease. Current and past medical conditions, including those of a psychological or psychiatric nature, are identified. The family history includes questions about familial liver disorders that may have their origin in alcohol abuse or gallstone disease, as well as other familial or genetic disorders (see <a href="#ct43-2">Chart 43-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The history also addresses symptoms that suggest liver disease. Symptoms that may have their origin in liver disease but are not specific to hepatic dysfunction include jaundice, malaise, weakness, fatigue, pruritus, abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, weight gain, edema, increasing abdominal girth, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia (passage of bloody stools), easy bruising, changes in mental acuity, personality changes, sleep disturbances, and decreased libido in men and secondary amenorrhea in women.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Hepatic Disorders</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A number of hepatic disorders have an underlying genetic cause. However, other genetic disorders associated with metabolic, gastrointestinal, or bleeding disorders will also impact the function of the liver. Some examples of hepatic disorders caused by genetic abnormalities include:</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Autosomal Dominant:</p>
<p class="Box8BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Alagille syndrome</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1795">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses the patient for physical signs that may occur with liver dysfunction, including the pallor often seen with chronic illness and jaundice. The skin, mucosa, and sclerae are inspected for jaundice, and the extremities are assessed for muscle atrophy, edema, and skin excoriation secondary to scratching. The nurse observes the skin for petechiae or ecchymotic areas (bruises), spider angiomas (see <a href="#ff43-3">Fig. 43-3</a>), and palmar erythema. The male patient is assessed for unilateral or bilateral gynecomastia and testicular atrophy due to hormonal changes. The patient&#x2019;s cognitive status (recall, memory, abstract thinking) and neurologic status are assessed. The nurse observes for general tremor, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;asterixis:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary flapping movements of the hands">asterixis</button></strong> (involuntary flapping movements of the hands), weakness, and slurred speech. These symptoms are discussed later.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><img class="m" src="images/icon23.png" alt=""/> In some conditions, lipids may accumulate in the hepatocytes, resulting in the abnormal condition called <em>fatty liver disease.</em> If unrelated to alcohol, this disease is referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A condition known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a more serious condition within the broad spectrum of NAFLDs and may result in damage, fibrotic changes in the liver, and cirrhosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">NAFLD and NASH are two diseases within the spectrum of fatty liver disease to fibrosis and cirrhosis that are strongly associated with obesity (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Barrett et al., 2019</a>). Some studies suggest that being overweight and drinking too much alcohol can cause severe harm to the liver. People who are overweight and people with obesity who are heavy drinkers have a significantly increased risk of developing and dying of chronic liver disease (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Bellentani, 2017</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff, Maddrey, &#x0026; Reddy, 2018</a>). Studies have also identified that there is an increased risk of liver cancer in people with alcoholic cirrhosis who also have fatty liver<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1369" title="1369"></span> disease, type&#x00A0;2 diabetes, and are overweight or have obesity (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Bellentani, 2017</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). In patients who are overweight, have obesity, or have high alcohol intake, the nurse observes for signs of associated liver dysfunction.</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse assesses for the presence of an abdominal fluid wave (discussed later). The abdomen is palpated to assess liver size and to detect any tenderness over the liver. The liver may be palpable in the right upper quadrant. A palpable liver presents as a firm, sharp ridge with a smooth surface (see Fig.&#x00A0;43-4). The nurse estimates the size of the liver by percussing its upper and lower borders. If the liver is not palpable but tenderness is suspected, tapping the lower right thorax briskly may elicit tenderness. For comparison, the nurse then performs a similar maneuver on the left lower thorax.</p>
<p class="indent">If the liver is palpable, the nurse notes and records its size, its consistency, any tenderness, and whether its outline is regular or irregular. If the liver is enlarged, the degree to which it descends below the right costal margin is recorded to provide some indication of its size. The nurse determines whether the liver&#x2019;s edge is sharp and smooth or blunt and whether the enlarged liver is nodular or smooth. The liver of a patient with cirrhosis is small and hard in late-stage cirrhosis, whereas the liver of a patient with acute hepatitis is soft and the hand easily moves the edge.</p>
<p class="indent">Tenderness of the liver indicates recent acute enlargement with consequent stretching of the liver capsule. The absence of tenderness may imply that the enlargement is of long-standing duration. The liver of a patient with viral hepatitis is tender, whereas that of a patient with alcoholic hepatitis is not. Enlargement of the liver is an abnormal finding that requires evaluation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>).</p>
