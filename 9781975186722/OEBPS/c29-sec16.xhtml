<p class="nonindent">Increased platelet production is the primary mechanism of secondary or reactive <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thrombocytosis:&lt;/b&gt; higher-than-normal platelet count">thrombocytosis</button></strong>, characterized by an elevation in the platelet count. However, these elevations are rarely above 1 million/mm<sup>3</sup>. This is in contrast to essential thrombocytosis which is a chronic myeloproliferative disease (see <a href="c30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a>). In secondary thrombocytosis, platelet function and survival are typically normal; therefore, hemorrhage and thrombosis are rare (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Kaushansky, 2016</a>). A number of disorders are associated with a reactive increase in platelets, including infection, iron deficiency anemia, chronic inflammatory disorders, malignancy, acute hemorrhage, and splenectomy. Treatment is directed at the underlying disorder. When managed successfully, the platelet count often returns to normal.</p>
