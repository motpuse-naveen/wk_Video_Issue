<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps9">Y</span>ou are working in an outpatient clinic that has a high volume of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). You know that nutrition is an important focus for patients with IBD and that a low-residue, high-protein, high-calorie, and high-vitamin diet can help decrease symptoms such as diarrhea and weight loss. You recall several patients in the past few months who have presented with diarrhea and weight loss. For this reason, you report your observations to the nurse manager and suggest a quality improvement project for assessing the nutritional status of patients with IBD.</p>

<p class="UMUNT1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1207" title="1207"></span>QSEN Competency Focus: <span class="black">Quality Improvement</span></p>
<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
<p class="UMTA"><span class="redb">Quality Improvement Definition:</span> Use data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and use improvement methods to design and test changes to continuously improve the quality and safety of health care systems.</p>
