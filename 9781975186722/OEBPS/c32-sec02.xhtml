<h4 class="h4" id="s1291">Emotional and Ethical Concerns</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses in all settings are called on to provide care for patients with HIV infection. In doing so, they encounter not only the physical challenges of this epidemic but also emotional and ethical concerns. The concerns raised by health care professionals involve issues such as fear of infection, responsibility for giving care, values clarification, confidentiality, developmental stages of patients and caregivers, and poor prognostic outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Many patients with HIV infection have engaged in &#x201C;stigmatized&#x201D; behaviors. Because these behaviors challenge some traditional religious and moral values, nurses may feel reluctant to care for these patients. In addition, health care providers may still have fear and anxiety about disease transmission despite education concerning infection control and the low incidence of transmission to health care providers. Nurses are encouraged to examine their personal beliefs and to use the process of values clarification to approach controversial issues (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-10">Chart 1-10</a>). The ANA&#x2019;s Code of Ethics for Nurses (ANA, 2015) provides guidance including the first provision which states, &#x201C;The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person&#x201D; (p. 1).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses are responsible for protecting the patient&#x2019;s right to privacy by safeguarding confidential information. Inadvertent disclosure of confidential patient information may result in personal, financial, and emotional hardships for the patient. The controversy surrounding confidentiality concerns the circumstances in which information may be disclosed to others (see <a href="#ct32-13">Chart 32-13</a>). Health care team members need accurate patient information to conduct assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation of patient care. Failure to disclose HIV status could compromise the quality of patient care. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1035" title="1035"></span>Sexual partners of patients infected with HIV should know about the potential for infection and the need to engage in safer sex practices, as well as the possible need for testing and health care. Nurses are advised to discuss concerns about confidentiality with nurse administrators and to consult professional nursing organizations such as the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care and legal experts in their state to identify the most appropriate course of action.</p>
<div class="box4a">
<p class="Box4pNumber" id="ct32-13"><strong>Chart 32-13 <img class="m" src="images/ethicaldilemma.png" alt=""/> ETHICAL DILEMMA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>What if Maintaining Confidentiality Results in Harm?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You are a nurse employed on a <em>per diem</em> basis for a home health agency. A nursing professor whom you know has received funding to conduct a mixed methods research study on men in your community who are experiencing homelessness and living with being human immune deficiency virus (HIV) positive. She has funds to pay nurses with community health experience to gather data for her study, and you were solicited and received education to serve as one of her nurse data collectors. You are assigned to conduct interviews at a homeless shelter for veterans. Eligible participants must sign an informed consent prior to being interviewed; this informed consent was approved by an institutional review board (IRB) at the nursing professor&#x2019;s university and was also approved by the governance board of the homeless shelter for veterans. One day while you are conducting an interview with T.M., a 28-year-old man with a history of male prostitution and substance use disorder (SUD), he suddenly begins to cry softly and says to you &#x201C;I am sorry&#x2026;. I just feel life is no longer worth living. I need to end things and stop going on like this.&#x201D; After further validating the meaning of his words, you learn that T.M. has made a plan to commit suicide. The informed consent that T.M. has signed contains assurances that his name and any information that he shares will not be divulged to anyone outside of the research team. You are conflicted about whether or not you may share his suicidal intentions with anyone.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">It is standard practice that participants who enroll in research studies are guaranteed confidentiality of their identities. However, T.M. is a particularly vulnerable research participant because he is homeless and HIV positive. Interviewing a participant in a research study who is vulnerable can cause emotional distress that might cause harm. Ideally, this contingency should have been identified by the nursing professor and the IRB, and there should have been additional information in the informed consent that identified a behavioral health professional who could be contacted should participants experience distress. Furthermore, the clause in the informed consent that assured T.M. of the confidential nature of the interview should have specified that this confidentiality would need to be breached if it was determined that participant safety was compromised.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Can the principle of nonmaleficence be considered the preeminent principle that guides your decision regarding next steps?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assume that the informed consent does not make any of the specifications previously noted to protect vulnerable participants. Would you feel obligated to relay these findings to the nursing professor who serves as the principal investigator of the research team? Would you feel obligated to relay these findings to the social worker at the homeless shelter? Now assume that the provisions to protect T.M. were indeed specified in the informed consent. Would that change whether or not you would notify either the nursing professor or the social worker?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be mobilized to be of assistance to you as you navigate your role as a research assistant? What are your legal and ethical obligations? Do you have the right or the responsibility to contact the nursing professor&#x2019;s IRB?</p>

<p class="indent">Education and provision of up-to-date information help to alleviate apprehension and prepare nurses to deliver safe, high-quality patient care. Interdisciplinary meetings allow participants to support one another and provide comprehensive patient care. Staff support groups give nurses an opportunity to solve problems and explore values and feelings about caring for patients with AIDS and their families; they also provide a forum for grieving. Other sources of support include nursing administrators, peers, and spiritual advisors.</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.png" alt=""/> Your patient is a 33-year-old transgender woman who has been diagnosed as HIV infected, stage 2.

What is the evidence about the drug/drug interaction between ART and transitional hormone therapy? What strategies could you identify to promote adherence to ART regimen? What are the consequences of discontinuing ART?</p>

He tells you that he has been experiencing night sweats, late afternoon fevers, cough, and weight loss. Identify this patient&#x2019;s health priorities and state the next steps you will use to meet his identified needs and other health promotion needs.</p>
