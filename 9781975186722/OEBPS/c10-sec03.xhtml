<h4 class="h4" id="s201">Hypervolemia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid volume excess (FVE), or hypervolemia, refers to an expansion of the ECF caused by the abnormal retention of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page237" title="237"></span>water and sodium in approximately the same proportions in which they normally exist in the ECF. It is most often secondary to an increase in the total-body sodium content, which, in turn, leads to an increase in total-body water. This can be referred to as an isotonic accumulation of fluids. Because there is isotonic retention of body substances, the serum sodium concentration remains essentially normal.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s202">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">FVE may be related to simple fluid overload or diminished function of the homeostatic mechanisms responsible for regulating fluid balance. Contributing factors can include heart failure, kidney dysfunction, and cirrhosis of the liver. Another contributing factor is consumption of excessive amounts of table or other sodium salts. Excessive administration of sodium-containing fluids in a patient with impaired regulatory mechanisms may predispose them to a serious FVE as well (Sterns, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s203">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations of FVE result from expansion of the ECF and may include edema, distended jugular veins, and crackles (abnormal lung sounds due to interstitial pulmonary fluid). In patients who are ambulatory, edema is most evident in the ankles; in patients who are supine, edema occurs over the sacrum (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Further discussion of clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings can be found in <a href="c10-sec02.xhtml#tt10-4">Table&#x00A0;10-4</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s204">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Laboratory data useful in diagnosing FVE include BUN and hematocrit levels. In FVE, both of these values may be decreased because of plasma dilution. In chronic kidney disease, both serum osmolality and the sodium level are decreased due to excessive retention of water. The urine sodium level is increased if the kidneys are attempting to excrete excess volume. A chest x-ray may reveal pulmonary congestion in FVE. Hypervolemia occurs when aldosterone is chronically stimulated&#x2014;for example, in conditions such as cirrhosis, heart failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Aldosterone increases both sodium and water reabsorption into the bloodstream from the nephron; therefore, the urine sodium level is normal in these conditions (Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2019; Sterns, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s205">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of FVE is directed at the causes, and if related to excessive administration of sodium-containing fluids, discontinuing the infusion may be all that is needed. Symptomatic treatment consists of administering diuretics and restricting fluids and sodium. Diuretics are medications that reduce sodium and water reabsorption at the nephron and thereby enhance water loss via the kidneys (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Brater &#x0026; Ellison, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Diuretics are prescribed when dietary restriction of sodium alone is insufficient to reduce edema. The choice of diuretic is based on the severity of the hypervolemic state, the degree of impairment of renal function, and the potency of the diuretic. Thiazide diuretics block sodium and water reabsorption into the bloodstream at the distal tubule of the nephron, where 5% to 10% of sodium is normally reabsorbed. This leads to a small amount of sodium and water loss via the urine. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide, can cause a greater loss of both sodium and water because they block sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where 20% to 30% of filtered sodium is normally reabsorbed. Generally, thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, are prescribed for mild to moderate hypervolemia and loop diuretics for severe hypervolemia (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Brater &#x0026; Ellison, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Electrolyte imbalances may result from side effects of diuretics. Hypokalemia can occur with all diuretics except those that inhibit aldosterone. Potassium supplements can be prescribed with diuretics to avoid this complication. Hyperkalemia can occur with diuretics that inhibit aldosterone (e.g., spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic), especially in patients with decreased renal function. Hyponatremia occurs with diuresis due to increased release of ADH secondary to reduction in circulating volume. Decreased magnesium levels occur with administration of loop and thiazide diuretics due to decreased reabsorption and increased excretion of magnesium by the kidney (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Brater &#x0026; Ellison, 2019</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Azotemia (increased nitrogen levels in the blood) can occur with FVE when urea and creatinine are not excreted due to decreased perfusion by the kidneys and decreased excretion of waste, as occurs in renal failure. High uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) can also occur from increased reabsorption and decreased excretion of uric acid by the kidneys.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dialysis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If renal function is so severely impaired that pharmacologic agents cannot act efficiently, other modalities are considered to remove sodium and fluid from the body. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be used to remove nitrogenous wastes and control potassium and acid&#x2013;base balance, and to remove sodium and fluid. Continuous renal replacement therapy may also be required (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a> for a discussion of these treatment modalities).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of FVE usually involves dietary restriction of sodium. An average daily diet not restricted in sodium contains 6 to 15 g of salt, whereas low sodium diets can range from a mild restriction (less than 2000 mg/day) to as little as 250 mg of sodium per day, depending on the patient&#x2019;s needs. A mild sodium-restricted diet allows only light salting of food (about half the usual amount) in cooking and at the table, and no addition of salt to commercially prepared foods that are already seasoned. Foods high in sodium must be avoided. It is the sodium salt (sodium chloride) rather than sodium itself that contributes to edema. Therefore, patients are instructed to read food labels carefully to determine salt content (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Olendzki, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because about half of ingested sodium is in the form of seasoning, seasoning substitutes can play a major role in decreasing sodium intake. Lemon juice, onions, and garlic are excellent substitute flavorings, although some patients prefer salt substitutes. Most salt substitutes contain potassium and must therefore be used cautiously by patients taking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page238" title="238"></span>potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride). These substitutes should not be used in conditions associated with potassium retention, such as advanced kidney disease. Salt substitutes containing ammonium chloride can be harmful to patients with liver damage (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Olendzki, 2017</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In some communities, drinking water may contain too much sodium for a sodium-restricted diet. Depending on its source, water may contain as little as 1 mg or more than 1500 mg of sodium per quart. Patients may need to use distilled water if the local water supply is very high in sodium. Bottled water can have a sodium content that ranges from 0 to 1200 mg/L; therefore, if sodium is restricted, the label must be carefully examined for sodium content before purchasing and drinking bottled water. Also, patients on sodium-restricted diets should be cautioned to avoid water softeners that add sodium to water in exchange for other ions, such as calcium. Protein intake may be increased in patients who are malnourished or who have low serum protein levels in an effort to increase capillary oncotic pressure. Increasing oncotic pressure in the bloodstream will pull fluid out of the tissues into vessels for excretion by the kidneys (Sterns, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s206">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">To assess for FVE, the nurse measures I&#x0026;O at regular intervals to identify excessive fluid retention. The patient is weighed daily, and rapid weight gain is noted. Breath sounds are assessed at regular intervals in at-risk patients, particularly if parenteral fluids are being given. The nurse monitors the degree of edema in the most dependent parts of the body, such as the feet and ankles in ambulatory patients and the sacral region in patients confined to bed. Pitting edema is assessed by pressing a finger into the affected part, creating a pit or indentation that is evaluated on a scale of 1+ (minimal) to 4+ (severe) (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, <a href="c25-sec01.xhtml#ff25-2">Fig.&#x00A0;25-2</a>). Peripheral edema is monitored by measuring the circumference of the extremity with a tape measure marked in millimeters (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>An acute weight gain of 1 kg (2.2 lb) is equivalent to a gain of approximately 1 L of fluid.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Hypervolemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Specific interventions vary with the underlying condition and the degree of FVE. However, most patients require sodium-restricted diets in some form, and adherence to the prescribed diet is encouraged. Patients are instructed to avoid over-the-counter (OTC) medications without first checking with a health care provider, because they may contain sodium (e.g., Alka-Seltzer). If fluid retention persists despite adherence to a prescribed diet, hidden sources of sodium, such as the water supply or use of water softeners, should be considered.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Detecting and Controlling Hypervolemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to detect FVE before the condition becomes severe. Interventions include promoting rest, restricting sodium intake, monitoring parenteral fluid therapy, and administering appropriate medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Regular rest periods may be beneficial, because bed rest favors diuresis of fluid. The mechanism is related to diminished venous pooling and the subsequent increase in effective circulating blood volume and renal perfusion. Sodium and fluid restriction should be instituted as indicated. Because most patients with FVE require diuretics, the patient&#x2019;s response to these agents is monitored. The rate of parenteral fluids and the patient&#x2019;s response to these fluids are also closely monitored (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2018</a>). If dyspnea or orthopnea is present, the patient is placed in a semi-Fowler position to promote lung expansion. The patient is turned and repositioned at regular intervals because edematous tissue is more prone to skin breakdown than normal tissue. Because conditions predisposing to FVE are likely to be chronic, patients are taught to monitor their response to therapy by documenting fluid I&#x0026;O and body weight changes. The importance of adhering to the treatment regimen is emphasized.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Edema</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because edema is a common manifestation of FVE, patients need to recognize its symptoms and understand its importance. The nurse gives special attention to edema when instructing the patient with FVE. Edema can occur as a result of increased capillary fluid pressure, decreased capillary oncotic pressure, or increased interstitial oncotic pressure, causing expansion of the interstitial fluid compartment (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hall, 2016</a>). Edema can be localized (e.g., in the ankle, as in rheumatoid arthritis) or generalized (as in cardiac failure and kidney injury) (Sterns, 2018b). Severe generalized edema is called <em>anasarca.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Edema occurs when there is a change in the capillary membrane, increasing the formation of interstitial fluid or decreasing the removal of interstitial fluid. Sodium retention is a frequent cause of the increased ECF volume. Burns and infection are examples of conditions associated with increased interstitial fluid volume. Obstruction to lymphatic outflow, a plasma albumin level less than 1.5 to 2 g/dL, or a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure contributes to increased interstitial fluid volume. If there is decreased cardiac output as in heart failure, the kidneys sense low perfusion and secrete renin which triggers the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system that increases sodium and water retention (Sterns, 2018b). A thorough medication history is necessary to identify any medications that could cause edema, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), estrogens, corticosteroids, and antihypertensive agents (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ascites is a type of edema in which fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity; it results from heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, and some malignant tumors. The patient commonly reports shortness of breath and a sense of pressure because of pressure on the diaphragm.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of treatment is to preserve or restore the circulating intravascular fluid volume. Thus, in addition to treating the cause of the edema, other treatments may include diuretic therapy, restriction of fluids and sodium, elevation of the extremities, application of anti-embolic stockings, paracentesis (pulling fluid out of the peritoneal cavity using a needle and syringe), dialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy in cases of kidney injury or life-threatening fluid volume overload (Sterns, 2018b).</p>
