<h4 class="h4" id="s2000">Adrenocortical Insufficiency (Addison&#x2019;s Disease)</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Primary adrenal insufficiency, also called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Addison&#x2019;s disease:&lt;/b&gt; chronic adrenocortical insufficiency due to inadequate adrenal cortex function">Addison&#x2019;s disease</button></strong>, is the result of dysfunction of the hypothalamus&#x2013;pituitary gland&#x2013;adrenal gland feedback loop which results in insufficient production of steroids by the adrenal glands (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). Addison&#x2019;s disease is considered rare. In 70% to 90% of cases, the cause is an autoimmune disorder but tuberculosis and histoplasmosis are also associated with destruction of adrenal tissue; therefore, both should be considered in the diagnostic workup. Other causes include surgical removal of both adrenal glands; medications such as rifampin, barbiturates, ketoconazole, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors; and metastatic cancers such as lung, breast, colon, and melanoma (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Zhang &#x0026; Carmichael, 2019</a>). Secondary adrenal insufficiency may result from the sudden cessation of exogenous adrenocortical hormonal therapy, which suppresses the body&#x2019;s normal response to stress and interferes with normal feedback mechanisms. Treatment with daily administration of corticosteroids for 2 to 4 weeks may suppress function of the adrenal cortex; therefore, adrenal insufficiency should be considered in any patient who has been treated with corticosteroids (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Zhang &#x0026; Carmichael, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2001">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The loss of mineralocorticoids leads to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water with increased retention of potassium. This may lead to a deficiency in extracellular fluid causing decreased cardiac output. The loss of glucocorticoids results in hypoglycemia with complaints of muscle weakness, lethargy, and GI symptoms including anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting. In addition, the increase in levels of ACTH results in hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, especially of the knuckles, knees, and skin folds (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with Addison&#x2019;s disease are at risk to develop an <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Addisonian crisis:&lt;/b&gt; acute adrenocortical insufficiency; characterized by hypotension, cyanosis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and signs of shock">Addisonian crisis</button></strong>, a life-threatening complication in which severe hypotension, cyanosis, fever, nausea, vomiting, and signs of shock develop. In addition, the patient may have pallor; complain of headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; and may show signs of confusion and restlessness. Even slight overexertion, exposure to cold, acute infection, or a decrease in salt intake may lead to circulatory collapse, shock, and death, if untreated. The stress of surgery or dehydration resulting from preparation for diagnostic tests or surgery may precipitate an Addisonian or hypotensive crisis because of the inhibited feedback loop.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2002">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although the clinical manifestations presented appear specific, the onset of Addison&#x2019;s disease usually occurs with nonspecific symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory test results. Combined measurements of early-morning serum cortisol and plasma ACTH are performed to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from secondary adrenal insufficiency and from normal adrenal function. Patients with primary insufficiency have a greatly increased plasma ACTH level and a serum cortisol concentration lower than the normal range or in the low-normal range (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Zhang &#x0026; Carmichael, 2019</a>). Other laboratory findings include hypoglycemia (decreased levels of blood glucose), hyponatremia (decreased levels of sodium), hyperkalemia (increased serum potassium concentration), and leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2003">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate treatment is directed toward combating circulatory shock: restoring blood circulation, administering fluids and corticosteroids, monitoring vital signs, and placing the patient in a recumbent position with the legs elevated. Hydrocortisone is administered by IV, followed by 3 to 4 L of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution. Vasopressors may be required if hypotension persists.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotics may be given if infection has precipitated adrenal crisis in a patient with chronic adrenal insufficiency. In addition, the patient is assessed closely to identify other factors, stressors, or illnesses that led to the acute episode.</p>
<p class="indent">Oral intake may be initiated as soon as tolerated. IV fluids are gradually decreased after oral fluid intake is adequate to prevent hypovolemia. If the adrenal gland does not regain function, the patient needs lifelong replacement of corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids to prevent recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. Patients who are undergoing stressful procedures, surgery, significant illnesses, or are in the third trimester of pregnancy require additional supplementary therapy with corticosteroid medications to prevent Addisonian crisis. In addition, dietary intake may need to be supplemented with additional salt to manage GI losses of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Zhang &#x0026; Carmichael, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2004">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Patient</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The health history and examination focus on the presence of symptoms of fluid imbalance and the patient&#x2019;s level of stress. The nurse should monitor the blood pressure and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1478" title="1478"></span>pulse rate as the patient moves from a lying, sitting, and standing position to assess for inadequate fluid volume. A decrease in systolic pressure (20 mm Hg or more) may indicate depletion of fluid volume, especially if accompanied by symptoms. The skin should be assessed for changes in color and turgor, which could indicate chronic adrenal insufficiency and hypovolemia. The patient is assessed for change in weight, muscle weakness, fatigue, and any illness or stress that may have precipitated the acute crisis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Addisonian Crisis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient at risk is monitored for signs and symptoms indicative of Addisonian crisis, which can include shock; hypotension; rapid, weak pulse; rapid respiratory rate; pallor; and extreme weakness (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Physical and psychological stressors such as cold exposure, overexertion, infection, and emotional distress should be avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with Addisonian crisis requires immediate treatment with IV administration of fluid, glucose, and electrolytes, especially sodium; replacement of missing steroid hormones; and vasopressors. The nurse anticipates and meets the patient&#x2019;s needs to promote return to a precrisis state.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Restoring Fluid Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse encourages the patient to consume foods and fluids that assist in restoring and maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance which in turn maintains adequate cardiac output. Along with the dietitian, the nurse helps the patient select foods high in sodium during GI disturbances and in very hot weather.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient and family to administer hormone replacement as prescribed and to modify the dosage during illness and other stressful situations. Written and verbal instructions are provided about the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosteroid medications such as hydrocortisone, cortisone, and prednisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone) as prescribed. The patient should be instructed to take prescribed corticosteroids with antacids or meals. The patient should be informed that the steroid therapy usually corrects the mood swings and mental status changes which adrenal insufficiency frequently causes (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Quintanar, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Improving Activity Tolerance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Until the patient&#x2019;s condition is stabilized, the nurse takes precautions to avoid unnecessary activity and stress that could precipitate another hypotensive episode. Efforts are made to detect signs of infection or the presence of other stressors. Explaining the rationale for minimizing stress during the acute crisis assists the patient to increase activity gradually.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the need for lifelong replacement of adrenal cortex hormones to prevent Addisonian crises, the patient and family members receive explicit education about the rationale for replacement therapy and proper dosage. In addition, the patient, family, and caregivers are educated about the signs of excessive or insufficient hormone replacement. Stress can precipitate an Addisonian crisis, and in times of stress the usual dose may need to be adjusted. The patient should have an emergency kit available with syringe and either hydrocortisone or dexamethasone as prescribed by the primary provider (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Zhang &#x0026; Carmichael, 2019</a>). Specific verbal and written instructions about how and when to use the injection are also provided to the patient and family or caregivers. Chart&#x00A0;45-11 summarizes education for patients with Addison&#x2019;s disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Although most patients can return to their job and family responsibilities soon after hospital discharge, others cannot do so because of concurrent illnesses or incomplete recovery from the episode of adrenal insufficiency. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1479" title="1479"></span>In these circumstances, a referral for home, community-based or transitional care enables the nurse to assess the patient&#x2019;s recovery, monitor hormone replacement, and evaluate stress in the home. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s knowledge about medication therapy and dietary modifications and provides education as needed. The home health nurse educates the patient and family on the importance of keeping follow-up visits with the primary provider and participating in health promotion activities and health screening.</p>
