<p class="nonindent">More than 25 million adults in the United States are estimated to have <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urinary incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; unplanned, involuntary, or uncontrolled loss of urine">urinary incontinence</button></strong> (unplanned, involuntary, or uncontrolled loss of urine from the bladder); however, it is difficult to determine exact numbers as there are many <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1612" title="1612"></span>types of urinary incontinence. The prevalence is thought to be 9% to 12% of all adults in the United States, but women are affected twice as often as men (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>). Urinary incontinence is more common in older adults, with rates of between 50% and 90% reported in older adults residing in institutions (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Despite widespread media coverage, urinary incontinence remains underdiagnosed, underreported, and undertreated. Patients may be too embarrassed to seek help, causing them to ignore or conceal symptoms. Many patients use absorbent pads or other devices without having their condition properly diagnosed and appropriately treated. Health care providers must be alert to subtle cues of urinary incontinence and stay informed about current management strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">The costs of care for patients with urinary incontinence include the expenses of absorbent products, medications, and surgical or nonsurgical treatment modalities, as well as psychosocial costs (i.e., embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, and social isolation) (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although urinary incontinence is commonly regarded as a condition that occurs in older multiparous women, it can occur in young nulliparous women, especially during vigorous high-impact activity. Age, gender, and number of vaginal deliveries are established risk factors that explain, in part, the increased incidence in women (see <a href="#ct49-4">Chart&#x00A0;49-4</a>). Men can have urinary incontinence, especially those with certain comorbid conditions. Researchers have reported that 40% of men with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease reported urinary incontinence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">McDonald, Winge, &#x0026; Burn, 2017</a>). Urinary incontinence may be a symptom of other disorders, such as UTI or fecal impaction.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2218">Types of Urinary Incontinence</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are many types of urinary incontinence, including the following:</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stress incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary loss of urine through an intact urethra as a result of exertion, sneezing, coughing, or changing position">Stress incontinence</button></strong> is the involuntary loss of urine through an intact urethra as a result of exertion, sneezing, coughing, or changing position (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>). It predominantly affects women who have had vaginal deliveries and is thought to be the result of decreasing ligament and pelvic floor support of the urethra and decreasing or absent estrogen levels within the urethral walls and bladder base. In men, stress incontinence is often experienced after a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer because of the loss of urethral compression that the prostate had supplied before the surgery, and possibly bladder wall irritability.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urge incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary loss of urine associated with a strong urge to void that cannot be suppressed">Urge incontinence</button></strong> is the involuntary loss of urine associated with a strong urge to void that cannot be suppressed (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>). The patient is aware of the need to void but is unable to reach a toilet in time. An uninhibited detrusor contraction is the precipitating factor. This can occur in a patient with neurologic dysfunction that impairs inhibition of bladder contraction or in a patient without overt neurologic dysfunction.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;functional incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary loss of urine due to physical or cognitive impairment">Functional incontinence</button></strong> is the involuntary loss of urine due to physical or cognitive impairment. This occurs when the lower urinary tract function is intact but other factors, such as severe cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer&#x2019;s dementia), make it difficult for the patient to identify the need to void or physical impairments make it difficult or impossible for the patient to reach the toilet in time for voiding (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Miller, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;iatrogenic incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary loss of urine due to extrinsic medical factors">Iatrogenic incontinence</button></strong> is the involuntary loss of urine due to extrinsic medical factors, predominantly medications. One such example is the use of alpha-adrenergic agents to decrease blood pressure. In some people with an intact urinary system, these agents adversely affect the alpha receptors responsible for bladder neck closing pressure; the bladder neck relaxes to the point of incontinence with a minimal increase in intra-abdominal pressure, thus mimicking stress incontinence. As soon as the medication is discontinued, the apparent incontinence resolves.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;mixed incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary urinary leakage associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing">Mixed incontinence</button></strong><em>,</em> which encompasses several types of urinary incontinence, is involuntary leakage associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Miller, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;overflow incontinence:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary urine loss associated with overdistention of the bladder">Overflow incontinence</button></strong> occurs when there is continual leakage of urine from an overdistended bladder (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>). This can occur because of detrusor muscle underactivity or an outlet obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, pelvic organ prolapse, or tumors, among other things.</p>
<p class="indent">Only with appropriate recognition of the problem, assessment, and referral for diagnostic evaluation and treatment can the outcome of incontinence be determined. All people with incontinence should be considered for evaluation and treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2219"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although urinary incontinence is not a normal consequence of aging, age-related changes in the urinary tract do predispose the older person to incontinence. However, if nurses and other health care providers accept incontinence as an inevitable part of illness or aging or consider it irreversible and untreatable, it cannot be treated successfully. Collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts are essential in assessing and effectively treating urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence can decrease an older person&#x2019;s ability to maintain an independent lifestyle, which increases dependence on caregivers and may lead to institutionalization. Between 35% and 41% of older women have urinary incontinence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1612</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1613" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1613">p. 1613</span></div>
<p class="indent">Many older adults experience transient episodes of incontinence that tend to be abrupt in onset. When this occurs, the nurse should question the patient, as well as the family if possible, about the onset of symptoms and any signs or symptoms of a change in other organ systems. Acute UTI, infection elsewhere in the body, constipation, decreased fluid intake, and a change in a chronic disease pattern, such as elevated blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes or decreased estrogen levels in menopausal women, can provoke the onset of urinary incontinence. If the cause is identified and modified or eliminated early at the onset of incontinence, the incontinence itself may be eliminated. Although the bladder of the older person is more vulnerable to altered detrusor activity, age alone is not a risk factor for urinary incontinence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Miller, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Decreased bladder muscle tone is a normal age-related change found in older adults. This leads to decreased bladder capacity, increased <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;residual urine:&lt;/b&gt; urine that remains in the bladder after voiding">residual urine</button></strong> (urine remaining in the bladder after voiding), and an increase in urgency.</p>
<p class="indent">Many medications affect urinary continence in addition to causing other unwanted or unexpected effects (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Miller, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>). All medications need to be assessed for potential interactions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2220">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Once incontinence is recognized, a thorough history is necessary. This includes a detailed description of the problem and a history of medication use. The patient&#x2019;s voiding history, a diary of fluid intake and output, and bedside tests (e.g., residual urine, stress maneuvers) may be used to help determine the type of urinary incontinence involved. Urodynamic tests may be performed (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>). Urinalysis and urine culture are performed to identify infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Urinary incontinence may be transient or reversible if the underlying cause is successfully treated and the voiding pattern reverts to normal. <a href="#ct49-5">Chart&#x00A0;49-5</a> provides causes of transient incontinence.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2221">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management depends on the type of urinary incontinence and its causes. Management of urinary incontinence may be behavioral, pharmacologic, or surgical.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Behavioral Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Behavioral therapies, also known as nonpharmacologic, or conservative treatments, are the first choice to decrease or eliminate urinary incontinence (see <a href="#ct49-6">Chart&#x00A0;49-6</a>). These are recommended as first-line treatment for nonneurologic causes of incontinence in adults (AUA, 2019b). In using these techniques, health care professionals help patients avoid potential adverse effects of pharmacologic or surgical interventions. Pelvic floor muscle exercises (sometimes referred to as Kegel exercises) represent the cornerstone of behavioral intervention for addressing symptoms of stress, urge, and mixed incontinence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Miller, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>). Other behavioral treatments include the use of a voiding diary, biofeedback, verbal instruction (prompted voiding), and physical therapy (AUA, 2019b; Wooldridge, 2017).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic therapy works best when used as an adjunct to behavioral interventions. The particular antibiotic used will be dependent on the type of incontinence diagnosed (AUA, 2019a). Anticholinergic agents inhibit bladder contraction and are considered first-line medications for urge incontinence (AUA, 2019a; Wooldridge, 2017). Mirabegron, a beta-3 adrenergic agonist, may be used for urge incontinence and overactive bladder but should be used with caution in patients with hypertension as it can cause increased blood pressure (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>). A tricyclic antidepressant medication (e.g., amitriptyline) can also decrease bladder contractions as well as increase bladder neck resistance (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Wooldridge, 2017</a>). Pseudoephedrine sulfate, which acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing urinary retention, may be used to treat stress incontinence; it needs to be used with caution in men with prostatic hyperplasia and in patients with hypertension.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical correction may be indicated in patients who have not achieved continence using behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. Surgical options vary according to the underlying anatomy and the physiologic problem. Most procedures involve lifting and stabilizing the bladder or urethra to restore the normal urethrovesical angle or to lengthen the urethra.</p>
<p class="indent">Women with stress incontinence may undergo an anterior vaginal repair, retropubic suspension, or needle suspension to reposition the urethra. Procedures to compress the urethra and increase resistance to urine flow include sling procedures and placement of periurethral bulking agents such as artificial collagen.</p>
<p class="indent">Periurethral bulking is a minimally invasive procedure in which small amounts of artificial collagen are placed within the walls of the urethra to enhance the closing pressure of the urethra (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>). This procedure takes only 10 to 20 minutes and may be performed under local anesthesia or moderate sedation. A cystoscope is inserted into the urethra. An instrument is inserted through the cystoscope to deliver a small amount of collagen into the urethral wall at locations selected by the urologist. The patient is usually discharged home after voiding. There are no restrictions following the procedure, although multiple sessions may be necessary for a cure (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>). Collagen placement anywhere in the body is considered semipermanent because its durability averages between 12 and 24 months, until the body absorbs the material. Periurethral bulking with collagen is a relatively safe alternative to surgery. It is also an option for people who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1614" title="1614"></span>are seeking help with stress incontinence who prefer to avoid surgery and who do not have access to behavioral therapies.</p>

<div class="box15">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Interventions for Urinary Incontinence</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1First">Behavioral strategies are largely carried out, coordinated, and monitored by the nurse. These interventions may or may not be augmented by the use of medications.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Fluid Management</strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">An adequate daily fluid intake of approximately 1500 to 1600 mL, taken as small increments between breakfast and the evening meal, helps to reduce urinary urgency related to concentrated urine production, decreases the risk of urinary tract infection, and maintains bowel functioning. (Constipation, resulting from inadequate daily fluid intake, can increase urinary urgency and urine retention.) The best fluid is water, although some suggest it may be helpful to include at least one glass of cranberry juice per day. Fluids containing caffeine, carbonation, alcohol, or artificial sweetener should be avoided because they irritate the bladder wall, thus resulting in urinary urgency. Some patients who have heart failure or end-stage kidney disease need to discuss their daily fluid limit with their primary provider.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Standardized Voiding Frequency</strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">After establishing a patient&#x2019;s natural voiding and urinary incontinence tendencies, voiding on a schedule can be very effective in those with and without cognitive impairment, although patients with cognitive impairment may require assistance with this technique from nursing personnel or family members. The object is to purposely empty the bladder before the bladder reaches the critical volume that would cause an urge or stress incontinence episode. This approach involves the following:</p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Timed voiding</strong> involves establishing a set voiding frequency (such as every 2 hours if incontinent episodes tend to occur 2 or more hours after voiding). The individual chooses to &#x201C;void by the clock&#x201D; at the given interval while awake rather than wait until a voiding urge occurs.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Prompted voiding</strong> is timed voiding that is carried out by staff or family members when the individual has cognitive difficulties that make it difficult to remember to void at set intervals. The caregiver checks the patient to assess if they have remained dry and, if so, assists the patient to use the bathroom while providing positive reinforcement for remaining dry.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Habit retraining</strong> is timed voiding at an interval that is more frequent than the individual would usually choose. This technique helps to restore the sensation of the need to void in individuals who are experiencing diminished sensation of bladder filling due to various medical conditions such as a stroke.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Bladder retraining</strong>, also known as &#x201C;bladder drill,&#x201D; incorporates a timed voiding schedule and urinary urge inhibition exercises to inhibit voiding, or leaking urine, in an attempt to remain dry for a set time. When the first timing interval is easily reached on a consistent basis without urinary urgency or incontinence, a new voiding interval, usually 10 to 15 minutes beyond the last, is established. Again, the individual practices urge inhibition exercises to delay voiding or avoid incontinence until the next preset interval arrives. When an acceptable voiding interval is reached, the patient continues that timed voiding sequence throughout the day.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Pelvic Muscle Exercise</strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">Also known as Kegel exercises, pelvic muscle exercise (PME) aims to strengthen the voluntary muscles that assist in bladder and bowel continence in both men and women. Written or verbal instruction alone is usually inadequate to educate an individual about how to identify and strengthen the pelvic floor for sufficient bladder and bowel control. Biofeedback-assisted PME uses either electromyography or manometry to help the individual identify the pelvic muscles as they attempt to learn which muscle group is involved when performing PME. The biofeedback method also allows assessment of the strength of this muscle area.</p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">PME involves gently tightening the same muscles used to stop flatus or the stream of urine for 5- to 10-second increments, followed by 10-second resting phases. To be effective, these exercises need to be performed two or three times a day for at least 6 weeks. Depending on the strength of the pelvic musculature when initially evaluated, anywhere from 10 to 30 repetitions of PME are prescribed at each session. Older patients may need to exercise for an even longer time to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic muscle exercises are helpful for women with stress, urge, or mixed incontinence and for men who have undergone prostate surgery.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Vaginal Cone Retention Exercises</strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">Vaginal cone retention exercises are an adjunct to the Kegel exercises. Vaginal cones of varying weight are inserted intravaginally twice a day. The patient tries to retain the cone for 15 minutes by contracting the pelvic muscles.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Transvaginal or Transrectal Electrical Stimulation</strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">Commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, electrical stimulation is known to elicit a passive contraction of the pelvic floor musculature, thus re-educating these muscles to provide enhanced levels of continence. This modality is often used with biofeedback-assisted pelvic muscle exercise training and voiding schedules. At high frequencies, it is effective for stress incontinence. At low frequencies, electrical stimulation can also relieve symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. Intermediate ranges are used for mixed incontinence.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Neuromodulation</strong></p>
<p class="Box12BL1Middle">Neuromodulation via transvaginal or transrectal nerve stimulation of the pelvic floor inhibits detrusor overactivity and hypersensory bladder signals and strengthens weak sphincter muscles.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Adapted from Hickey, J. V., &#x0026; Strayer, A. L. (2020). <em>The clinical practice of neurological and neurosurgical nursing</em> (8th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">An artificial urinary sphincter can be used to close the urethra and promote continence. Two types of artificial sphincters are a periurethral cuff and a cuff inflation pump.</p>
<p class="indent">Men with overflow and stress incontinence may undergo a transurethral resection to relieve symptoms of prostatic enlargement. An artificial sphincter can be used after prostatic surgery for sphincter incompetence (see <a href="#ff49-2">Fig.&#x00A0;49-2</a>). After surgery, periurethral bulking agents can be injected into the periurethral area to increase compression of the urethra.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2222">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse may encounter the patient with incontinence either in the hospital or as an outpatient. Nursing management of the patient with urinary incontinence in any setting is based on the premise that incontinence is not inevitable with illness <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1615" title="1615"></span>or aging and that it is often reversible and treatable. Patients who are incontinent and hospitalized need routine skin assessment to distinguish between incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) and pressure injury (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Francis, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3601">Qiang, Xian, Bin, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). When either IAD or pressure injury are identified, appropriate management techniques must be implemented to avoid complications (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Francis, 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3601">Qiang et al., 2020</a>).

<p class="indent">The nursing interventions in the outpatient setting are determined in part by the type of treatment that is undertaken. For behavioral therapy to be effective, the nurse must provide support and encouragement, because it is easy for the patient to become discouraged if therapy does not quickly improve the level of continence. Patient education is important and should be provided verbally and in writing (see <a href="#ct49-8">Chart&#x00A0;49-8</a>). The patient should be educated to develop and use a log or diary to record timing of pelvic floor muscle exercises, frequency of voiding, any changes in bladder function, and any episodes of incontinence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Miller, 2019</a>).</p>

A convenience sample of 508 nurses who had been working in an ICU in China with at least 1 year of experience were asked to fill out an online version of the questionnaire which resulted in 500 useable surveys.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The mean score on the knowledge of IAD was 7 out of a possible 11, indicating the need to educate nurses on their knowledge of IAD. The mean score on the attitude toward prevention of IAD was 23 out of a possible 28. The lowest scores on this portion of the questionnaire were in the section about conducting quality control and monitoring of IAD that indicated the need to have a quality improvement program that recorded and followed rates of IAD. The mean score on prevention behaviors was 43 out of a possible 59, indicating the need for more education about daily behaviors such as assessment. Experience was the main influence on knowledge, attitude, and preventive behaviors, as nurses with the most years of experience scored highest.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study provided information about the knowledge, attitude, and preventive behaviors associated with IAD. Nurses have a positive attitude but lack the knowledge and protocols needed to help prevent IAD. This study provides evidence for the need for educational programs and the implementation of standardized quality control and monitoring protocols.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong><strong>Strategies for Promoting Urinary Continence</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet).</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid taking diuretic agents after 4 <small>PM.</small></p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Increase awareness of the amount and timing of all fluid intake.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perform all pelvic floor muscle exercises as prescribed, every day.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Stop smoking (smokers usually cough frequently, which increases incontinence).</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take steps to avoid constipation: Drink adequate fluids, eat a well-balanced diet high in fiber, exercise regularly, and take stool softeners if recommended.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Void regularly, five to eight times a day (about every 2 to 3&#x00A0;hours):</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>First thing in the morning</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before each meal</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before retiring to bed</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Once during the night if necessary</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If pharmacologic treatment is used, the patient and family are educated about its purpose. Patients with mixed incontinence must be informed that anticholinergic and antispasmodic agents can help decrease urinary urgency and frequency and urge incontinence but do not decrease the urinary incontinence related to stress incontinence. If surgical correction is undertaken, the procedure and its desired outcomes are described to the patient and family. Follow-up contact with the patient enables the nurse to answer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1616" title="1616"></span>the patient&#x2019;s questions and to provide reinforcement and encouragement.</p>
