<h4 class="h4" id="s833">Coronary Atherosclerosis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The most common cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;atherosclerosis:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal accumulation of lipid deposits and fibrous tissue within arterial walls and the lumen">atherosclerosis</button></strong>, an abnormal accumulation of lipid, or fatty substances, and fibrous tissue in the lining of arterial blood vessel walls. These substances block and narrow the coronary vessels in a way that reduces blood flow to the myocardium. Atherosclerosis involves a repetitious inflammatory response to injury of the artery wall and subsequent alteration in the structural and biochemical properties of the arterial walls. New information that relates to the development of atherosclerosis has increased the understanding of treatment and prevention of this progressive and potentially life-threatening process.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s834">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The inflammatory response involved with the development of atherosclerosis begins with injury to the vascular endothelium and progresses over many years (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). The injury may be initiated by smoking or tobacco use, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other factors. The endothelium undergoes changes and stops producing the normal antithrombotic and vasodilating agents. The presence of inflammation attracts inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. The macrophages ingest lipids, becoming &#x201C;foam cells&#x201D; that transport the lipids into the arterial wall. Some of the lipid is deposited on the arterial wall, forming fatty streaks. Activated macrophages also release biochemical substances that can further damage the endothelium by contributing to the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The oxidized LDL is toxic to the endothelial cells and fuels progression of the atherosclerotic process (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Following the transport of lipid into the arterial wall, smooth muscle cells proliferate and form a fibrous cap over a core filled with lipid and inflammatory infiltrate. These deposits, called <strong>atheromas</strong>, or plaques, protrude into the lumen of the vessel, narrowing it and obstructing blood flow (see <a href="#ff23-1">Fig. 23-1</a>). Plaque may be stable or unstable, depending on the degree of inflammation and thickness of the fibrous cap. If the fibrous cap over the plaque is thick and the lipid pool remains relatively stable, it can resist the stress of blood flow and vessel movement. If the cap is thin and inflammation is ongoing, the lesion becomes what is called <em>vulnerable plaque.</em> At this point, the lipid core may grow, causing the fibrous plaque to rupture. A ruptured plaque attracts platelets and causes thrombus formation. A thrombus may then obstruct blood flow, leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which may result in an acute <strong>myocardial infarction (MI)</strong>. When an MI occurs, a portion of the heart muscle no longer receives blood flow and becomes necrotic.</p>

Smooth muscle cells proliferate within the vessel wall (<strong>C</strong>), contributing to the development of fatty accumulations and atheroma (<strong>D</strong>). As the plaque enlarges, the vessel narrows and blood flow decreases (<strong>E</strong>). The plaque may rupture and a thrombus might form, obstructing blood flow.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">The anatomic structure of the coronary arteries makes them particularly susceptible to atherosclerosis. As <a href="#ff23-2">Figure 23-2</a> shows, the three major coronary arteries have multiple branches. Atherosclerotic lesions most often form where the vessels branch and with turbulent blood flow, suggesting a hemodynamic component is involved in their formation (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). Although heart disease is most often caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, other phenomena may also decrease blood flow to the heart. Examples include vasospasm (sudden constriction or narrowing) of a coronary artery and profound hypotension.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s835">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CAD produces symptoms and complications according to the location and degree of narrowing of the arterial lumen, thrombus formation, and obstruction of blood flow to the myocardium. This impediment to blood flow is usually progressive, causing an inadequate blood supply that deprives the cardiac muscle cells of oxygen needed for their survival. The condition is known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ischemia:&lt;/b&gt; insufficient tissue oxygenation">ischemia</button></strong>. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;angina pectoris:&lt;/b&gt; chest pain brought about by myocardial ischemia">Angina pectoris</button></strong> refers to chest pain that is brought about by myocardial ischemia. Angina pectoris usually is caused by significant coronary atherosclerosis. If the decrease in blood supply is great enough, of long enough duration, or both, irreversible damage and death of myocardial cells may result. Over time, irreversibly damaged myocardium undergoes degeneration and is replaced by scar tissue, causing various degrees of myocardial dysfunction. Significant myocardial damage may result in persistently low cardiac output and heart failure where the heart cannot support the body&#x2019;s needs for blood. A decrease in blood supply from CAD may cause the heart to abruptly stop beating; this is known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sudden cardiac death:&lt;/b&gt; abrupt cessation of effective heart activity">sudden cardiac death</button></strong> (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for further discussion on CPR).</p>
<p class="indent">The most common manifestation of myocardial ischemia is the onset of chest pain. However, the classic epidemiologic study of the people in Framingham, Massachusetts, showed that nearly 15% of men and women who had coronary events, which included unstable angina, MIs, or sudden cardiac death events, were totally asymptomatic prior to the coronary event (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1763">Kannel, 1986</a>). Patients with myocardial ischemia may present to an emergency department (ED) or clinic with a variety of symptoms other than chest pain. Some complain of epigastric distress and pain that radiates to the jaw or left arm. Patients who are older or have a history of diabetes or heart failure may report shortness of breath. Many women have been found to have atypical symptoms, including indigestion, nausea, palpitations, and numbness (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1753">Davis, 2017</a>). Prodromal symptoms may occur (e.g., angina a few hours to days before the acute episode), or a major cardiac event may be the first indication of coronary atherosclerosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s836">Risk Factors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Epidemiologic studies point to several factors that increase the probability that a person will develop heart disease. Major risk factors are listed in <a href="#ct23-1">Chart 23-1</a>. Although many people with CAD have one or more risk factors, some do not have classic risk factors. Elevated <strong>low-density lipoprotein (LDL)</strong>, also known as bad cholesterol, is a well-known risk factor and the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. People at the highest risk for having a cardiac event are those with known CAD or those with diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, or carotid artery disease. The latter diseases are referred to as CAD risk equivalents, because patients with these diseases have the same risk for a cardiac event as patients with CAD. The likelihood of having a cardiac event is also affected by factors, such as age, gender, systolic blood pressure, smoking history, level of total cholesterol, and level of <strong>high-density lipoprotein (HDL)</strong>, also known as good cholesterol. The Framingham Risk Calculator is a tool commonly used to estimate the risk for having a cardiac event within the next 10 years (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy, Stone, Bailey, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). This tool is designed for adults 20 years and older. The calculation is performed using the individual&#x2019;s risk factor data, including age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and need for antihypertensive medication.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, a cluster of metabolic abnormalities known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;metabolic syndrome:&lt;/b&gt; a cluster of metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease">metabolic syndrome</button></strong> has emerged as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). A diagnosis of this syndrome is made when a patient has three of the following five risk factors:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Enlarged waist circumference (greater than 35.4 inches in males, greater than 31.4 inches in females)</span></li>
<li><span>Elevated triglycerides (greater than or equal to 175 mg/dL, or currently on drug treatment for elevated triglycerides)</span></li>
<li><span>Reduced HDL (less than 40 mg/dL in males, less than 50 mg/dL in females, or currently on drug treatment for reduced HDL)</span></li>
<li><span>Hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg on an average of two to three measurements obtained on two to three separate occasions, or currently on antihypertensive drug treatment for a history of hypertension)</span></li></ul>

<p class="BoxpPARAn">A nonmodifiable risk factor is a circumstance over which a person has no control. A modifiable risk factor is one over which a person may exercise control, such as by changing a lifestyle or personal habit or by using medication. A risk factor may operate independently or in tandem with other risk factors. The more risk factors a person has, the greater the likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). Those at risk are advised to seek regular medical examinations and to engage in heart-healthy behavior (a deliberate effort to reduce the number and extent of risks).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nonmodifiable Risk Factors</strong></p>

<p class="indent">Many people with type 2 diabetes fit this clinical picture. Theories suggest that in patients with obesity, excessive adipose tissue may secrete mediators that lead to metabolic changes. Adipokines (adipose tissue cytokines), free fatty acids, and other substances are known to modify insulin action and contribute to atherogenic changes in the cardiovascular system (see <a href="#ff23-3">Fig. 23-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">C-reactive protein (CRP) is known to be an inflammatory marker for cardiovascular risk, including acute coronary events and stroke. The liver produces CRP in response to a stimulus such as tissue injury, and high levels of this protein may occur in people with diabetes and those who are likely to have an acute coronary event (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). To determine overall cardiovascular risk, clinicians may view high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test results together with other screening tools such as measurements of lipid levels.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s837">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Four modifiable risk factors&#x2014;cholesterol abnormalities, tobacco use, hypertension, and diabetes&#x2014;are established risk factors for CAD and its complications. As a result, they receive much attention in health promotion programs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Controlling Cholesterol Abnormalities</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The association of a high blood cholesterol level with heart disease is well established, and the metabolism of fats is known to be an important contributor to the development of heart disease. Fats, which are insoluble in water, are encased in water-soluble lipoproteins that allow them to be transported within the circulatory system. The various lipoproteins are categorized by their protein content, which is measured in density. The density increases when more protein is present. Four elements of fat metabolism&#x2014;total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides&#x2014;are known to affect the development of heart disease. Cholesterol is processed by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into lipoprotein globules called <em>chylomicrons.</em> These are reprocessed by the liver as lipoproteins (see <a href="#ff23-4">Fig. 23-4</a>). This is a physiologic process necessary for the formation of lipoprotein-based cell membranes and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page729" title="729"></span>other important metabolic processes. When an excess of LDL is produced, LDL particles adhere to receptors in the arterial endothelium. Here, macrophages ingest them, contributing to plaque formation.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff23-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff23-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff23-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;23-4 &#x2022;</span> Lipoproteins and the development of atherosclerosis. As dietary cholesterol and saturated fat are processed by the gastrointestinal tract, chylomicrons enter the blood. They are broken down into chylomicron remnants in the capillaries. The liver processes them into lipoproteins. When these are released into the circulation, excess low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) adhere to receptors on the intimal wall. Macrophages also ingest LDLs and transport them into the vessel wall, beginning the process of plaque formation. HDLs, high-density lipoproteins; VLDLs, very&#x2013;low-density lipoproteins.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have developed clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). These guidelines address primary prevention (preventing the occurrence of CAD) and secondary prevention (preventing the progression of CAD). All adults 20 years and older should have a fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) performed at least once every 5 years, and more often if the profile is abnormal. Patients who have had an acute event (e.g., MI), a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) require assessment of their LDL cholesterol level within a few months of the event or procedure, because LDL levels may be low immediately after the acute event or procedure. Subsequently, lipids should be monitored every 4 to 12 weeks until the desired level is achieved and then every 3 to 12 months as needed (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). A fasting lipid profile should demonstrate the following values (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1780">Stone, Robinson, Lichtenstein, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL (less than 70 mg/dL for very high risk patients)</span></li>
<li><span>Total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dL</span></li>
<li><span>HDL cholesterol greater than 40 mg/dL for males and greater than 50 mg/dL for females</span></li>
<li><span>Triglyceride less than 150 mg/dL</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">LDL is the target of current therapy because of its strong association with advancing CAD. The total cholesterol level <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page730" title="730"></span>is also a clear predictor of coronary events. HDL is known as good cholesterol because it transports other lipoproteins such as LDL to the liver, where they can be degraded and excreted. Because of this, a high HDL level is a strong negative risk factor for heart disease (i.e., it protects against heart disease).</p>
<p class="indent">Triglyceride is made up of fatty acids and is transported through the blood by a lipoprotein. Although an elevated triglyceride level (more than 200 mg/dL) may be genetic in origin, it also can be caused by obesity, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol intake, high-carbohydrate diets, diabetes, kidney disease, and certain medications, such as oral contraceptives and corticosteroids.</p>
<p class="CMA1"><img class="m" src="images/xxvi-3.png" alt=""/>&#x00A0;<em>Concept Mastery Alert</em></p>
<div class="concept">
<p class="concepttxt">It is important to remember the different types of cholesterol and the role of each as a risk factor for heart disease. HDL is the &#x201C;good cholesterol,&#x201D; and higher levels are better; LDL is the &#x201C;bad cholesterol,&#x201D; and lower levels are better.</p>
</div>
<p class="h7">Dietary Measures</p>
<p class="nonindent">Adults who need to lower LDL (and blood pressure) should consider the AHA&#x2019;s diet recommendations or the Mediterranean diet, which are reported to reduce mortality from cardiovascular disease (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1757">Franquesa, Pujol-Busquets, Garc&#x00ED;a-Fern&#x00E1;ndez, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Both eating plans provide similar key elements: an emphasis on plant foods (fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads or other forms of cereals, beans, nuts, and seeds), minimally processed foods, seasonally fresh foods, inclusion of fish, and minimal intake of red meat. Individuals needing to lower LDL and blood pressure should also limit the intake of sweets and sugar sweetened beverages (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1749">Arnett et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Adopting a strict vegetarian diet can significantly reduce blood lipids, blood glucose, body mass index, and blood pressure; however, this type of intensive dietary program may not be acceptable to all patients who need to modify risk factors. Referral to a dietitian can help patients in following a diet that is appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">Many resources are available to assist people in controlling their cholesterol levels. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and its National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), the AHA, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), as well as CAD support groups and reliable Internet sources, are a few examples of the available resources (see Resources section at the end of this chapter). Cookbooks and recipes that include the nutritional contents of foods can be included as resources for patients. Dietary control has been made easier because food manufacturers are required to provide nutritional data on product labels. The label information of interest to a person attempting to eat a heart-healthy diet is as follows: serving size (expressed in household measures), amount of total fat per serving, amount of saturated fat and trans fat per serving, amount of cholesterol per serving, and amount of fiber per serving.</p>
<p class="h7">Physical Activity</p>
<p class="nonindent">Management of an elevated triglyceride level focuses on weight reduction and increased physical activity. Regular, moderate physical activity increases HDL levels and reduces triglyceride levels, decreasing the incidence of coronary events and reducing overall mortality risk. The goal for most adults is to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity of at least 150 minutes per week or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity of at least 75 minutes per week, or an equivalent combination (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1749">Arnett et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). In addition, adults should engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days each week that work all major muscle groups. The nurse helps the patient to set realistic goals for physical activity. For example, inactive patients can start with activity that lasts 3 minutes, such as parking farther from a building to increase daily walking time. Patients should be instructed to engage in an activity or variety of activities that interest them to maintain motivation. They should also be taught to exercise to an intensity that does not preclude their ability to talk; if they cannot have a conversation while exercising, they should slow down or switch to a less intensive activity. When the weather is hot and humid, patients should exercise during the early morning, or indoors, and wear loose-fitting clothing. When the weather is cold, they should layer clothing and wear a hat. Patients should stop any activity if chest pain, unexpected shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea occurs.</p>
<p class="h7">Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">If diet&#x00A0;alone cannot normalize serum cholesterol levels, medications can have a synergistic effect with the prescribed diet and control cholesterol levels (see <a href="#tt23-1">Table 23-1</a>). Lipid-lowering medications can reduce CAD mortality in patients with elevated lipid levels and in at-risk patients with normal lipid levels (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The various types of lipid-lowering agents affect the lipid components somewhat differently; these types include 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) (or statins), fibric acids (or fibrates), bile acid sequestrants (or resins), cholesterol absorption inhibitors, and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) agents. Because of their high cost, PCSK9 agents are prescribed on a limited basis, but may be considered for those at high cardiovascular risk or who have familial hypercholesterolemia (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Before starting statin therapy, the provider and patient should discuss risk factors, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, benefits of risk-reduction, the potential of adverse effects and drug&#x2013;drug interactions, as well as patient preferences for an individualized treatment plan (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1760">Grundy et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Cessation of Tobacco Use</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tobacco use contributes to the development and severity of CAD in at least three ways:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Nicotinic acid in tobacco triggers the release of catecholamines, which raise the heart rate and blood pressure (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). Nicotinic acid can also cause the coronary arteries to constrict. These effects lead to an increased risk of CAD and sudden cardiac death.</span></li>
<li><span>Tobacco use can increase the oxidation of LDL, damaging the vascular endothelium (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1766">Lee, Ong, Zhou, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). This increases platelet adhesion and leads to a higher probability of thrombus formation.</span></li>
<li><span>Inhalation of smoke increases the blood carbon monoxide level and decreases the supply of oxygen to the myocardium (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2021</a>). Hemoglobin, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page731" title="731"></span>the oxygen-carrying component of blood, combines more readily with carbon monoxide than with oxygen. Myocardial ischemia and reduced contractility can result.</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">A person at increased risk for heart disease is encouraged to stop tobacco use through any means possible: educational programs, counseling, consistent motivation and reinforcement messages, support groups, and medications. Some people have found complementary therapies (e.g., acupuncture, guided imagery, hypnosis) to be helpful. People who stop smoking reduce their risk of heart disease within the first year, and the risk continues to decline as long as they refrain from smoking (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1751">Benjamin, Muntner, Alonso, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of medications such as the nicotine patch, nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum, varenicline, or bupropion may assist with stopping the use of tobacco (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1750">Barua, Rigotti, Benowitz, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Products containing nicotine have some of the same effects as smoking: catecholamine release (increasing heart rate and blood pressure) and increased platelet adhesion. These medications should be used for a short time and at the lowest effective doses.</p>
<p class="indent">Exposure to others&#x2019; smoke (passive or secondhand smoke) increases the risk for CAD by 25% to 30% and for stroke by 20% to 30% (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1751">Benjamin et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Other forms of tobacco use are becoming increasingly common today. Use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars has increased, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Specifically, e-cigarette use, which entails inhalation of a vaporized liquid that includes nicotine, solvents, and flavoring (&#x201C;vaping&#x201D;), has risen significantly in these groups. Use of cigarillos and other mass market cigars, hookahs, and water pipes are also on the rise. Short-term exposure to water pipe smoking is associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate, but long-term effects remain unclear. The cardiovascular risks associated with e-cigarette use are not yet known (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1751">Benjamin et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Hypertension</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure measurements of greater than 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure levels greater than 80 mm Hg. A single reading is not adequate to make a diagnosis. Averaging two or three measurements obtained on two to three different occasions will provide a more accurate measurement (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1783">Whelton, Carey, Aronow, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page732" title="732"></span> The risk of cardiovascular disease increases as blood pressure increases, and current guidelines support treating hypertension with a goal of keeping the blood pressure under 130/80 for all adults (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1783">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Long-standing elevated blood pressure may result in increased stiffness of the vessel walls, leading to vessel injury and a resulting inflammatory response within the intima. Inflammatory mediators then lead to the release of growth-promoting factors that cause vessel hypertrophy and hyperresponsiveness. These changes result in acceleration and aggravation of atherosclerosis. Hypertension also increases the work of the left ventricle, which must pump harder to eject blood into the arteries. Over time, the increased workload causes the heart to enlarge and thicken (i.e., hypertrophy) and may eventually lead to heart failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Early detection of high blood pressure and adherence to a therapeutic regimen can prevent the serious consequences associated with untreated elevated blood pressure, including CAD. Intensive management of hypertension lowers the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, and lowers the risk of death (Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2018; see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a> for a detailed discussion of hypertension).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Controlling Diabetes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetes is known to accelerate the development of heart disease. Hyperglycemia fosters dyslipidemia, increased platelet aggregation, and altered red blood cell function, which can lead to thrombus formation. These metabolic alterations may impair endothelial cell&#x2013;dependent vasodilation and smooth muscle function, promoting the development of atherosclerosis. Treatment with insulin, metformin, and other therapeutic interventions that lower plasma glucose levels can lead to improved endothelial function and patient outcomes. See <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a> for a detailed discussion of diabetes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s838">Gender</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Heart disease has long been recognized as a cause of morbidity and mortality in men, but it has not always been as readily recognized in women. Cardiovascular events in women occur an average of 10 years later in life than they do in men (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Wada, Miyauchi, &#x0026; Daida, 2019</a>). Women tend to have a higher incidence of complications from cardiovascular disease and a higher mortality. In addition, women tend to not recognize the symptoms of CAD as early as men, and they wait longer to report their symptoms and seek medical assistance (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1781">Wada et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The age difference between women and men who were newly diagnosed with CAD was traditionally thought to be related to estrogen. Menopause is now recognized as a milestone in the aging process, during which risk factors tend to accumulate. Cardiovascular disease may be well developed by the time of menopause, and although hormone therapy (HT) (formerly referred to as hormone replacement therapy) for menopausal women was once promoted as preventive therapy for CAD, research does not support HT as an effective means of prevention. HT decreases menopausal symptoms and the risk of osteoporosis-related bone fractures; however, it also has been associated with an increased incidence of CAD, breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Current guidelines do not recommend HT for primary or secondary prevention of CAD (Wada et&#x00A0;al., 2019; see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">In the past, women who possibly had coronary vascular events were less likely than men to be referred for coronary artery diagnostic procedures such as heart catheterization or treatment with invasive interventions (e.g., PCI). However, as a result of better education of health care professionals and the general public, gender differences now have less influence on diagnosis and treatment (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1781">Wada et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
