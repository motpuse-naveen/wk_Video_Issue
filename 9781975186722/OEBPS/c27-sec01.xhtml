<h4 class="h4" id="s1049">Hypertension</h4>
<p class="nonindent">For many years, patients were diagnosed with hypertension if they had chronically elevated SBPs of 140 mm Hg or higher or DBPs of 90 mm Hg or higher. These parameters, which also specified that the diagnosis of hypertension must be based on an average of two or more accurate readings taken one to 4 weeks apart, were endorsed by the <em>Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure</em> (JNC 7) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1995">Chobanian, Bakris, Black, et&#x00A0;al., 2003</a>), as well as the <em>Eighth Joint National Committee</em> (JNC 8) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2003">James, Oparil, Carter, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>), and the <em>American Society of Hypertension</em> (ASH) and the <em>International Society of Hypertension</em> (ISH) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2014">Weber, Schiffrin, White, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). However, these parameters for diagnosing hypertension recently changed to less permissive parameters, and patients with average SBPs that are 130 mm Hg or higher or with average DBPs 80 mm Hg or higher may be diagnosed with hypertension, according to the <em>American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force</em> (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The classification system for hypertension has been further revised by the ACC/AHA (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) to include elevated, stage 1, and stage 2 categories, as displayed in <a href="#tt27-1">Table 27-1</a>. <a href="#tt27-1">Table 27-1</a> compares this classification system to previous JNC 7 and JNC 8 guidelines classification systems, which are no longer followed (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1997">DePalma et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The blood pressure categories emphasize the direct relationship between the SBP and DBP risks of morbidity, all-cause mortality, and specifically, cardiovascular mortality. Of particular note, the ACC/AHA guideline (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) changed the previously labeled <em>prehypertension</em> category to <em>elevated blood pressure</em> category. The rationale for this change in terminology is to highlight the association between any elevated blood pressure and increased cardiovascular risk. The blood pressure readings should use the average of two or more valid, reproducible measurements obtained on more than two occasions, in most instances (see later discussion under Assessment and Diagnostic Findings).</p>
<p class="indent">The prevalence of hypertension among adults in the United States is substantially higher when the definition of the ACC/AHA guideline is used versus the JNC 7 or JNC 8 definition (46% vs. 32%) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). However, since nonpharmacologic treatment (i.e., lifestyle changes) is recommended for most adults whose blood pressures are within the elevated hypertension category, the newer guidelines that define hypertension have resulted in only a small increase in antihypertensive medication prescriptions, overall. Indeed, it has been asserted that the greatest benefit of the ACC/AHA (2017) guideline is its greater emphasis on lifestyle interventions, which include weight loss, healthy diet, physical exercise, reduced sodium intake, increased potassium intake, and decreased alcohol intake (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Ioannidis, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The prevalence of hypertension increases as people age or have other cardiovascular risk factors. Of all adults with hypertension, it is estimated that 35.3% do not know that they have this disorder. Furthermore, approximately 45.4% of people with hypertension do not have their blood pressure under control (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1990">Benjamin, Muntner, Alonso, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The prevalence of hypertension varies by ethnicity and gender, and is estimated at approximately 48.2% among Caucasian men, 41.3% among Caucasian women, 58.6% among African American men, 56% among African American women, 47.4% among Hispanic men, 40.8% among Hispanic women, 46.4% among Asian American men, and 36.4% among Asian American women. The prevalence of hypertension among African Americans is among the highest in the world (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1990">Benjamin et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Moreover, African Americans tend to develop hypertension at younger ages than Caucasian Americans (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2011">Spikes, Higgins, Quyyumi, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). <a href="#ct27-1">Chart 27-1</a> displays risk factors for hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have shown better hypertension control rates in women, in Caucasians than in African Americans and Hispanics, and in older versus younger patients. Additionally, adults of higher socioeconomic status have better control of their blood pressures compared to adults of lower socioeconomic status. Hypertension is most prevalent among adults 75 years of age and older, affecting 80% of men and 85.6% of women (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1990">Benjamin et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Hypertension is categorized as either primary hypertension or secondary hypertension. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;primary hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; high blood pressure with no identifiable cause (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; essential hypertension)">Primary hypertension</button></strong> (also called <em>essential hypertension</em>) is diagnosed when there is no identifiable cause (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Alexander, 2019</a>). Approximately 90% to 95% of adults with hypertension have primary hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;secondary hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; high blood pressure from an identified cause, such as chronic kidney disease">Secondary hypertension</button></strong> is defined as high blood pressure from an identifiable underlying cause. Between 5% and 10% of all adults with hypertension have secondary hypertension. Screening for secondary hypertension is indicated for new-onset, poorly controlled hypertension, in hypertension resistant to treatment with three or more drugs, with hypertension of an abrupt onset, or in patients younger than 30 years of age. In addition, a new diagnosis of hypertension with associated excessive target organ damage, such as cerebral vascular disease, retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, CKD, or peripheral arterial disease, could suggest secondary hypertension. <a href="#ct27-2">Chart 27-2</a> displays some common underlying causes of secondary hypertension.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Blood pressure is the product of cardiac output multiplied by peripheral resistance. Cardiac output is the product of the heart rate multiplied by the stroke volume. Each time the heart contracts, pressure is transferred from the contraction of the myocardium to the blood and then pressure is exerted by the blood as it flows through the blood vessels. Hypertension can result from increases in cardiac output, increases in peripheral resistance (constriction of the blood vessels), or both. Increases in cardiac output are often related to an expansion in vascular volume. Although no precise cause can be identified for most cases of hypertension, it is understood that hypertension is a multifactorial condition. Because hypertension can be a sign, it is most likely to have many causes, just as fever has many causes (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Norris, 2019</a>). For hypertension to occur there must be a change in one or more factors affecting peripheral resistance or cardiac output. In addition, there must also be a problem with the body&#x2019;s control systems that monitor or regulate pressure (<a href="#ff27-1">Fig. 27-1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Hypertension is thought to occur as a result of a complex interaction between behavioral&#x2013;social&#x2013;environmental risks and genetics (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2017">Zilbermint, Gaye, Berthon, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Behavioral&#x2013;social&#x2013;environmental risks may include dietary habits, including limited consumption of vegetables, fiber, fish fats, and potassium, and excessive intake of sodium; obesity; poor physical fitness; and excessive alcohol intake (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although single-gene mutations associated with hypertension have been identified, most types of hypertension are thought to be polygenic (i.e., mutations in more than one gene) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The tendency to develop hypertension can be inherited; however, genetic profiles alone cannot predict who will and will not develop hypertension. The role of genetics in hypertension is complex and not fully understood at the present time.</p>
<p class="indent">To date, over 1000 genetic variants have been identified that may contribute to hypertension; however, collectively they explain only about 6% of the trait variance (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2017">Zilbermint et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Structural and functional changes in the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys contribute to increases in blood pressure that occur with aging. These changes include accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque, fragmentation of arterial elastins, increased collagen deposits, impaired vasodilation, and renal dysfunction. The result of these changes is decreased elasticity or stiffening of the major blood vessels, particularly the aorta, and volume expansion (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1998">Fajemiroye, da Cunha, Saavedra-Rodr&#x00ED;guez, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Hence, both SBP and DBP increase linearly up to the sixth decade of life. At that time, among most adults, DBP gradually decreases while SBP continues to rise. Thus, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;isolated systolic hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; a disorder most commonly seen in the older adult in which the systolic pressure is greater than 140 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure is less than 80 mm Hg">isolated systolic hypertension</button></strong> is the predominant form of hypertension in older people (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Results from randomized controlled studies have demonstrated that lowering blood pressure in older adults with isolated systolic hypertension is effective in reducing the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and death (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1051">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Physical examination may reveal no abnormalities other than elevated blood pressure. People with hypertension may be asymptomatic and remain so for many years. Hypertension is known as the &#x201C;silent killer&#x201D; because it typically has no warning signs or symptoms, and many people do not know they have it. However, when specific signs and symptoms appear, they usually indicate vascular damage, with specific manifestations related to the organs served by the involved vessels. These specific manifestations of pathophysiologic changes in various organs as a consequence of hypertension are referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;target organ damage:&lt;/b&gt; manifestations of pathophysiologic changes in various organs as a consequence of hypertension">target organ damage</button></strong>. Retinal changes such as hemorrhages, exudates (fluid accumulation), arteriolar narrowing, and cotton-wool spots (small infarctions) may occur. In severe hypertension, papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) may be seen (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Coronary artery <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page869" title="869"></span>disease with angina and myocardial infarction (MI) are common consequences of hypertension. LVH occurs in response to the increased workload placed on the ventricle as it contracts against higher systemic pressure. When heart damage is extensive, heart failure follows. Pathologic changes in the kidneys (indicated by increased blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and serum creatinine levels) may manifest as nocturia. Cerebrovascular involvement may lead to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, manifested by alterations in vision or speech, dizziness, weakness, a sudden fall, or transient or permanent hemiplegia (paralysis on one side). Cerebral infarctions account for most of the strokes in patients with hypertension (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1052">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The first step of diagnosis is an accurate blood pressure measurement (see <a href="#ct27-3">Chart 27-3</a> for an overview of appropriate BP measurement equipment, instructions, and interpretation for both the patient and the clinician). It is important to use an average of at least two blood pressure readings on at least two occasions to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension for most patients. The notable exception is when a patient&#x2019;s average BP is greater than or equal to 160/100 mm Hg, confirmed by at least two accurate readings on one occasion (see later discussion) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2006">Muntner, Shimbo, Carey, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Blood pressure measurement within a clinical setting is often not an accurate reading; therefore, home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) or ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) are considered more accurate reflections of the blood pressure status. HBPM and ABPM are used not only to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension in most cases, but also to evaluate whether success has been achieved with treatments, such as lifestyle modifications and prescription medications (see later discussion) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Utilizing HBPM and ABPM measurements have led to recognizing other manifestations of blood pressure. Examples of these alternative manifestations of hypertension include masked hypertension and white coat hypertension. Patients with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;masked hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; blood pressure that is typically suggestive of a diagnosis of hypertension that is paradoxically normal in health care settings">masked hypertension</button></strong> exhibit elevated blood pressure at levels typically consistent with hypertension in settings outside the hospital or clinic, while their blood pressure is seemingly normal in health care settings. In contrast, patients with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;white coat hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; blood pressure that increases to hypertensive readings in health care settings that is paradoxically within the normal ranges in other settings">white coat hypertension</button></strong> have blood pressure readings that would suggest a diagnosis of hypertension when they are in health care settings (e.g., clinics), but are within the normal ranges in other settings. If untreated, the patient with masked hypertension can go on to experience adverse cardiovascular events (e.g., MI, strokes) and mortality. On the other hand, the patient with white coat hypertension may receive treatment that is not warranted (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1996">Cohen, Lotito, Trivedi, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Instructions for the Patient</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid eating, smoking, drinking caffeinated beverages, and physical activity for 30 min before blood pressure (BP) is measured.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Empty bladder.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sit quietly for 5 min before the measurement.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sit comfortably, with back supported, with the forearm supported at heart level on a firm surface, with both feet on the ground; avoid talking while the measurement is being taken.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Instructions for the Practitioner</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Select the size of the cuff based on the size of the patient. (The cuff size should have a bladder width of at least 40% of limb circumference and length 80&#x2013;100% of limb circumference.) Small adult cuffs are 12 cm wide and 22 cm long, average adult cuffs are 16 cm wide and 30 cm long, large adult cuffs are 16 cm wide and 36 cm long, and extra-large adult cuffs are 16 cm wide and 42 cm long. Using a cuff that is too small will give a higher BP measurement, and using a cuff that is too large results in a lower BP measurement compared to one taken with a properly sized cuff.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wrap the cuff firmly around the arm. Center the cuff bladder directly over the brachial artery.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Position the patient&#x2019;s arm at the level of the heart.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If an aneroid sphygmomanometer is used, palpate the systolic pressure before auscultating. This technique helps to detect the presence of an auscultatory gap more readily.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ask the patient to sit quietly while the BP is measured, because the BP can increase when the patient is engaged in conversation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Initially, record BP results of both arms and take subsequent measurements from the arm with the higher BP. Normally, the BP should vary by no more than 5 mm Hg between arms.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take two readings 1&#x2013;2 min apart and use the average of these measurements.</p>

<p class="indent">A thorough health history and physical examination are necessary to ensure successful diagnosis and treatment. The onset of high blood pressure and the patient&#x2019;s health history can be used to determine whether the patient might have primary hypertension or secondary hypertension (see <a href="#ct27-2">Chart 27-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Abnormal findings from the physical examination could suggest either target organ damage or secondary hypertension. The physical examination should include palpation of all peripheral pulses. Absent, weak, or delayed femoral pulses could suggest coarctation of the aorta or severe peripheral vascular disease. The neck should be examined for carotid bruits, distended veins, or an enlarged thyroid gland. The upper abdomen should be auscultated for the presence of a renal artery bruit that could be suggestive of renal artery stenosis. A careful cardiac examination is also needed to evaluate for signs of LVH. LVH signs include displacement of the apex, a sustained and enlarged apical impulse, and the presence of an S<sub>4</sub> cardiac sound (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Occasionally, signs of hypertension can be discovered during a fundoscopic eye examination manifested as hypertensive retinopathy (e.g., retinal hemorrhages, microaneurysms, cotton-wool spots, papilledema); these findings are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk (e.g., stroke). Acute or chronic ocular changes can be the initial finding in asymptomatic patients and typically require a referral to an ophthalmologist. Long-standing, untreated hypertension can cause heart failure, CKD (elevated BUN and creatinine), and increased risk for cerebrovascular disease (e.g., TIAs, strokes) (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory tests are also performed to assess for possible target organ damage and to screen for primary hypertension or secondary hypertension. These typically include urinalysis, blood chemistry (i.e., analysis of sodium, potassium, creatinine, fasting glucose, cholesterol levels), and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. LVH can be assessed by echocardiography. Renal damage may be suggested by elevations in BUN and creatinine levels or by microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Additional studies, such as creatinine clearance, renin level, urine tests, and 24-hour urine protein, may be performed. Optional testing may include uric acid and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1053">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of hypertension treatment is to prevent complications (i.e., target organ damage) and death by maintaining a blood pressure lower than 130/80 mm Hg. Findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that hypertension treatment that effectively achieves the aim of BP control to normal levels is associated with lower mortality and lower rates of CVD (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Brunstrom &#x0026; Carlberg, 2018</a>). The optimal treatment plan is one that is inexpensive, simple, and causes the least possible disruption in the patient&#x2019;s life.</p>
<p class="indent">The ACC/AHA Guidelines (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) have developed a series of recommendations for prevention, treatment, and management of hypertension. In addition, these guidelines specify that a diagnosis of hypertension must be made based on accurate blood pressure measurements (see <a href="#ct27-3">Chart 27-3</a>). As noted previously, an average of at least two blood pressure readings on at least two occasions should be used to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension for most patients. After having the BP measured to screen for hypertension, a patient not previously diagnosed with hypertension and with a normal BP (i.e., SBP less than 120 mm Hg and DBP less than 80 mm Hg) can be advised to have the BP reevaluated in 1 year. A patient without a prior diagnosis of hypertension with an elevated BP (i.e., SBP 120 to 129 mm Hg and DBP less than 80 mm Hg) should be advised to follow up with additional BP readings within 3 to 6 months. A patient with a BP that could be consistent with hypertension; that is, with an SBP greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg or a DBP greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg should follow-up with additional BP readings within 1 month&#x2019;s time to either confirm or rule out the diagnosis (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2006">Muntner et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). So that patients with suspected white coat hypertension or masked hypertension may be accurately diagnosed, blood pressure readings should be based on HBPM or ABPM. Patients not instructed to follow up with additional BP readings to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension are patients with average BP readings greater than or equal to 160/100 mm Hg on one occasion; these patients are diagnosed with hypertension and begin treatment with antihypertensive medications (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2006">Muntner et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">All patients who report lifestyle choices that may put them at risk for hypertension should be counseled to adopt lifestyle changes, as appropriate. These lifestyle changes could include weight loss, dietary changes, physical activity modifications, decreased alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (<a href="#tt27-2">Table 27-2</a>). In particular, the <em>Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension</em> (DASH) diet has been one of the most effective diets in lowering BP; if used in conjunction with weight loss, this diet can lower SBP by 11 to 16 mm Hg (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Campbell, 2017</a>) (<a href="#tt27-3">Table 27-3</a>). In addition to this dietary advice, patients should be counseled to incorporate a low sodium (less than 2 g/day), high potassium (3500 to 5000 mg/day) diet; this dietary combination is more effective than following either a lone low sodium or high potassium diet (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Perez &#x0026; Chang, 2014</a>). A high potassium diet must be avoided in patients with CKD, however.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients suspected to have secondary hypertension must be accurately screened and the disorder that caused the high blood pressure must be properly treated in order to bring the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure into normal parameters (see <a href="#ct27-2">Chart 27-2</a>). The recommended treatment for patients with elevated blood pressure but who are not diagnosed with hypertension is lifestyle changes, not antihypertensive medications, with follow-up in 3 to 6 months, as noted previously, to not only reevaluate the blood pressure but to see if it has responded positively to lifestyle modifications (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The primary provider is advised by the ACC/AHA Guidelines (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) to screen the patient diagnosed with Stage 1 hypertension for risk of having adverse cardiac events (e.g., stroke, MI) within the next 10 years by using the online <em>ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus.</em> This tool is published by the ACC and is free to use (links to this tool are provided in the Resources section at the end of this chapter). This tool screens patients based on factors that include blood pressure readings, age, gender, lipid panel results, use of medications, smoking status, and whether or not they have concomitant diabetes. The risk of having an adverse cardiac event is then determined as low, borderline, or high. Those patients with a score of 10 or higher (consistent with mid-borderline risk) should be prescribed an antihypertensive medication, as should any patient diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension. All patients should be advised to institute relevant lifestyle changes, regardless of stage and use of antihypertensive medications.</p>

<p class="indent">Patients are first prescribed low doses of medication. If blood pressure does not fall to less than 130/80 mm Hg, the dose is increased gradually and additional medications are included as necessary to achieve control.

<p class="nonindent">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Since that time, several risks for both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been posed. Epidemiologic findings from early data in China suggest that having a history of hypertension could be an important risk factor for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as for being hospitalized to manage COVID-19 (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2000">Guo, Huang, Lin, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2010">Sommerstein, Kochen, Messerli, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2013">Vaduganathan, Vardeny, Michel, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2016">Yang, Tan, Zhou, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because it is a virus, the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen must replicate within host cells. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells through the ACE2 cellular surface receptors, which are key to regulating the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system (<a href="#ff27-2">Fig. 27-2</a>). ACE2 converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1&#x2013;7. ACE2 receptors are particularly abundant in type II alveolar cells (also called type II pneumocytes), vascular endothelial cells, and central nervous system tissue cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who take ACE inhibitors or ARBs to manage hypertension tend to have an upregulation of ACE2 receptors (i.e., an increase in numbers of ACE2 receptors). Therefore, it is hypothesized that having an abundance of ACE2 receptors makes individuals with hypertension who take these medications more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection; this hypothesis seems to explain the prevalence of patients with hypertension who also have COVID-19. However, it has also been found that, once infected with SARS-CoV-2, host cells will then downregulate ACE2 receptors, interfering <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page876" title="876"></span>with conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1&#x2013;7 (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2013">Vaduganathan et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Angiotensin II and angiotensin 1&#x2013;7 have opposing effects. While angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, high blood pressure, thrombosis, fibrosis, and inflammation, angiotensin 1&#x2013;7 causes vasodilation, lower blood pressure, antithrombosis, and anti-apoptosis, and has anti-inflammatory effects (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2000">Guo et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Thus, once infected with SARS-CoV-2, patients who take ACE inhibitors or ARBs might have a protective advantage over patients who do not take these medications, as patients who take ACE inhibitors or ARBs theoretically should have more ACE2 receptors (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2010">Sommerstein et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Findings from a retrospective, single center study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, support the hypothesis that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs has a protective effect on patients with hypertension. In particular, patients with COVID-19 and hypertension who took these medications had significantly lower concentrations of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin (i.e., both are measures of inflammation) than patients with COVID-19 and hypertension who did not take these medications. In addition, fewer patients who took ACE inhibitors or ARBs were critically ill, and they had a lower mortality rate (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2016">Yang et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Data to date supports continued use of both ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2000">Guo et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2010">Sommerstein et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2013">Vaduganathan et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The target blood pressure for all adults with hypertension is less than 130/80 mm Hg, regardless of age, including older adults (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). There is a caveat, however, that community-dwelling, ambulatory older adults should be carefully monitored for adverse effects of prescribed antihypertensive medications, which can include falls, orthostatic hypotension, and reduced renal function. The usual adage for older adults commencing antihypertensive medications is to <em>start low and go slow;</em> that is, the medication regimen starts with a low medication dosage that is slowly increased over time as needed. For older adults with multiple comorbidities and limited life expectancy, advanced cognitive impairment, or who have had frequent falls, a less aggressive blood pressure target may be reasonable based on clinical judgment and patient preference (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1997">DePalma et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Nonetheless, the <em>American College of Physicians (ACP)</em> and <em>American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)</em> recommend antihypertensive pharmacologic treatment of patients 60 years and older with a history of having had a stroke or a TIA to target SBP less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2009">Qaseem, Wilt, Rich, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">Nurse-led hypertension management has demonstrated greater rates of blood pressure control than when nurses are not leading these management efforts (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Himmelfarb, Commodore-Mensah, &#x0026; Hill, 2016</a>). In many health care settings, nurses provide the BP assessment, the education, and the counseling while actively engaging the patient to promote adherence to the treatment plan (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2001">Himmelfarb et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Assessment includes BP assessment using the equipment, instructions, and interpretive guidelines displayed in <a href="#ct27-3">Chart 27-3</a>, and reviewing the patient&#x2019;s ambulatory or home blood pressure measurement technique and verifying its accuracy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A complete history is obtained to assess for other cardiovascular risk factors and for signs and symptoms that indicate target organ damage (i.e., whether specific tissues are damaged by the elevated blood pressure). Manifestations of target organ damage may include angina; shortness of breath; alterations in speech, vision, or balance; nosebleeds; headaches; dizziness; or nocturia. The patient&#x2019;s partner may be helpful in identifying whether the patient may be experiencing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), if the patient does not report being diagnosed or treated for OSA.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During the physical examination, the nurse must also pay specific attention to the rate, rhythm, and character of the apical and peripheral pulses to detect the effects of hypertension on the heart and blood vessels. A thorough assessment can yield valuable information about the extent to which the hypertension has affected the body and any other personal, social, or financial factors. For example, a patient&#x2019;s ability to adhere to an antihypertensive medication regimen may be influenced by the patient&#x2019;s financial resources to buy the medication and also by limited health insurance. Findings from research suggest that health beliefs, the presence of depressive symptoms, social support, and the presence of concomitant comorbidities might be associated with adherence to antihypertensive medication prescriptions (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2011">Spikes et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct27-4">Chart 27-4</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Spikes, T., Higgins, M., Quyyumi, A., et&#x00A0;al. (2019). The relationship among health beliefs, depressive symptoms, medication adherence, and social support in African Americans with hypertension. <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing</em>, <em>34</em>(1), 44&#x2013;51.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">African American adults are disproportionately affected by hypertension. Not only is the prevalence of hypertension greater among African Americans than among Americans of other ethnic groups, African Americans tend to become hypertensive at earlier ages. They also tend to be at higher risk of having complications from hypertension earlier in life, including cardiovascular diseases such as strokes and heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Evidence from previous research suggests that many African Americans hold different beliefs about the causes and consequences of hypertension than do patients with hypertension from other ethnic groups. These health beliefs are thought to affect adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. Furthermore, previous research suggests that depressive symptoms and social support may also affect adherence to prescribed medications. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to find associations between hypertension beliefs, depressive symptoms, social support, and medication adherence among African Americans with hypertension.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a cross-sectional study that sampled African Americans with metabolic syndrome and hypertension managed with prescription antihypertensive medications (<em>N</em> = 120). Participants completed a series of surveys, including the medication taking subscale of the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale, three select subscales of the Beliefs related to High Blood Pressure in African Americans Scale, the Beck Depression Index, and the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Social Support Inventory.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants were mostly female (77%), with a mean age of 49.9 (&#x00B1;8.6) y. Slightly more than half of participants (54%) reported another comorbid condition in addition to having hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Approximately 37.5% of participants (<em>n</em> = 45) were deemed nonadherent to their prescribed antihypertensive regimen. Beliefs about high blood pressure, depressive symptoms, and social support were not found to correlate with antihypertensive medication adherence. However, participants with other comorbidities were found to have 2.63 times greater odds of adhering to their prescribed antihypertensive medications.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that African Americans with hypertension may be more likely to adhere to their prescribed therapy if they have other comorbidities. The role of comorbidities among patients with hypertension needs to be further explored to determine how and why it might affect medication adherence. Nurses who manage the care of patients with hypertension should be cognizant that those without comorbidities might be at greater risk for nonadherence than those with multiple concomitant health disorders.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include understanding of the disease process and its treatment, participation in a self-care health management program, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The objective of nursing care for patients with hypertension focuses on lowering and controlling the blood pressure without adverse effects or undue cost. To achieve these goals, the nurse&#x2019;s role is to support and educate the patient about the treatment regimen, including making lifestyle changes, taking medications as prescribed, and scheduling regular follow-up appointments with the patient&#x2019;s primary provider to monitor progress or identify and treat any complications of disease or therapy.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">NCREASING</span> K<span class="small">NOWLEDGE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient needs to understand the disease process and how lifestyle changes and medications can control hypertension. The nurse needs to emphasize the concept of controlling hypertension rather than curing it. The nurse can encourage the patient to consult a dietitian to help develop a plan for improving nutrient intake or for weight loss. Explaining that it takes 2&#x2013;3 mo for the taste buds to adapt to changes in salt intake may help the patient adjust to reduced salt intake and consider herbs and seasonings that add flavor without adding salt. The patient should be advised to limit alcohol intake, and tobacco and nicotine should be avoided because anyone with high blood pressure is already at risk for heart disease, and use of cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars, amplifies this risk.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> E<span class="small">FFECTIVE</span> H<span class="small">EALTH</span> M<span class="small">ANAGEMENT</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Deviating from the therapeutic health management program is a significant problem for people with hypertension and other chronic conditions requiring lifetime management. Blood pressure control is achieved by only 54% of patients (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Rates of blood pressure control are lowest among Mexican American men, at only 39% overall (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2001">Himmelfarb et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Effective health management is more likely, however, when patients actively participate in self-care, including self-monitoring of blood pressure and diet, possibly because patients receive immediate feedback and have a greater sense of control. Nurse-led wellness programs that are tailored to the patients&#x2019; behaviors and eating and exercise practices are more effective than generic programs. Patients with hypertension must make considerable effort to adhere to recommended lifestyle modifications (see <a href="#tt27-2">Table 27-2</a>) and to take regularly prescribed medications. The effort needed to follow the therapeutic plan may seem unreasonable to some, particularly when they have no symptoms without medications but do have side effects with medications. Continued education and encouragement are usually needed to enable patients to formulate an acceptable plan that helps them live with their hypertension and adhere to the treatment plans. Compromises may have to be made about some aspects of therapy to achieve higher-priority goals.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse can assist with behavior change by supporting patients in making small changes with each visit that moves them toward their goals. Another important factor is following up at each visit to see how the patient has progressed with the plans made at the prior visit. If the patient has had difficulty with the plan, the patient and nurse should work together to develop an alternative or modification that the patient believes will be more successful. Support groups for weight control, smoking cessation, and stress reduction may be beneficial for some patients; others can benefit from the support of family and friends. The nurse assists the patient to develop and adhere to an appropriate exercise regimen, because regular activity is a significant factor in reducing blood pressure (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2001">Himmelfarb et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">If asked to participate in a blood pressure screening program, the nurse should ensure that proper blood pressure measurement technique is being used (see <a href="#ct27-3">Chart 27-3</a>), that validated electronic devices are used or, if aneroid sphygmomanometers are used, that they are properly calibrated, and that provision has been made to provide follow-up for any person identified as having an elevated blood pressure level. Adequate time should also be allowed to educate each person screened about what the blood pressure numbers mean. Each person should be given a written record of their blood pressure at the screening.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="yellon">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The therapeutic regimen is the responsibility of the patient in collaboration with the primary provider. The nurse can help the patient achieve blood pressure control through education about managing blood pressure (see earlier discussion), setting goal blood pressures, and providing assistance with social support. Involving family members in education programs enables them to support the patient&#x2019;s efforts to control hypertension. The American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute both provide printed and electronic patient education materials (see Resources section).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Providing written information about the expected effects and side effects of medications is important. When side effects occur, patients need to understand the importance of reporting them and to whom they should be reported. Patients need to be informed that <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rebound hypertension:&lt;/b&gt; blood pressure in a patient with hypertension that is controlled with medication and becomes abnormally high with the abrupt discontinuation of that medication">rebound hypertension</button></strong> can occur. This phenomenon is characterized by a pathologically high blood pressure exhibited by patients who suddenly stop taking prescribed antihypertensive medications. Thus, patients should be advised to have an adequate supply of medication, particularly when traveling and in case of emergencies such as natural disasters. If traveling by airplane, patients should pack the medication in their carry-on luggage. All patients should be informed that some medications, such as beta-blockers, might cause sexual dysfunction and that other medications are available if problems with sexual function or satisfaction occur. The nurse can encourage and educate patients to measure their blood pressure at home. This practice involves patients in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page879" title="879"></span>their own care and emphasizes that failing to take medications may result in an identifiable rise in blood pressure. Patients need to know that blood pressure varies continuously and that the range within which their pressure varies should be monitored.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> <span class="yellon">Gerontologic Considerations.</span> Adherence to the therapeutic program may be more difficult for the older adult. The medication regimen may be difficult to remember, and the expense can be a challenge. Simplification of the medication regimen to treatment with a single antihypertensive medication, if possible, is helpful. Many older adults are taking other prescription and over-the-counter medications, and verifying that there are no medication interactions is important. As noted previously, community-dwelling, ambulatory older adults should be carefully monitored for adverse effects of prescribed antihypertensive medications, which can include falls, orthostatic hypotension, and reduced renal function (e.g., the nurse should assess patient&#x2019;s urinary output and weight for changes from baseline). Special care must be taken to ensure the older patient understands the medication regimen, can see and read the instructions, open the medication container, and can get the prescription refilled. The older adult&#x2019;s family or caregivers should be included in the educational program so that they understand the patient&#x2019;s needs, can encourage adherence to the treatment plan, and know when and whom to call if problems arise or further information is needed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="yellon">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Regular follow-up care is imperative so that blood pressure control can be achieved. A history and physical examination should be completed at each clinic visit. The history should include all data pertaining to any potential problem, specifically medication-related problems such as orthostatic hypotension (experienced as dizziness or lightheadedness on standing). The patient should also bring a home blood pressure log and their own home blood pressure machine to verify accuracy and technique of home blood pressure monitor use. Patients and caregivers should also be given updated information at each visit on blood pressure medication, side effects, and important side effects to report immediately, such as low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension. Low blood pressure readings can be due to impaired cardiovascular reflexes brought on by diuretics and other medication interactions.</p>

The nurse educates patients to change positions slowly when moving from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. The nurse also counsels older adult patients to use supportive devices such as hand rails and walkers as necessary to prevent falls that could result from dizziness.</em></p></div>

<p class="processppara">Target organ damage is a potential adverse effect of long standing or poorly controlled hypertension. When the patient returns for follow-up care, all body systems must be assessed to detect any evidence of vascular damage. An eye examination with an ophthalmoscope is particularly important because retinal blood vessel damage indicates similar damage elsewhere in the vascular system. The patient is questioned about blurred vision, spots in front of the eyes, and diminished visual acuity. The heart, nervous system, and kidneys are also carefully assessed. Any significant findings are promptly reported to determine whether additional diagnostic studies are required.
