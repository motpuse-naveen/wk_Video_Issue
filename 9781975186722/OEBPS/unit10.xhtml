<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps4">Y</span>ou are a certified diabetes care and education specialist in a community hospital. Today you are making a home visit to a 53-year-old Black man to follow up on the results of a 13% HgbA<sub>1c</sub> that was drawn a few weeks ago. He is 5&#x2032;5&#x2032;, weighs 180&#x00A0;lb, his finger stick glucose today is 310&#x00A0;mg/dL, and he lives with his adult daughter. While discussing the associations between an HgbA<sub>1c</sub> and poor blood glucose control, you review the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. During the visit the patient and his daughter state they want to try cinnamon tea and other alternative and complementary therapies to help control his blood glucose naturally. You intend to collaborate with the family&#x2019;s preferences and educate them on the various ways he can maintain glucose control through diet, exercise, and medications.</p>
<p class="UMUNT1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1341" title="1341"></span>QSEN Competency Focus: Patient-Centered Care</p>
<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
<p class="UMTA"><span class="redb">Patient-Centered Care Definition:</span> Recognize the patient or designee as the source of control and full partner in providing compassionate and coordinated care based on respect for patient&#x2019;s preferences, values, and needs.</p>
