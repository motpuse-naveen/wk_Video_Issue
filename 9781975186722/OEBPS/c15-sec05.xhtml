<h4 class="h4" id="s502">Potential Intraoperative Complications</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The surgical patient is subject to several risks. The major potential intraoperative complications include anesthesia awareness, nausea and vomiting, anaphylaxis, hypoxia, hypothermia, and malignant hyperthermia (MH). Targeted areas include SSIs as well as cardiac, respiratory, and venous thromboembolic complications (<a href="#bib1283">Joint Commission, 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s503">Anesthesia Awareness</h3>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to discuss concerns about intraoperative awareness with patients preoperatively so that they realize that only general anesthesia is meant to create a state of oblivion. All other forms of anesthesia will eliminate pain, but sensation of pushing and pulling tissues may still be recognized and they may hear conversations among the operative team. In many cases, patients may be able to respond to questions and involve themselves in the discussion. This is normal and is not what is referred to as anesthesia awareness.</p>
<p class="indent">Unintended intraoperative awareness refers to a patient becoming cognizant of surgical interventions while under general anesthesia and then recalling the incident. Neuromuscular blocks, sometimes required for surgical muscle relaxation, intensify the fear of the patient experiencing awareness because they are then unable to communicate during the episode. Patients may or may not feel pain, and some patients experience a feeling of pressure. It has been estimated that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page431" title="431"></span>roughly 1 patient per 1000 receiving general anesthesia experiences some level of awareness that is most commonly fleeting (AANA, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Indications of the occurrence of anesthesia awareness include an increase in the blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and patient movement. However, hemodynamic changes can be masked by paralytic medication, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, thus the awareness may remain undetected. Premedication with amnesic agents and avoidance of muscle paralytics except when essential help to preclude its occurrence.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s504">Nausea and Vomiting</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Nausea and vomiting, or regurgitation, may affect patients during the intraoperative period. The patient should be assessed preoperatively for risk factors of PONV so that the surgical team can formulate a plan for intraoperative prevention. Risk factors include female gender, age less than 50 years, history of PONV, and opioid administration (<a href="#bib1279">Finch, Parkosewich, Perrone, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If gagging occurs, the patient is turned to the side, the head of the table is lowered, and a basin is provided to collect the vomitus. Suction is used to remove saliva and vomited gastric contents. In some cases, the anesthesiologist or CRNA administers antiemetics preoperatively or intraoperatively to counteract possible aspiration. If the patient aspirates vomitus, an attack with severe bronchial spasms and wheezing is triggered. Pneumonitis and pulmonary edema can subsequently develop, leading to extreme hypoxia. Increasing medical attention is being paid to silent regurgitation of gastric contents (not related to preoperative fasting times), which occurs more frequently than previously realized. The volume and acidity of the aspirate determine the extent of damage to the lungs. Patients may be given citric acid and sodium citrate, a clear, nonparticulate antacid to increase gastric fluid pH or a histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonist such as cimetidine, or famotidine to decrease gastric acid production (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s505">Anaphylaxis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Any time the patient comes into contact with a foreign substance, there is potential for an anaphylactic reaction. An anaphylactic reaction can occur in response to many medications, latex, or other substances. The reaction may be immediate or delayed. Anaphylaxis can be a life-threatening reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Latex allergy&#x2014;the sensitivity to natural rubber latex products&#x2014;has become more prevalent, creating the need for alert responsiveness among health care professionals. If patients state that they have allergies to latex, even if they are wearing latex in their clothing, treatment must be latex free. In the OR, many products are latex free with the notable exception of softer latex catheters. Surgical cases should use latex-free gloves in anticipation of a possible allergy, and if no allergy is present, then personnel can switch to other gloves after the case starts if desired.</p>
<p class="indent">Fibrin sealants are used in various surgical procedures, and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are used to close wounds without the use of sutures. These sealants have been implicated in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Although these reactions are rare, the nurse must be alert to the possibility and observe the patient for changes in vital signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis when these products are used. In the OR, the team should remove potential causative agents promptly&#x2014;within 3 minutes or less&#x2014;of becoming aware of an anaphylactic reaction. The surgical team should be aware of the importance of prompt intervention to prevent cardiovascular and respiratory collapse (<a href="#bib1303">Seifert, 2017</a>). (<a href="c11.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;11</a> and <a href="c33.xhtml">33</a> provide more details about the signs, symptoms, and treatment of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock.)</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s506">Hypoxia and Other Respiratory Complications</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Inadequate ventilation, occlusion of the airway, inadvertent intubation of the esophagus, and hypoxia are significant potential complications associated with general anesthesia. Many factors can contribute to inadequate ventilation. Respiratory depression caused by anesthetic agents, aspiration of respiratory tract secretions or vomitus, and the patient&#x2019;s position on the operating table can compromise the exchange of gases. Anatomic variation can make the trachea difficult to visualize and result in insertion of the artificial airway into the esophagus rather than into the trachea. In addition to these dangers, asphyxia caused by foreign bodies in the mouth; spasm of the vocal cords; relaxation of the tongue; or aspiration of vomitus, saliva, or blood can occur. Brain damage from hypoxia occurs within minutes; therefore, vigilant monitoring of the patient&#x2019;s oxygenation status is a primary function of the anesthesiologist or CRNA and the circulating nurse. Peripheral perfusion is checked frequently, and capnography readings are monitored continuously. Capnography provides instantaneous information about carbon dioxide production, pulmonary perfusion, and respiratory patterns that detect hypoventilation and apnea (<a href="#bib1303">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s507">Hypothermia</h3>
<p class="nonindent">During anesthesia, the patient&#x2019;s temperature may fall. Glucose metabolism is reduced, and as a result, metabolic acidosis may develop. This condition is called <em>hypothermia</em> and is indicated by a core body temperature that is lower than normal (36.6&#x00B0;C [98&#x00B0;F] or less). Risks of intraoperative hypothermia include cardiovascular events, SSIs, bleeding, and delayed arousal from anesthesia (<a href="#bib1292">Williams, 2018</a>). Unintended hypothermia may occur as a result of a low temperature in the OR, infusion of cold fluids, inhalation of cold gases, open body wounds or cavities, decreased muscle activity, advanced age, or the pharmaceutical agents used (e.g., vasodilators, phenothiazines, general anesthetic medications). Hypothermia can depress neuronal activity and decrease cellular oxygen requirements below the minimum levels normally required for continued cell viability. As a result, it is used to protect function during some surgical procedures (e.g., carotid endarterectomy, cardiopulmonary bypass) (<a href="#bib1303">Barash et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Unintended hypothermia needs to be avoided. If it occurs, it must be minimized or reversed. If hypothermia is intentional, the goal is safe return to normal body temperature. Environmental temperature in the OR can temporarily be set at 25&#x00B0; to 26.6&#x00B0;C (78&#x00B0; to 80&#x00B0;F). IV and irrigating fluids are warmed to 37&#x00B0;C (98.6&#x00B0;F). Wet gowns and drapes are removed promptly and replaced with dry materials, because wet materials promote heat loss. Warm air blankets and thermal blankets can also be used on the areas not exposed for surgery, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page432" title="432"></span>minimizing the area of the patient that is exposed will help maintain core temperature. Whatever methods are used to rewarm the patient, warming must be accomplished gradually, not rapidly. Conscientious monitoring of core temperature, urinary output, ECG, blood pressure, arterial blood gas levels, and serum electrolyte levels is required.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s508">Malignant Hyperthermia</h3>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;malignant hyperthermia:&lt;/b&gt; a rare life-threatening condition triggered by exposure to most anesthetic agents inducing a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism that can overwhelm the body&#x2019;s capacity to supply oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate body temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if untreated; often inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder">Malignant hyperthermia</button></strong> is a rare inherited muscle disorder that is chemically induced by anesthetic agents (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). This disorder can be triggered by myopathies, emotional stress, heatstroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, strenuous exercise exertion, and trauma. The incidence rate is 1 in every 170,698 general anesthetic cases (Phi, Carvalho, Sun, et al., 2018). MH occurs because of a genetic autosomal dominant disorder involving a mutation on the ryanodine receptor that causes an atypical increase in release of calcium in muscle cells (<a href="#bib1303">Mullins, 2018</a>). Susceptible people include those with strong and bulky muscles, a history of muscle cramps or muscle weakness and unexplained temperature elevation, and an unexplained death of a family member during surgery that was accompanied by a febrile response (<a href="#bib1282">Ho, Carvalho, Sun, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s509">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During anesthesia, potent agents such as inhalation anesthetic agents (i.e., halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) and muscle relaxants (succinylcholine) may trigger the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Stress and some medications, such as sympathomimetics (epinephrine), theophylline, aminophylline, anticholinergics (atropine), and cardiac glycosides (digitalis), can induce or intensify a reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The pathophysiology of MH is related to a hypermetabolic condition that involves altered mechanisms of calcium function in skeletal muscle cells. This disruption of calcium causes clinical symptoms of hypermetabolism, which in turn increases muscle contraction (rigidity) and causes hyperthermia and subsequent damage to the central nervous system.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s510">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The initial symptoms of MH are often cardiovascular, respiratory, and abnormal musculoskeletal activity. Tachycardia (heart rate greater than 150 bpm) may be an early sign. Sympathetic nervous stimulation also leads to ventricular arrhythmia, hypotension, decreased cardiac output, oliguria, and, later, cardiac arrest. Hypercapnia, an increase in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), may be an early respiratory sign. With the abnormal transport of calcium, rigidity or tetanuslike movements occur, often in the jaw. Generalized muscle rigidity is one of the earliest signs. The rise in temperature is actually a late sign that develops rapidly; body temperature can increase 1&#x00B0; to 2&#x00B0;C (2&#x00B0; to 4&#x00B0;F) every 5 minutes, and core body temperature can exceed 42&#x00B0;C (107&#x00B0;F) (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s511">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Goals of treatment are to decrease metabolism, reverse metabolic and respiratory acidosis, correct arrhythmias, decrease body temperature, provide oxygen and nutrition to tissues, and correct electrolyte imbalance. The treatment for MH is well known. Use of dantrolene has lowered mortality rates to 10% in current practice (<a href="#bib1303">Ho et al., 2018</a>). The Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) publishes a treatment protocol that should be posted in the OR and be readily available on a MH cart (see Resources section).</p>
<p class="indent">Anesthesia and surgery should be postponed. However, if end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring and dantrolene sodium are available and the anesthesiologist is experienced in managing MH, the surgery may continue using a different anesthetic agent (<a href="#bib1303">Barash et al., 2017</a>). Although MH usually manifests about 10 to 20 minutes after induction of anesthesia, it can also occur during the first 24 hours after surgery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s512">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although MH is uncommon, the nurse must identify patients at risk, recognize the signs and symptoms, have the appropriate medication and equipment available, and be knowledgeable about the protocol to follow. Preparation and early intervention may be lifesaving for the patient.</p>

<p class="processppara">Nursing assessment of the intraoperative patient involves obtaining data from the patient and the patient&#x2019;s medical record to identify factors that can affect care. These serve as guidelines for an individualized plan of patient care. The intraoperative nurse uses the focused preoperative nursing assessment documented on the patient record. This includes assessment of physiologic status (e.g., health&#x2013;illness level, level of consciousness), psychosocial status (e.g., anxiety level, verbal communication problems, coping mechanisms), physical status (e.g., surgical site, skin condition, and effectiveness of preparation; mobility of joints), and ethical concerns.</p>

<p class="processppara">The major goals for care of the patient during surgery include reduced anxiety, absence of latex exposure, absence of positioning injuries, freedom from injury, maintenance of the patient&#x2019;s dignity, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Preoperatively, the intraoperative nurse visiting the patient can help decrease anxiety and promote a relationship of communication and trust. The effect of familiarizing patients revealed significant decreased preoperative and postoperative anxiety (<a href="#bib1273">Bagheri, Ebrahimi, Abbasi, et al., 2019</a>). The patient should be notified of what to expect when entering the operating room, and the nurse should inquire about any patient-specific relaxation preferences. The OR environment can seem cold, stark, and frightening to the patient, who may be feeling isolated and apprehensive. Introducing yourself, addressing the patient by name warmly and frequently, verifying details, providing explanations, and encouraging and answering questions provide a sense of professionalism and friendliness that can help the patient feel safe and secure. When discussing what the patient can expect in surgery, the nurse uses basic communication skills, such as touch and eye contact, to reduce anxiety. Attention to physical comfort (warm blankets, padding, position changes) helps the patient feel more comfortable. Telling the patient who else will be present in the OR, how long the procedure is expected to take, and other details helps the patient prepare for the experience and gain a sense of control.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The circulating nurse may assist to decrease anxiety during induction by using techniques such as guided imagery, decreasing room stimuli by dimming the lights, having the patient&#x2019;s favorite music playing, or by talking in a soft voice and using eye contact, if culturally appropriate.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> L<small>ATEX</small> E<small>XPOSURE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients with latex allergies require early identification and communication to all personnel about the presence of the allergy according to standards of care for patients with latex allergy (AORN, 2019a). In most ORs, there are few latex items currently in use, but because there still remain some instances of latex use, maintenance of latex allergy precautions throughout the perioperative period must be observed. For safety, manufacturers and hospital materials managers need to take responsibility for identifying the latex content in items used by patients and health care personnel. (See <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;14</a> and <a href="c33.xhtml">33</a> for assessment for latex allergy.)</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> P<small>ERIOPERATIVE</small> P<small>OSITIONING</small> I<small>NJURY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient&#x2019;s position on the operating table depends on the surgical procedure to be performed as well as the patient&#x2019;s physical condition (see <a href="#ff15-6">Fig.&#x00A0;15-6</a>). One type of injury, peripheral nerve injury, is defined as the interruption of electrical activity that affects either the sensory, motor, or both nerve functions resulting in a deficit. Studies suggest a correlation between total OR time and tissue breakdown (<a href="#bib1280">Grap, Schubert, Munro, et al., 2019</a>). See <a href="#ct15-3">Chart&#x00A0;15-3</a> for a Nursing Research Profile that investigated these occurrences. The potential for transient discomfort or permanent injury is present because many surgical procedures require awkward <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page434" title="434"></span>anatomical positions. Hyperextending joints, compressing arteries, or pressing on nerves and bony prominences usually results in discomfort simply because the position must be sustained for a long period of time (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Factors to consider include the following:</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Sacral Tissue Pressure Injury Prevalence in Surgical Patients</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Grap, M. J., Schubert, C., Munro, C. L., et al. (2019). OR time and sacral pressure injuries in critically ill surgical patients. <em>AORN Journal</em><em>,</em> <em>109</em>(2), 229&#x2013;239.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The ability to identify early changes associated with pressure injury and OR time may enhance pressure injury prevention strategies. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between OR time and sacral pressure injuries in critically ill patients using high-frequency ultrasound (HFU) to identify early tissue changes.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A secondary analysis was used to evaluate the effect of backrest elevation on 150 ventilated patients in the ICU post surgery. All of the patients had recorded OR time and the Braden Score was collected to identify patients at risk for surgical pressure injury.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">One hundred and fifty participants were enrolled and 132 had skin evaluations. The majority of participants were middle-aged White males (58%), overweight, and had a Braden Scale score showing moderate risk for pressure injury. Total OR time ranged from just under 1 hour to more than 13 hours, with an average time of more than 4 hours. For those participants who developed pressure injuries, time between the OR and injury observed was approximately 2 to 3 days on average. Approximately 63% of participants did not have sacral pressure injuries at any point during the observation period. Using multivariable models, the model containing OR bed time, BMI, and Braden Scale score produced the best prediction of pressure injury. A higher BMI, shorter OR bed time, and lower Braden Scale score were associated with a greater chance of pressure injury.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Preventing pressure injuries are a priority for nurses in all setting and is particularly challenging for critical-care patients. These preliminary results demonstrate that the use of HFU may help nurses identify the development of tissue changes before observable skin changes, leading to earlier pressure injury prevention strategies.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The usual position for surgery, called the <em>dorsal recumbent position,</em> is flat on the back. Both arms are positioned at the side of the table: one with the hand placed palm down and the other carefully positioned on an armboard to facilitate IV infusion of fluids, blood, or medications. This position is used for most abdominal surgeries, except for surgery of the gallbladder or pelvis (see <a href="#ff15-6">Fig.&#x00A0;15-6</a>A).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The Trendelenburg position usually is used for surgery on the lower abdomen and pelvis to obtain good exposure by displacing the intestines into the upper abdomen. In this position, the head and body are lowered. The patient is supported in position by padded shoulder braces (see <a href="#ff15-6">Fig.&#x00A0;15-6</a>B), bean bags, and foam padding. Reverse Trendelenburg position provides the space to operate on the upper abdomen by shifting the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page435" title="435"></span>intestines into the pelvis. A padded footboard and other supportive cushioning preserve a safe environment for the patient.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The lithotomy position is used for nearly all perineal, rectal, and vaginal surgical procedures (see <a href="#ff15-6">Fig.&#x00A0;15-6</a>C). The patient is positioned on the back with the legs and thighs flexed. The position is maintained by placing the feet in stirrups.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The Sims or lateral position is used for renal surgery. The patient is placed on the nonoperative side with an air pillow 12.5 to 15 cm (5 to 6 inches) thick under the loin, or on a table with a kidney or back lift (see <a href="#ff15-6">Fig.&#x00A0;15-6</a>D).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROTECTING THE</small> P<small>ATIENT FROM</small> I<small>NJURY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Various activities are used to address the diverse patient safety issues that arise in the OR. The nurse protects the patient from injury by providing a safe environment. Verifying information, checking the medical record for completeness, and maintaining surgical asepsis and an optimal environment are critical nursing responsibilities. Verification that all the required documentation is completed is an important function of the intraoperative nurse. A surgical checklist is used prior to induction of anesthesia, before the skin incision is made, and before the patient leaves the OR (see <a href="c15-sec01.xhtml#ff15-1">Fig.&#x00A0;15-1</a>). It is important to review the patient&#x2019;s record for the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Allergies (including latex)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Correct informed surgical consent, with patient&#x2019;s signature</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Completed records for health history and physical examination</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Results of diagnostic studies</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In addition to checking that all necessary patient data are complete, the perioperative nurse obtains the necessary equipment specific to the procedure. The need for nonroutine medications, blood components, instruments, and other equipment and supplies is assessed, and the readiness of the room, completeness of physical setup, and completeness of instrument, suture, and dressing setups are determined. Any aspects of the OR environment that may negatively affect the patient are identified. These include physical features, such as room temperature and humidity; electrical hazards; potential contaminants (dust, blood, and discharge on floor or surfaces; uncovered hair; nonsterile attire of personnel; jewelry worn by personnel; chipped or artificial fingernails); and unnecessary traffic. The circulating nurse also sets up and maintains suction equipment in working order, initiates appropriate physical comfort measures for the patient, and prepares any potential implantable devices and medications used at the surgical field.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Preventing physical injury includes using safety straps and side rails and not leaving the sedated patient unattended. Transferring the patient from the stretcher to the OR table requires safe transferring practices. Other safety measures include properly positioning a grounding pad under the patient to prevent electrical burns and shock, removing excess antiseptic solution from the patient&#x2019;s skin, and promptly and completely draping exposed areas after the sterile field has been created to decrease the risk of hypothermia.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing measures to prevent injury from excessive blood loss include blood conservation using equipment such as a cell saver (a device for recirculating the patient&#x2019;s own blood cells) and administration of blood products (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Fewer patients undergoing an elective procedure require blood transfusion, but those undergoing high-risk procedures (such as orthopedic or cardiac surgeries) may require an intraoperative transfusion. The circulating nurse anticipates this need, checks that blood has been cross-matched and held in reserve, and is prepared to administer blood.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>S<small>ERVING AS</small> P<small>ATIENT</small> A<small>DVOCATE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient undergoing general anesthesia or moderate sedation experiences temporary sensory or perceptual alteration or loss, and has an increased need for protection and advocacy. Patient advocacy in the OR entails maintaining the patient&#x2019;s physical and emotional comfort, privacy, rights, and dignity. Patients, whether conscious or unconscious, should not be subjected to excess noise, inappropriate conversation, or, most of all, derogatory comments. Other advocacy activities include minimizing the clinical, dehumanizing aspects of being a surgical patient by making sure that the patient is treated as a person, respecting cultural and spiritual values, providing physical privacy, maintaining confidentiality, and contacting approved family or support personnel about updates throughout the procedure.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> R<small>ETAINED</small> S<small>URGICAL</small> I<small>TEMS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">It is the entire surgical team&#x2019;s responsibility to provide vigilance and communication regarding items entering and leaving the surgical site. As part of their responsibilities, the circulating nurse and scrub personnel must account for items introduced to the sterile field. This includes sponges, needles, instruments, and access devices. Some of these items are radiopaque (visible under x-ray), others are not. All items must be accounted for at the beginning of surgery, prior to wound closure, and again at skin closure. The nurse serves as a patient advocate to alert the team of any missing items. Technology can assist in surgical item identification; however, it should not be used as the primary source for counting.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">It is the responsibility of the surgeon and the anesthesiologist or CRNA to monitor and manage complications. However, intraoperative nurses also play an important role. Being alert to and reporting changes in vital signs, cardiac arrhythmias, symptoms of nausea and vomiting, anaphylaxis, hypoxia, hypothermia, and MH and assisting with their management are important nursing functions. Each of these complications was discussed earlier. Maintaining asepsis and preventing infection are responsibilities of all members of the surgical team (<a href="#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Evidence-based interventions to decrease SSIs include appropriate skin preparation and antibiotic administration. These interventions are discussed by the surgical team and documented by the nurse in the intraoperative record.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Expected patient outcomes may include:</p>
<p class="ProcessNL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span>Exhibits low level of anxiety while awake during the intraoperative phase of care</p>
<p class="ProcessNL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span>Has no symptoms of latex allergy</p>

<p class="ProcessNL1Middle"><span class="numah">4.</span>Experiences no unexpected threats to safety</p>
<p class="ProcessNL1Middle"><span class="numah">5.</span>Has dignity preserved throughout OR experience</p>
<p class="ProcessNL1Middle"><span class="numah">6.</span>Is free of complications (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, nausea and vomiting, anaphylaxis, hypoxia, hypothermia, or MH or experiences successful management of adverse effects of surgery and anesthesia should they occur)</p>

<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/ebp.jpg" alt=""/> A 48-year-old man is scheduled to have robotic-assisted abdominal surgery. What is the best evidence for how his vital signs should be monitored? As the OR nurse, what best practices should you implement to support the patient and OR team during this minimally invasive surgery?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/ipc.jpg" alt=""/> A 66-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is scheduled for an elective procedure to remove a lipoma on her chest. She is having problems breathing, is agitated, and cannot lie flat on the surgical bed. How will you, as the circulating nurse, facilitate an interprofessional discussion to improve the patient&#x2019;s breathing and relieve her agitation? Which members of the surgical team are essential to include?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/pq.jpg" alt=""/> Identify the priorities, assessments, and nursing interventions you would implement for a 76-year-old female patient who is hard of hearing and is having spinal anesthesia for total knee replacement surgery. How would your priorities, approach, and techniques differ if the patient is having general anesthesia? What other risks should be considered based on this patient&#x2019;s age?</p>
