<p class="nonindent"><strong>Acute kidney injury (AKI)</strong> is a rapid loss of renal function due to damage to the kidneys. Depending on the duration and severity of AKI, a wide range of potentially life-threatening metabolic complications can occur, including metabolic acidosis as well as fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Treatment is aimed at replacing renal function temporarily to minimize potentially lethal complications and reduce potential causes of increased kidney injury with the goal of minimizing long-term loss of renal function.</p>
<p class="indent">AKI is a problem seen in patients who are hospitalized and those in outpatient settings. A widely accepted criterion for AKI is a 50% or greater increase in serum creatinine above baseline (normal creatinine is less than 1 mg/dL) (The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative, 2004). Urine volume may be normal, or changes may occur including nonoliguria (greater than 800 mL/day), <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;oliguria:&lt;/b&gt; diminished urine output; less than 0.5 mL/kg/h over at least 6 hours, or less than 400 mL in 24 hours">oliguria</button></strong> (less than 400 mL/day or 0.5 mL/kg/h over 6 hours), or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anuria:&lt;/b&gt; urine output of less than 50 mL/24 h">anuria</button></strong> (less than 50 mL/day) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2145"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Since that time, several risks for both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis to COVID-19 have been identified (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>, <a href="c66-sec05.xhtml#ct66-8">Chart&#x00A0;66-8</a>). Findings from a retrospective, single-center study of 1392 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, reported that 7% developed AKI during hospitalization (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3536">Cheng, Luo, Wang, et al., 2020</a>). Factors associated with high risk of developing AKI included more severe disease, a high serum creatinine at baseline, lymphopenia, and elevated D-dimer level (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Cheng et al., 2020</a>). Patients who developed AKI were more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit and had a higher mortality rate compared to patients who did not develop AKI. Of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1565" title="1565"></span>those patients who survived to be discharged from the hospital, 68% recovered from AKI (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Cheng et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2146">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although the pathogenesis of AKI and oliguria is not always known, many times there is a specific underlying cause. Some of the factors may be reversible if identified and treated promptly, before kidney function is impaired. This is true of the following conditions that reduce blood flow to the kidney and impair kidney function: hypovolemia; hypotension; reduced cardiac output and heart failure; obstruction of the kidney or lower urinary tract by tumor, blood clot, or kidney stone; and bilateral obstruction of the renal arteries or veins. If these conditions are treated and corrected before the kidneys are permanently damaged, the increased BUN and creatinine levels, oliguria, and other signs may be reversed.</p>
<p class="indent">Although renal stones are not a common cause of AKI, some recurrent types may increase the risk of AKI. Some hereditary stone diseases (see <a href="c49.xhtml">Chapter 49</a>), primary struvite stones, and infection-related urolithiasis associated with anatomic and functional urinary tract anomalies and spinal cord injury may cause repeated bouts of obstruction as well as crystal-specific damage to tubular epithelial cells and interstitial renal cells (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2147">Classifications of Acute Kidney Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The term acute kidney injury has replaced the term acute renal failure because it better describes this syndrome, in both those who require RRT and also in those patients who experience minor changes in renal function. Classification criteria for AKI include assessment of three grades of severity and two outcome-level classifications. This 5-point system is known as the RIFLE classification system. RIFLE stands for <em>risk, injury, failure, loss, and ESKD</em> (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3532">Bellomo et al., 2004</a>). Risk, injury, and failure are considered grades of AKI severity, whereas loss and ESKD are considered outcomes of loss that require some form of RRT, at least temporarily (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3532">Bellomo et al., 2004</a>). <a href="#tt48-2">Table&#x00A0;48-2</a> lists the classification criteria for the RIFLE system for AKI (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3532">Bellomo et al., 2004</a>). This classification system is used by health care professionals to identify kidney injury and improve patient outcomes. A diagnosis of AKI results in significantly longer hospital stays, has an increased mortality rate, and is a major risk factor for the development of CKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Medel-Herrero, Mitchell, &#x0026; Moyce, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2148">Categories of Acute Kidney Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The major categories of AKI are prerenal (hypoperfusion of kidney), intrarenal (actual damage to kidney tissue), and postrenal (obstruction to urine flow). Prerenal AKI, which occurs in 60% to 70% of cases, is the result of impaired blood flow that leads to hypoperfusion of the kidney commonly caused by volume depletion (burns, hemorrhage, GI losses), hypotension (sepsis, shock), and obstruction of renal vessels, ultimately leading to a decrease in the GFR (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>). Intrarenal or intrinsic AKI is the result of actual parenchymal damage to the glomeruli or kidney tubules. <strong>Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)</strong>, or AKI in which there is damage to the kidney tubules, is the most common type of intrinsic AKI. Characteristics of ATN are intratubular obstruction, tubular back leak (abnormal reabsorption of filtrate and decreased urine flow through the tubule), vasoconstriction, and changes in glomerular permeability. These processes result in a decrease of GFR, progressive azotemia, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances. CKD, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, and cirrhosis can contribute to ATN. Postrenal AKI usually results from obstruction distal to the kidney by conditions such as renal calculi, strictures, blood clots, benign prostatic hyperplasia, malignancies, and pregnancy. Pressure rises in the kidney tubules, and eventually the GFR decreases. Common causes of each type of AKI are further summarized in <a href="#ct48-4">Chart&#x00A0;48-4</a>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2149">Phases of Acute Kidney Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are four phases of AKI: initiation, oliguria, diuresis, and recovery.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The initiation period begins with the initial insult and ends when oliguria develops.</span></li>
<li><span>The oliguria period is accompanied by an increase in the serum concentration of substances usually excreted by the kidneys (urea, creatinine, uric acid, organic acids, phosphorus, and the intracellular cations [potassium and magnesium]). The minimum amount of urine needed to rid the body of normal metabolic waste products is approximately 400 mL in 24 hours or 0.5 mL/kg/h over 6 hours. In this phase, uremic symptoms first appear and life-threatening conditions such as hyperkalemia develop.</span></li>
<li><span>The diuresis period is marked by a gradual increase in urine output, which signals that glomerular filtration has started to recover. Laboratory values stabilize and eventually decrease. Although the volume of urinary output may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1566" title="1566"></span>reach normal or elevated levels, renal function may still be markedly abnormal, since the filtration of urea and creatinine has not yet commenced. Because uremic symptoms may still be present, the need for expert medical and nursing management continues. The patient must be observed closely for dehydration during this phase; if dehydration occurs, the uremic symptoms are likely to increase and an elevated serum BUN and creatinine will be noted.</span></li>
<li><span>The recovery period signals the improvement of renal function and may take 3 to 12 months. Laboratory values return to the patient&#x2019;s normal level. Although a permanent 1% to 3% reduction in the GFR may occur, it is not clinically significant. However, in those patients with preexisting CKD, an episode of AKI may necessitate beginning CRRT.</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2151">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the patient with AKI includes evaluation for changes in the urine, diagnostic tests that evaluate the kidney contour, and a variety of laboratory values. See <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a> for information about the normal characteristics of urine, diagnostic findings, and laboratory values in the renal system.</p>
<p class="indent">In AKI, urine output varies from scanty to a normal volume, hematuria may be present, and the urine has a low specific gravity (compared with a normal value of 1.010 to 1.025). One of the earliest manifestations of tubular damage is the inability to concentrate the urine (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>). Patients with prerenal azotemia have a decreased amount of sodium in the urine (less than 20 mEq/L) and normal urinary sediment. Patients with intrarenal azotemia usually have increased urinary sodium levels greater than 40 mEq/L with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urinary casts:&lt;/b&gt; proteins secreted by damaged kidney tubules">urinary casts</button></strong> and other cellular debris.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasonography is a critical component of the evaluation of patients with kidney disease. A renal sonogram or a noncontrast CT scan may show evidence of anatomic changes.</p>
<p class="indent">The BUN level increases steadily at a rate that depends on the degree of catabolism (breakdown of protein), renal perfusion, and protein intake. Serum creatinine levels are useful in monitoring kidney function and disease progression and increase with glomerular damage.</p>
<p class="indent">With a decline in the GFR, oliguria, and anuria, patients are at high risk for hyperkalemia. Protein catabolism results in the release of cellular potassium into the body fluids, causing severe hyperkalemia (high serum potassium levels). Hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest. Sources of potassium include normal tissue catabolism, dietary intake, blood in the GI tract, or blood transfusion and other sources (e.g., IV infusions, potassium penicillin, and extracellular shift in response to metabolic acidosis).</p>
<p class="indent">Progressive metabolic acidosis occurs in kidney disease because patients cannot eliminate the daily metabolic load of acid-type substances produced by the normal metabolic processes. In addition, normal renal buffering mechanisms fail. This is reflected by decreased serum carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and pH levels.</p>
<p class="indent">Blood phosphorus concentrations may increase; calcium levels may be low due to decreased absorption of calcium from the intestine and as a compensatory mechanism for the elevated blood phosphate levels. Anemia is another common laboratory finding in AKI, as a result of reduced erythropoietin production, uremic GI lesions, reduced RBC lifespan, and blood loss from the GI tract.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2152">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">AKI has a high mortality rate that ranges from 10% to 80%. Factors that influence mortality include severity of kidney injury, level and availability of medical care, requirements for RRT, increased age, increased number of comorbid conditions, and preexisting kidney and vascular diseases and respiratory failure (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>). Therefore, prevention of AKI is essential (see <a href="#ct48-5">Chart&#x00A0;48-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A careful history is obtained to identify exposure to nephrotoxic agents or environmental toxins. The kidneys are susceptible to the adverse effects of medications because the metabolic by-products of most medications are excreted by the kidneys. Patients taking nephrotoxic medications (e.g., aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin and tobramycin, polymyxin B, amphotericin B, vancomycin, amikacin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) should have drug levels monitored closely, since high serum levels will cause changes in renal function. Kidney function needs to be monitored prior to initiation of these medications and during therapy (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schira, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Chronic use of analgesic agents, particularly NSAIDs, may cause <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;interstitial nephritis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation within the renal tissue">interstitial nephritis</button></strong> (inflammation within the renal tissue) and papillary necrosis. Patients with heart failure or cirrhosis with ascites are at particular risk for NSAID-induced kidney disease. Increased age, preexisting kidney disease, diabetes, and the simultaneous administration of several nephrotoxic agents increase the risk of kidney damage (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schira, 2017</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a major cause of hospital-acquired AKI. However, this is potentially preventable in many, but not all, cases. Patients at high risk for the development of contrast-induced AKI are those with CKD and/or elevated creatinine due to dehydration. Those who need to undergo a coronary interventional procedure, which requires larger amounts of contrast media to be given, are at the greatest risk. Limiting the patient&#x2019;s exposure to contrast agents and nephrotoxic medications will reduce the risk of contrasted-induced AKI. Prehydration with IV normal saline is considered the most effective method to prevent contrast-induced AKI. N-acetylcysteine administration is no longer recommended as a preventative measure (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Nahar, 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1567</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1568" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1568">p. 1568</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2153"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">About half of all patients who develop AKI during hospitalization are older than 60 years and 40% have diabetes (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Pavkov, Harding, &#x0026; Burrows, 2018</a>). The etiology of AKI in older adults includes prerenal causes such as dehydration, intrarenal causes such as nephrotoxic agents (e.g., medications, contrast agents), and complications of major surgery (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hain, 2017</a>). Suppression of thirst, enforced bed rest, lack of access to drinking water, and confusion all contribute to the older patient&#x2019;s failure to consume adequate fluids and may lead to dehydration, further compromising already decreased renal function.</p>
<p class="indent">AKI in older adults is also often seen in the community setting. Nurses in the ambulatory setting need to be aware of the risk to patients taking medications that could result in damage to the kidney either through reduced circulation or nephrotoxicity. Outpatient procedures that require fasting or a bowel preparation may cause dehydration and, therefore, patients undergoing such procedures need careful monitoring.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2154">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys have a remarkable ability to recover from insult. The objectives of treatment for AKI are to restore normal chemical balance and prevent complications until repair of renal tissue and restoration of renal function can occur. Management includes eliminating the underlying cause; maintaining fluid balance; avoiding fluid excesses; and, when indicated, providing RRT. Prerenal azotemia is treated by optimizing renal perfusion, whereas postrenal failure is treated by relieving the obstruction. Intrarenal or intrinsic azotemia is treated with supportive therapy, with removal of causative agents, aggressive management of pre- and postrenal failure, and avoidance of associated risk factors. Shock and infection, if present, are treated promptly (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). The patient who has had a crush injury, compartment syndrome, or heat-induced illness with subsequent myoglobinuria (myoglobin in the urine) is treated for rhabdomyolysis (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>) (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Maintenance of fluid balance is based on daily body weight, serial measurements of central venous pressure, serum and urine concentrations, fluid intake and output, blood pressure, and the clinical status of the patient. The parenteral and oral intake and the output of urine, gastric drainage, stools, wound drainage, and perspiration are calculated and are used as the basis for fluid replacement. The insensible fluid produced through the normal metabolic processes and lost through the skin and lungs is also considered in fluid management.</p>
<p class="indent">Fluid excesses can be detected by the clinical findings of dyspnea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins. The patient&#x2019;s lungs are auscultated for moist crackles. Because pulmonary edema may be caused by excessive administration of parenteral fluids, extreme caution must be used to prevent fluid overload. The development of generalized edema is assessed by examining the presacral and pretibial areas several times daily. Furosemide or bumetanide, both loop diuretics, may be prescribed to initiate diuresis, although there is no consensus regarding the use of loop diuretics in AKI (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Adequate renal blood flow in patients with prerenal causes of AKI may be restored by IV fluids or transfusions of blood products. If AKI is caused by hypovolemia secondary to hypoproteinemia, an infusion of albumin may be prescribed. Dialysis may be initiated to prevent complications of AKI, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, pericarditis, and pulmonary edema. Dialysis corrects many biochemical abnormalities; allows for liberalization of fluid, protein, and sodium intake; diminishes bleeding tendencies; and promotes wound healing. <strong>Hemodialysis (HD)</strong> (a procedure that circulates the patient&#x2019;s blood through an artificial kidney [dialyzer] to remove waste products and excess fluid), <strong>peritoneal dialysis (PD)</strong>; a procedure that uses the patient&#x2019;s peritoneal membrane (the lining of the peritoneal cavity) as the semipermeable membrane to exchange fluid and solutes, or a variety of <strong>continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)</strong> (methods used to replace normal kidney function by circulating the patient&#x2019;s blood through a hemofilter) may be performed (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>). These and other treatment modalities for patients with renal dysfunction are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperkalemia is the most life-threatening of the fluid and electrolyte changes that occur in patients with kidney disorders. Therefore, the patient is monitored for hyperkalemia through serial serum electrolyte levels (potassium value greater than 5.0 mEq/L [5 mmol/L]), ECG changes (tall, tented, or peaked T waves), and changes in clinical status (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>). Other symptoms of hyperkalemia include irritability, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, paresthesia, and generalized muscle weakness. Muscle weakness may present as slurred speech, difficulty breathing, paresthesia, and paralysis. As the potassium level increases, both cardiac and other muscular function declines, making this a medical emergency.</p>
<p class="indent">The elevated potassium levels may be reduced by administering cation-exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or by retention enema that works by exchanging sodium ions for potassium ions in the intestinal tract. The slow onset of action of more than 6 hours limits its use to those patients without emergent hyperkalemia causing ECG changes. Sorbitol may be given in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate to induce a diarrhea-type effect (by inducing water loss in the GI tract). If a sodium polystyrene sulfonate retention enema is given (the colon is the major site of potassium exchange), a rectal catheter with a balloon may be used to facilitate retention if necessary (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>). Afterward, a cleansing enema may be prescribed to remove remaining medication as a precaution against fecal impaction.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is experiencing ECG changes, IV dextrose 50%, insulin, and calcium replacement may be given to shift potassium back into the cells. Since the medications are administered IV, they take effect quickly. The shift of potassium into the intracellular space is temporary, so arrangements for dialysis need to be made on an emergent basis. The capillary glucose level is monitored for hypoglycemia with insulin administration (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Ross, Nissenson, &#x0026; Daugirdas, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many medications are eliminated through the kidneys; therefore, dosages must be reduced when a patient has AKI. Examples of commonly used agents that require adjustment are antibiotic medications (especially aminoglycosides), digoxin, phenytoin, ACE inhibitors, and magnesium-containing agents.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with severe acidosis, the arterial blood gases and serum bicarbonate levels must be monitored because the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1569" title="1569"></span>patient may require sodium bicarbonate therapy or dialysis. If respiratory problems develop, appropriate ventilatory measures must be instituted. The elevated serum phosphorus level may be controlled with phosphate-binding agents (e.g., calcium or lanthanum carbonate) that help prevent a continuing rise in serum phosphorus levels by binding with the phosphate from food in the intestinal tract and eliminating it in the stool, thus preventing absorption (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Schonder, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">AKI causes severe nutritional imbalances (because nausea and vomiting contribute to inadequate dietary intake), impaired glucose use and protein synthesis, and increased tissue catabolism. The patient is weighed daily and loses 0.2 to 0.5 kg (0.5 to 1 lb) daily if the nitrogen balance is negative (i.e., caloric intake falls below caloric requirements). If the patient gains or does not lose weight or develops hypertension, fluid retention should be suspected.</p>
<p class="indent">Nutritional support is based on the underlying cause of AKI, the catabolic response, the type and frequency of RRT, comorbidities, and nutritional status. Replacement of dietary proteins is individualized to provide the maximum benefit and minimize uremic symptoms. Caloric requirements are met with high-carbohydrate meals, because carbohydrates have a protein-sparing effect (i.e., in a high-carbohydrate diet, protein is not used for meeting energy requirements but is &#x201C;spared&#x201D; for growth and tissue healing). Foods and fluids containing sodium, potassium, or phosphorus (e.g., bananas, citrus fruits and juices, dairy foods) are restricted.</p>
<p class="indent">The oliguric phase of AKI may last 10 to 14 days and is followed by the diuretic phase, at which time urine output begins to increase, signaling the patient is in the recovery phase (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>). Results of blood chemistry tests are used to determine the amounts of sodium, potassium, and water needed for replacement, along with assessment for over- or under hydration (daily weights). Following the diuretic phase, the patient is placed on a high-protein, high-calorie diet and is encouraged to resume activities gradually.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2155">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse has an important role in caring for the patient with AKI. The nurse monitors for complications, participates in emergency treatment of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, assesses the patient&#x2019;s progress and response to treatment, and provides physical and emotional support. In addition, the nurse keeps family members informed about the patient&#x2019;s condition, helps them understand the treatments, and provides psychological support. Although the development of AKI may be the most serious problem, the nurse continues to provide nursing care indicated for the primary disorder (e.g., burns, shock, trauma, obstruction of the urinary tract).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Fluid and Electrolyte Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the serious fluid and electrolyte imbalances that can occur with AKI, the nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s serum electrolyte levels and physical indicators of these complications during all phases of the disorder. IV solutions must be carefully selected based on the patient&#x2019;s fluid and electrolyte status. The patient&#x2019;s cardiac function and musculoskeletal status are monitored closely for signs of hyperkalemia.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Hyperkalemia is the most immediate life-threatening imbalance seen in AKI. Parenteral fluids, all oral intake, and all medications are screened carefully to ensure that sources of potassium are not inadvertently given or consumed.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The nurse monitors fluid status by paying careful attention to fluid intake (IV medications should be given in the smallest volume possible), urine output, apparent edema, distention of the jugular veins, alterations in heart sounds and breath sounds, and increasing difficulty in breathing. Accurate daily weights, as well as I&#x0026;O records, are essential. Indicators of deteriorating fluid and electrolyte status are reported immediately to the primary provider, and preparation is made for emergency treatment. Severe fluid and electrolyte disturbances may be treated with HD, PD, or CRRT.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Metabolic Rate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse takes steps to reduce the patient&#x2019;s metabolic rate. Fever and infection, both of which increase the metabolic rate and catabolism, are prevented and treated promptly; blood, urine and wound cultures are ordered as indicated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Pulmonary Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Attention is given to pulmonary function, and the patient is assisted to turn, cough, and take deep breaths frequently to prevent atelectasis and respiratory tract infection. Drowsiness and lethargy may prevent the patient from moving and turning without encouragement and assistance.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Asepsis is essential with invasive lines and catheters to minimize the risk of infection and increased metabolism. An indwelling urinary catheter is avoided whenever possible due to the high risk of UTI associated with its use, but may be required to provide ongoing data required to accurately monitor fluid I&#x0026;O.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Skin Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The skin may be dry or susceptible to breakdown as a result of edema; therefore, meticulous skin care is important. In addition, excoriation and itching of the skin may result from the deposit of irritating toxins in the patient&#x2019;s tissues. Bathing the patient with cool water, frequent turning, and keeping the skin clean and well moisturized and the fingernails trimmed to avoid scratching are often comforting and prevent skin breakdown.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Psychosocial Support</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with AKI may require treatment with HD, PD, or CRRT. The length of time that these treatments are necessary varies with the cause and extent of damage to the kidneys. The patient and family need assistance, explanation, and support during this period. The purpose of the treatment is explained to the patient and family by the primary provider. However, high levels of anxiety and fear may necessitate repeated explanation and clarification by the nurse. The family members may initially be afraid to touch and talk to the patient during these procedures but should be encouraged and assisted to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">In an intensive care setting, many of the nurse&#x2019;s functions are devoted to the technical aspects of patient care; however, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1570" title="1570"></span>it is essential that the psychological needs and other concerns of the patient and family be addressed. Continued assessment of the patient for complications of AKI and precipitating causes is essential (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Odom, 2017</a>).</p>
