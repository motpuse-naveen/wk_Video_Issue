<h4 class="h4" id="s1899">Chronic Pancreatitis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive destruction of the pancreas. As cells are replaced by fibrous tissue with repeated attacks of pancreatitis, pressure within the pancreas increases. The result is obstruction of the pancreatic and common bile ducts and the duodenum. In addition, there is atrophy of the epithelium of the ducts, inflammation, and destruction of the secreting cells of the pancreas.</p>
<p class="indent">Alcohol consumption in Western societies and malnutrition worldwide are the major causes of chronic pancreatitis. Patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1434" title="1434"></span>typically present between the ages of 40 and 60 years (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). Frequently, at that age, patients already report a long history of alcohol abuse. Excessive and prolonged consumption of alcohol accounts for approximately 70% to 80% of all cases of chronic pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Srinivasan &#x0026; Friedman, 2018</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Townsend et al., 2016</a>). The incidence of pancreatitis is 50 times greater in people with alcoholism than in those who do not abuse alcohol. Long-term alcohol consumption causes hypersecretion of protein in pancreatic secretions, resulting in protein plugs and calculi within the pancreatic ducts. Alcohol also has a direct toxic effect on the cells of the pancreas. Damage to these cells is more likely to occur and to be more severe in patients whose diets are poor in protein content and either very high or very low in fat.</p>
<p class="indent">Smoking is another factor in the development of chronic pancreatitis. Because smoking and alcohol are often associated, it is difficult to separate the effects of these two factors (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Aune et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>).</p>

Attacks are often so painful that opioids, even in large doses, do not provide relief. The risk of opioid dependence is increased in pancreatitis because of the chronic nature and severity of the pain. As the disease progresses, recurring attacks of pain are more severe, more frequent, and of longer duration. Some patients experience continuous severe pain, and others have dull, nagging constant pain. Periods of well-being sometimes follow the episodes of pain (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). In some patients, chronic pancreatitis is painless. The natural history of abdominal pain (character, timing, severity) is variable, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1437" title="1437"></span>and many studies have documented a decrease in pain (&#x201C;burnout&#x201D;) over time in a majority of patients (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Weight loss is a major problem in chronic pancreatitis. More than 80% of patients experience significant weight loss, which is usually caused by decreased dietary intake secondary to anorexia or fear that eating will precipitate another attack (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Kellerman &#x0026; Rakel, 2018</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). Malabsorption occurs late in the disease, when as little as 10% of pancreatic function remains (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Kellerman &#x0026; Rakel, 2018</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). As a result, digestion, especially of proteins and fats, is impaired. The stools become frequent, frothy, and foul smelling because of impaired fat digestion, which results in stools with a high fat content referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;steatorrhea:&lt;/b&gt; fatty stool; typically malodorous with an oily appearance and floats in water">steatorrhea</button></strong>. As the disease progresses, calcification of the gland may occur, and calcium stones may form within the ducts.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1901">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A CT scan is the initial diagnostic test that should be performed for patients in whom there is a suspicion of chronic pancreatitis. The presence of either calcifications, pancreatic ductal changes, or both of these findings can substantiate the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). MRCP is considered for further evaluation, should the CT findings be equivocal in patients with known risk factors. Transabdominal ultrasonography is frequently used as a screening method for patients with abdominal symptoms. EUS and laparoscopic ultrasound are capable of detecting very small abnormalities in the pancreas. EUS is frequently used early in the evaluation of patients with pancreatic disease, and MRCP is increasingly being used in select patients who are candidates for the most invasive imaging method, ERCP. EUS evaluates for parenchymal and ductal abnormalities that are useful for diagnosis and staging (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). The staging of disease is important in the care of patients, and a combination of imaging methods is usually used to confirm the stage (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). ERCP provides details about the anatomy of the pancreas and the pancreatic and biliary ducts. It is also helpful in obtaining tissue for analysis and differentiating pancreatitis from other conditions, such as carcinoma (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A glucose tolerance test evaluates pancreatic islet cell function and provides necessary information for making decisions about surgical resection of the pancreas. An abnormal glucose tolerance test may indicate the presence of diabetes associated with pancreatitis. Acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis may result in increased serum amylase levels. Steatorrhea is best confirmed by laboratory analysis of fecal fat content (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Kellerman &#x0026; Rakel, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1902">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of chronic pancreatitis depends on its probable cause in each patient. Treatment is directed toward preventing and managing acute attacks, relieving pain and discomfort, and managing exocrine and endocrine insufficiency of pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nonsurgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nonsurgical approaches may be indicated for the patient who refuses surgery, is a poor surgical risk, or when the disease and symptoms do not warrant surgical intervention. Endoscopy to remove pancreatic duct stones, correct strictures with stenting, and drain cysts may be effective in select patients to manage pain and relieve obstruction via ERCP (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Management of abdominal pain and discomfort is similar to that of acute pancreatitis; however, the focus is usually on the use of nonopioid methods to manage pain and the implementation of the WHO&#x2019;s three-step ladder for the treatment of chronic pain. This involves initiating monotherapy and, if ineffective, instituting combination therapy with peripherally acting and centrally acting medications. Pain management in the early stages may respond to nonopioid analgesics, but if the pain becomes more constant or debilitating, introduction of opioid analgesics is appropriate. The abuse of opioids is possible in these patients, and may be more likely in patients with depression, higher pain intensity, and history of alcohol misuse or abuse (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). Adjunct means of pain modulation, such as use of antioxidants, antidepressants, and nonopioid agents as well as avoidance of smoking and alcohol, are recommended before starting opioids for pain control (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). Antioxidants assist in the relief of pain and in improving quality of life and are often given to patients with chronic pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Jalal, Campbell, &#x0026; Hopper, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). An EUS with guided placement of a celiac nerve block is a potential option for managing the chronic, unrelieved pain of this disease (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). Yoga and other mindfulness-based therapies may be effective nonpharmacologic methods for pain reduction and for relief of other coexisting symptoms of chronic pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Jalal et al., 2019</a>). Persistent, unrelieved pain is often the most difficult aspect of management (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Jalal et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). The primary provider, nurse, and dietitian emphasize to the patient and family the importance of avoiding alcohol and foods that have produced abdominal pain and discomfort in the past. The health care team stresses to the patient that no other treatment is likely to relieve pain if the patient continues to consume alcohol.</p>
<p class="indent">Diabetes resulting from dysfunction of the pancreatic islet cells is treated with diet, insulin, or oral antidiabetic agents. The hazard of severe hypoglycemia with alcohol consumption is stressed to the patient and family. Pancreatic enzyme replacement is indicated for the patient with malabsorption and steatorrhea.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic pancreatitis is not often managed by surgery. However, surgery may be indicated to relieve persistent abdominal pain and discomfort, restore drainage of pancreatic secretions, and reduce the frequency of acute attacks of pancreatitis and hospitalization (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Jalal et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). The type of surgery performed depends on the anatomic and functional abnormalities of the pancreas, including the location of disease within the pancreas, the presence of diabetes, exocrine insufficiency, biliary stenosis, and pseudocysts of the pancreas. Other considerations for surgery selection include the patient&#x2019;s likelihood for continued use of alcohol and the likelihood that the patient will be able to manage the endocrine or exocrine changes that are expected after surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Pancreaticojejunostomy (also referred to as Roux-en-Y), with a side-to-side anastomosis or joining of the pancreatic duct to the jejunum, allows drainage of the pancreatic secretions into the jejunum. Pain relief occurs within 6 months in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1438" title="1438"></span>more than 85% of the patients who undergo this procedure, but pain returns in a substantial number of patients as the disease progresses (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other surgical procedures may be performed for different degrees and types of underlying disorders. These procedures include revision of the sphincter of the ampulla of Vater, internal drainage of a pancreatic cyst into the stomach (see later discussion), insertion of a stent, and wide resection or removal of the pancreas. A Whipple&#x2019;s resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) can be carried out to relieve the pain of chronic pancreatitis (see later discussion under Tumors of the Head of the Pancreas). In an effort to provide permanent pain relief and avoid endocrine and exocrine insufficiency that ensue with major resections of the pancreas, some procedures combine limited resection of the head of the pancreas with a pancreaticojejunostomy. These procedures, known as the Beger or Frey operations, remove most of the head of the pancreas except for a shell of pancreatic tissue posteriorly (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Yeo, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When chronic pancreatitis develops as a result of gallbladder disease, surgery is performed to explore the common duct and remove the stones; usually, the gallbladder is removed at the same time. In addition, an attempt is made to improve the drainage of the CBD and the pancreatic duct by dividing the sphincter of Oddi, a muscle that is located at the ampulla of Vater (this surgical procedure is known as a sphincterotomy). A T-tube usually is placed in the common bile duct, requiring a drainage system to collect the bile postoperatively. Nursing care after such surgery is similar to that indicated after other biliary tract surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately two thirds of all patients with chronic pancreatitis can be managed with endoscopic or laparoscopic intervention (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Jalal et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>). Endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures such as distal pancreatectomy, longitudinal decompression of the pancreatic duct, nerve denervation, and stenting have been performed in patients with jaundice or recurrent inflammation and are being refined. Minimally invasive procedures to treat chronic pancreatitis may prove to be successful adjuncts in the management of this complex disorder (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Jalal et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Singh, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who undergo surgery for chronic pancreatitis may experience weight gain and improved nutritional status; this may result from reduction in pain associated with eating rather than from correction of malabsorption. However, morbidity and mortality after these surgical procedures are high because of the poor physical condition of the patient before surgery and the frequent presence of cirrhosis. Even after undergoing these surgical procedures, the patient is likely to continue to have pain and impaired digestion secondary to pancreatitis.</p>
