<h5 class="h5" id="s3119">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient complains of low back pain with muscle spasm and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sciatica:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the sciatic nerve, resulting in pain and tenderness along the nerve through the thigh and leg">sciatica</button></strong> (pain and tenderness that radiates along the sciatic nerve that runs through the thigh and leg). Pain is aggravated by actions that increase intraspinal fluid pressure, such as bending, lifting, or straining (as in sneezing or coughing), and usually is relieved by bed rest. There is often some type of postural deformity, because pain causes an alteration of the normal spinal mechanics. If the patient lies on the back and attempts to raise a leg in a straight position, pain radiates into the leg; this maneuver, called the <em>straight-leg raising test,</em> stretches the sciatic nerve. Additional signs include muscle weakness, alterations in tendon reflexes, and sensory loss.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3120">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of lumbar disc disease is based on the history and physical findings, specifically the location, quality, severity of pain, and the use of imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans as well as myelography.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3121">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The objectives of treatment are to relieve pain, slow disease progression, and increase the patient&#x2019;s functional ability. Bed rest is discouraged because it may weaken muscles, but activities that exacerbate pain should be avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">Because muscle spasm is prominent during the acute phase, muscle relaxants are used. NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids may be given to counter the inflammation and swelling that usually occurs in the supporting tissues and the affected nerve roots. Moist heat and massage help relax muscles. Strategies for increasing the patient&#x2019;s functional ability include weight reduction, physical therapy, and biofeedback. Exercises, prescribed by physical therapy, can help strengthen back muscles and decrease pain (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). See <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for descriptions of nursing interventions for the patient with pain.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2137</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2138" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2138">p. 2138</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the lumbar region, surgical treatment includes lumbar disc excision through a posterolateral laminotomy and the techniques of microdiscectomy and percutaneous discectomy. In microdiscectomy, an operating microscope is used to visualize the offending disc and compressed nerve roots; it permits a small incision (2.5 cm [1 inch]) and minimal blood loss and takes about 30 minutes of operating time. In general, the length of hospital stay is short, and the patient makes a rapid recovery. Several minimally invasive techniques in spinal surgery have led to improved patient outcomes and lower hospital costs (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A patient undergoing a disc procedure at one level of the vertebral column may have a degenerative process at other levels. A herniation relapse may occur at the same level or elsewhere, so the patient may become a candidate for another disc procedure. Arachnoiditis (inflammation of the arachnoid membrane) may occur after surgery (and after myelography); it involves an insidious onset of diffuse, frequently burning pain in the lower back, radiating into the buttocks. Disc excision can leave adhesions and scarring around the spinal nerves and dura, which then produce inflammatory changes that create chronic neuritis and neurofibrosis. Disc surgery may relieve pressure on the spinal nerves, but it does not reverse the effects of neural injury and scarring and the pain that results. Failed disc syndrome (recurrence of sciatica after lumbar discectomy) remains a cause of disability (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3122">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Preoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients fear surgery on any part of the spine and therefore need explanations about the surgery and reassurance that it will not weaken the back. When data are being collected for the health history, any reports of pain, paresthesia, or muscle spasm are recorded to provide a baseline for comparison after surgery. Health issues that may influence the postoperative course and quality of life (e.g., fatigue, mood, stress, patient expectations, smoking) are important to assess. Preoperative assessment also includes an evaluation of movement of the extremities as well as bladder and bowel function (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). To facilitate the postoperative turning procedure, the patient is instructed to turn as a unit (called logrolling) as part of the preoperative preparation. Before surgery, the patient is also encouraged to take deep breaths, cough, and perform muscle setting exercises to maintain muscle tone.</p>
<p class="indent">Research suggests that the use of motivational interviewing helps build self-confidence with self-care management of symptoms in the postoperative period (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4525">Scheffel, Amidei, &#x0026; Fitzgerald, 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct65-7">Chart&#x00A0;65-7</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Patient After Surgery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After lumbar disc excision, vital signs are checked frequently and the wound is inspected for hemorrhage, because vascular injury is a complication of disc surgery. Because postoperative neurologic deficits may occur from nerve root injury, the sensation and motor strength of the lower extremities are evaluated at specified intervals, along with the color and temperature of the legs and sensation of the toes. It is important to assess for urinary retention, which is another sign of neurologic deterioration (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). In discectomy with fusion, the patient has an additional surgical incision if bone fragments were taken from the iliac crest or fibula to serve as wedges in the spine. The recovery period is longer for patients who undergo discectomy with spinal fusion, because bony union must take place.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Positioning the Patient</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To position the patient, a pillow is placed under the head, and the knee rest is elevated slightly to relax the back muscles. When the patient is lying on one side, however, extreme knee flexion must be avoided. The patient is encouraged to move from side to side to relieve pressure and is reassured that no injury will result from moving. When the patient is ready to turn, the bed is placed in a flat position and a pillow is placed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2139" title="2139"></span>between the patient&#x2019;s legs. The patient turns as a unit (logrolls) without twisting the back.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Improving Confidence with Self-Care Management</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Scheffel, K., Amidei, C., &#x0026; Fitzgerald, K. A. (2019). Motivational interviewing: Improving confidence with self-care management in postoperative thoracolumbar spine patients. <em>Journal of Neuroscience Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>51</em>(3), 113&#x2013;117.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients undergoing spine surgery often lack confidence in self-care management of symptoms such as pain, lack of sleep, depression, and immobility. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a targeted motivational interview would improve confidence with self-care management of symptoms following spine surgery.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This pilot study used a quasi-experimental, one group, pretest&#x2013;posttest design with 15 participants who were undergoing spine surgery. The two main instruments used to gather data included the 10-item Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Health Confidence Index (HCI).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Paired sample <em>t</em>-tests of the pre- and postintervention scores on both the ODI and HCI showed statistically significant differences. The HCI showed a statistically significant increase in scores with mean preintervention scores of 6.73 (SD = 2.12) and mean postintervention scores of 8.73 (SD = 1.43) indicating a significant increase in confidence in self-care of symptom-related disability.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Motivational interviewing is an effective strategy for implementing health promoting behaviors. This study adds evidence that motivational interviewing is a strategy nurses can use to improve patients&#x2019; confidence in self-care management of symptoms following spine surgery.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">To get out of bed, the patient lies on one side while pushing up to a sitting position. At the same time, the nurse or family member eases the patient&#x2019;s legs over the side of the bed. Coming to a sitting or standing posture is accomplished in one long, smooth motion. Most patients walk to the bathroom on the same day as the surgery. Sitting is discouraged except for defecation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="ex2" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is instructed to increase activity gradually, as tolerated, because it takes up to 6 weeks for the ligaments to heal. Excessive activity may result in spasm of the paraspinal muscles (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Activities that produce flexion strain on the spine (e.g., driving a car) should be avoided until healing has taken place. Heat may be applied to the back to relax muscle spasms. Scheduled rest periods are important, and the patient is advised to avoid heavy work for 2 to 3 months after surgery. Exercises are prescribed to strengthen the abdominal and erector spinal muscles. A back brace or corset may be necessary if back pain persists.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Referral for inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation may be warranted to improve self-care abilities after medical or surgical treatment for herniation of a lumbar disc. A home care referral may be indicated and provides the nurse with the opportunity to assess the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status, as well as their ability to adhere to recommended management strategies. During the home visit, the nurse determines whether changes in neurologic function have occurred. The adequacy of pain management is assessed, and modifications are made to ensure adequate pain relief (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
