<p class="nonindent"><strong>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)</strong> is an emergent situation characterized by an acute onset of myocardial ischemia that results in myocardial death (i.e., MI) if definitive interventions do not occur promptly. (Although the terms <em>coronary occlusion, heart attack,</em> and <em>myocardial infarction</em> are used synonymously, the preferred term is <em>myocardial infarction.</em>) The spectrum of ACS includes unstable angina, NSTEMI, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s845">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In unstable angina, there is reduced blood flow in a coronary artery, often due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. A clot begins to form on top of the coronary lesion, but the artery is not completely occluded. This is an acute situation that can result in chest pain and other symptoms that may be referred to as preinfarction angina because the patient will likely have an MI if prompt interventions do not occur.</p>
<p class="indent">In an MI, plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation result in complete occlusion of the artery, leading to ischemia and necrosis of the myocardium supplied by that artery. Vasospasm (sudden constriction or narrowing) of a coronary artery, decreased oxygen supply (e.g., from acute blood loss, anemia, or low blood pressure), and increased demand for oxygen (e.g., from a rapid heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, or ingestion of cocaine) are other causes of MI. In each case, a profound imbalance exists between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.</p>
<p class="indent">The area of infarction develops over minutes to hours. As the cells are deprived of oxygen, ischemia develops, cellular injury occurs, and the lack of oxygen results in infarction, or the death of cells. The expression &#x201C;time is muscle&#x201D; reflects the urgency of appropriate treatment to improve patient outcomes. Approximately every 40 seconds, an American will have an MI (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1751">Benjamin et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>), and many of these people will die as a result. Early recognition and treatment of patients presenting with an MI will improve their chances of survival.</p>
<p class="indent">Various descriptions are used to further identify an MI: the type (NSTEMI, STEMI), the location of the injury to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page738" title="738"></span>ventricular wall (anterior, inferior, posterior, or lateral wall), and the point in time within the process of infarction (acute, evolving, or old). The differentiation between NSTEMI and STEMI is determined by diagnostic tests and is explained later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The 12-lead ECG identifies the type and location of the MI, and other ECG indicators, such as a Q wave, and patient history, identify the timing. Regardless of the location, the goals of medical therapy are to relieve symptoms, prevent or minimize myocardial tissue death, and prevent complications. The pathophysiology of CAD and the risk factors involved were discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s846">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chest pain that occurs suddenly and continues despite rest and medication is the presenting symptom in most patients with ACS. Some of these patients have prodromal symptoms or a previous diagnosis of CAD, but others report no previous symptoms. Patients may present with a combination of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, indigestion, nausea, and anxiety. They may have cool, pale, and moist skin. Their heart rate and respiratory rate may be faster than normal. These signs and symptoms, which are caused by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, may be present for only a short time or may persist. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of MI cannot be distinguished from those of unstable angina; hence, the evolution of the term <em>acute coronary syndrome.</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s847">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of ACS is generally based on the presenting symptoms (see <a href="#ct23-6">Chart 23-6</a>); the 12-lead ECG and laboratory tests (e.g., serial cardiac biomarkers) are performed to clarify whether the patient has unstable angina, NSTEMI, or STEMI (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1761">Ibanez et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The prognosis depends on the severity of coronary artery obstruction and the presence and extent of myocardial damage. Physical examination is always conducted, but the examination alone does not confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Patient History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient history includes the description of the presenting symptom (e.g., pain), the history of previous cardiac and other illnesses, and the family history of heart disease. The history should also include information about the patient&#x2019;s risk factors for heart disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Electrocardiogram</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The 12-lead ECG provides information that assists in ruling out or diagnosing an acute MI. It should be obtained within 10 minutes from the time a patient reports pain or arrives in the ED. By monitoring serial ECG changes over time, the location, evolution, and resolution of an MI can be identified and monitored.</p>
<p class="indent">The ECG changes that occur with an MI are seen in the leads that view the involved surface of the heart. The expected ECG changes are T-wave inversion, ST-segment elevation, and development of an abnormal Q wave (see <a href="#ff23-5">Fig. 23-5</a>). Because infarction evolves over time, the ECG also changes over time. The first ECG signs of an acute MI are usually seen in the T wave and ST segment (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). As the area of injury becomes ischemic, myocardial repolarization is altered and delayed, causing the T wave to invert. Myocardial injury also causes ST-segment changes. The ST segment is normally flat on the ECG tracing. The injured myocardial cells depolarize normally but repolarize more rapidly than normal cells, causing the ST segment to rise at least 1 mm above the isoelectric line (the area between the T wave and the next P wave is used as the reference for the isoelectric line). This change is measured 0.06 to 0.08 seconds after the end of the QRS&#x2014;a point called the <em>J point</em> (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="#ff23-6">Fig. 23-6</a>). An elevation in the ST segment in two contiguous leads is a key diagnostic indicator for MI (i.e., STEMI).</p>

<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>In addition to ST-segment and T-wave changes, the electrocardiogram may show tachycardia, bradycardia, or other arrhythmias.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;respiratory weaning:&lt;/b&gt; process of gradual, systematic withdrawal or removal of ventilator, breathing tube, and oxygen">Respiratory</button></strong></p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Neurologic</strong></p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Psychological</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Fear with feeling of impending doom, or denial that anything is wrong.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The appearance of abnormal Q waves is another indication of MI. Q waves develop within 1 to 3 days because there is no depolarization current conducted from necrotic tissue (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). A new and significant Q wave is 0.04 seconds or longer and 25% of the R wave depth. An <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page739" title="739"></span>acute MI may also cause a significant decrease in the height of the R wave. During an acute MI, injury and ischemic changes are usually present. An abnormal Q wave may be present without ST-segment and T-wave changes, which indicates an old, not acute, MI. For some patients, there is no persistent ST elevation or other ECG changes; therefore, an NSTEMI is diagnosed by blood levels of cardiac biomarkers.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">Using the information presented, patients are diagnosed with one of the following forms of ACS:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Unstable angina:</em> The patient has clinical manifestations of coronary ischemia, but ECG and cardiac biomarkers show no evidence of acute MI.</span></li>
<li><span><em>STEMI:</em> The patient has ECG evidence of acute MI with characteristic changes in two contiguous leads on a 12-lead ECG. In this type of MI, there is a significant damage to the myocardium.</span></li>
<li><span><em>NSTEMI:</em> The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin) but no definite ECG evidence of acute MI. In this type of MI, there may be less damage to the myocardium.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">During recovery from an MI, the ST segment often is the first ECG indicator to return to normal. Q-wave alterations are usually permanent. An old STEMI is usually indicated by an abnormal Q wave or decreased height of the R wave without ST-segment and T-wave changes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Echocardiogram</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The echocardiogram is used to evaluate ventricular function. It may be used to assist in diagnosing an MI, especially when the ECG is nondiagnostic. The echocardiogram can detect hypokinetic and akinetic wall motion and can determine the ejection fraction (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Laboratory Tests</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac enzymes and biomarkers, which include troponin, creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin, are used to diagnose an acute MI. Cardiac biomarkers can be analyzed rapidly, expediting an accurate diagnosis. These tests are based on the release of cellular contents into the circulation when myocardial cells die.</p>
<p class="h7">Troponin</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;troponin:&lt;/b&gt; a cardiac muscle biomarker; measurement is used as an indicator of heart muscle injury">Troponin</button></strong>, a protein found in myocardial cells, regulates the myocardial contractile process. There are three isomers of troponin: C, I, and T. Troponins I and T are specific for cardiac muscle, and these biomarkers are currently recognized as reliable and critical markers of myocardial injury (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). An increase in the level of troponin in the serum can be detected within a few hours during acute MI. It remains elevated for a long period, often as long as 2 weeks, and it therefore can be used to detect recent myocardial damage. It should be noted that cardiac troponin levels may rise during inflammation and other forms of mechanical stress on the myocardium. These include sepsis, heart failure, and respiratory failure (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Felker &#x0026; Fudim, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Creatine Kinase and Its Isoenzymes</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are three CK isoenzymes: CK-MM (skeletal muscle), CK-MB (heart muscle), and CK-BB (brain tissue). CK-MB is the cardiac-specific isoenzyme; it is found mainly in cardiac cells and therefore increases when there has been damage to these cells. Elevated CK-MB is an indicator of acute MI; the level begins to increase within a few hours and peaks within 24 hours of an infarct.</p>
<p class="h7">Myoglobin</p>
<p class="nonindent">Myoglobin is a heme protein that helps transport oxygen. Like the CK-MB enzyme, myoglobin is found in cardiac and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page740" title="740"></span>skeletal muscle. The myoglobin level starts to increase within 1 to 3 hours and peaks within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. An increase in myoglobin is not very specific in indicating an acute cardiac event; however, negative results can be used to rule out an acute MI.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s848">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of medical management are to minimize myocardial damage, preserve myocardial function, and prevent complications. These goals are facilitated by the use of guidelines developed by the ACC and the AHA (see <a href="#ct23-7">Chart 23-7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The goal for treating patients with acute MI is to minimize myocardial damage by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing oxygen supply with medications, oxygen administration, and bed rest. The resolution of pain and ECG changes indicate that demand and supply are in equilibrium; they may also indicate reperfusion. Visualization of blood flow through an open vessel in the catheterization laboratory is evidence of reperfusion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Initial Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with suspected MI should immediately receive supplemental oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine. Morphine is the drug of choice to reduce pain and anxiety. It also reduces preload and afterload, decreasing the work of the heart. The response to morphine is monitored carefully to assess for hypotension or decreased respiratory rate. Nurses should be aware that evolving research has suggested an association between morphine and potential adverse outcomes, including larger infarct size, increased length of hospital stay, and mortality, and should stay abreast of changes to clinical guidelines impacting its use (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1769">McCarthy, Bhambhani, Pomerantsev, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Neto, 2018</a>). A beta-blocker may also be used if arrhythmias occur. If a beta-blocker is not needed in the initial management period, it should be introduced within 24 hours of admission, once hemodynamics have stabilized and it is confirmed that the patient has no contraindications (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1761">Ibanez et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Unfractionated heparin or LMWH may also be prescribed along with platelet-inhibiting agents to prevent further clot formation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Emergent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with STEMI is taken directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for an immediate PCI (if a cardiac catheterization laboratory is on site). The procedure is used to open the occluded coronary artery and promote reperfusion to the area that has been deprived of oxygen. Superior outcomes have been reported with the use of PCI when compared to thrombolytic agents (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>) (also called <em>fibrinolytic</em> agents; see the Thrombolytics section). Thus, PCI is preferred as the initial treatment method for acute MI in all age groups (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The procedure treats the underlying atherosclerotic lesion. Because the duration of oxygen deprivation determines the number of myocardial cells that die, the time from the patient&#x2019;s arrival in the ED to the time PCI is performed should be less than 60 minutes. This is frequently referred to as door-to-balloon time. A cardiac catheterization laboratory and staff must be available if an emergent PCI is to be performed within this short time. The nursing care related to PCI is presented later in this chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Thrombolytics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Thrombolytic therapy is initiated when primary PCI is not available or the transport time to a PCI-capable hospital is too long. These agents are administered IV according to a specific protocol (see <a href="#ct23-8">Chart 23-8</a>). The thrombolytic agents used most often are alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. The purpose of <strong>thrombolytics</strong> is to dissolve (i.e., lyse) the thrombus in a coronary artery (thrombolysis), allowing blood to flow through the coronary artery again (reperfusion), minimizing the size of the infarction and preserving ventricular function. However, although thrombolytics may dissolve the thrombus, they do not affect the underlying atherosclerotic lesion. The patient may be referred for a cardiac catheterization and other invasive procedures following the use of thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytics should not be used if the patient is bleeding or has a bleeding disorder. They should be given within 30 minutes of symptom onset for best results (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). This is frequently referred to as door-to-needle time.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Inpatient Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Following PCI or thrombolytic therapy, continuous cardiac monitoring is indicated, preferably in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). Continuing pharmacologic management includes aspirin, a beta-blocker, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. In the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page741" title="741"></span>absence of angiotensin II, the blood pressure decreases and the kidneys excrete sodium and fluid (diuresis), decreasing the oxygen demand of the heart. The use of ACE inhibitors in patients after MI decreases mortality rates and prevents remodeling of myocardial cells that is associated with the onset of heart failure. Blood pressure, urine output, and serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels need to be monitored closely. If an ACE inhibitor is not suitable, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be prescribed (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1761">Ibanez et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Nicotine replacement therapy and tobacco cessation counseling should also be initiated for all tobacco users.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s849">Cardiac Rehabilitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After the patient with an MI is in a stable condition, an active rehabilitation program is initiated. Cardiac rehabilitation is an important continuing care program for patients with CAD that targets risk reduction by providing patient and family education, offering individual and group support, and encouraging physical activity and physical conditioning. The goals of rehabilitation for the patient who has had an MI are to extend life and improve the quality of life. The immediate objectives are to limit the effects and progression of atherosclerosis, return the patient to work and a pre-illness lifestyle, enhance the patient&#x2019;s psychosocial and vocational status, and prevent another cardiac event. Cardiac rehabilitation programs increase survival, reduce recurrent events and the need for interventional procedures, and improve quality of life (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Dickins &#x0026; Braun, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Physical conditioning is achieved gradually over time. Many times, patients will &#x201C;overdo it&#x201D; in an attempt to achieve their goals too rapidly. Patients are observed for chest pain, dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, and palpitations and are instructed to stop exercise if any of these occur. Patients may also be monitored for an increase in heart rate above the target heart rate, an increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of more than 20 mm Hg, a decrease in systolic blood pressure, onset or worsening of arrhythmias, or ST-segment changes on the ECG.</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiac rehabilitation programs are categorized into three phases (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Dickins &#x0026; Braun, 2017</a>). Phase I begins with the diagnosis of atherosclerosis, which may occur when the patient is admitted to the hospital for ACS. Because of brief hospital lengths of stay, mobilization occurs early and patient education focuses on the essentials of self-care rather than instituting behavioral changes for risk reduction. Priorities for in-hospital education include the signs and symptoms that indicate the need to call 911 (seek emergency assistance), the medication regimen, rest&#x2013;activity balance, and follow-up appointments with the primary provider. The patient is reassured that although CAD is a lifelong disease and must be treated as such, they can likely resume a normal life after an MI. The amount and type of activity recommended at discharge depend on the patient&#x2019;s age, his or her condition before the cardiac event, the extent of the disease, the course of the hospital stay, and the development of any complications.</p>
<p class="indent">Phase II occurs after the patient has been discharged. The patient attends sessions three times a week for 4 to 6 weeks but may continue for as long as 6 months. The outpatient program consists of supervised, often ECG-monitored, exercise training that is individualized. At each session, the patient is assessed for the effectiveness of and adherence to the treatment. To prevent complications and another hospitalization, the cardiac rehabilitation staff alerts the referring primary provider to any problems. Phase II cardiac rehabilitation also includes educational sessions for patients and families that are given by cardiologists, exercise physiologists, dietitians, nurses, and other health care professionals. These sessions may take place outside a traditional classroom setting. For instance, a dietitian may take a group of patients to a grocery store to examine labels and meat selections or to a restaurant to discuss menu offerings for a heart-healthy diet.</p>
<p class="indent">Phase III is a long-term outpatient program that focuses on maintaining cardiovascular stability and long-term conditioning. The patient is usually self-directed during this phase and does not require a supervised program, although it may be offered. The goals of each phase build on the accomplishments of the previous phase.</p>

<p class="processppara">One of the most important aspects of care of the patient with ACS is the assessment. It establishes the patient&#x2019;s baseline, identifies the patient&#x2019;s needs, and helps determine the priority of those needs. Systematic assessment includes a careful history, particularly as it relates to symptoms: chest pain or discomfort, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), palpitations, unusual fatigue, syncope (faintness), or other possible indicators of myocardial ischemia. Each symptom must be evaluated with regard to time, duration, and the factors that precipitate the symptom and relieve it, and in comparison with previous symptoms. A focused physical assessment is critical to detect complications and any change in patient status. <a href="#ct23-6">Chart 23-6</a> identifies important assessments and possible findings.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Two IV lines are typically placed for any patient with ACS to ensure that access is available for administering emergency medications. Medications are administered IV to achieve rapid onset and to allow for timely adjustment. After the patient&#x2019;s condition stabilizes, IV lines may be changed to a saline lock to maintain IV access.</p>

<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pulmonary edema (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Heart failure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cardiogenic shock (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>)</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include relief of pain or ischemic signs (e.g., ST-segment changes) and symptoms, prevention of myocardial damage, maintenance of effective respiratory function, maintenance or attainment of adequate tissue perfusion, reduced anxiety, adherence to the self-care program, and early recognition of complications. Care of the patient with ACS who has an uncomplicated MI is summarized in the Plan of Nursing Care (see <a href="#ct23-9">Chart 23-9</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">ELIEVING</span> P<span class="small">AIN AND</span> O<span class="small">THER</span> S<span class="small">IGNS AND</span> S<span class="small">YMPTOMS OF</span> I<span class="small">SCHEMIA</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Balancing myocardial oxygen supply with demand (e.g., as evidenced by the relief of chest pain) is the top priority in the care of the patient with an ACS. Although administering medications as described previously is required to accomplish this goal, nursing interventions are also important. Collaboration among the patient, nurse, and primary provider is critical in evaluating the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy and in altering the interventions accordingly.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Oxygen should be given along with medication therapy to assist with relief of symptoms. Administration of oxygen raises the circulating level of oxygen to reduce pain associated with low levels of myocardial oxygen. The route of administration (usually by nasal cannula) and the oxygen flow rate are documented. A flow rate of 2 to 4 L/min is usually adequate to maintain oxygen saturation levels of at least 95% unless chronic pulmonary disease is present.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Vital signs are assessed frequently as long as the patient is experiencing pain and other signs or symptoms of acute ischemia. Physical rest in bed with the head of the bed elevated or in a supportive chair helps decrease chest discomfort and dyspnea. Elevation of the head and torso is beneficial for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Tidal volume improves because of reduced pressure from abdominal contents on the diaphragm and better lung expansion.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Drainage of the upper lung lobes improves.</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Venous return to the heart (preload) decreases, reducing the work of the heart.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The pain associated with an acute MI reflects an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply and demand or ineffective myocardial tissue perfusion. The pain also results in increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Promptly relieving the pain helps to reestablish this balance, thus decreasing the workload of the heart and minimizing damage to the myocardium. Relief of pain also helps to reduce the patient&#x2019;s anxiety level, which in turn reduces the sympathetic stress response, leading to a decrease in workload of the already stressed heart.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<span class="small">MPROVING</span> R<span class="small">ESPIRATORY</span> F<span class="small">UNCTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Regular and careful assessment of respiratory function detects early signs of pulmonary complications. The nurse monitors fluid volume status to prevent fluid overload and encourages the patient to breathe deeply and change position frequently to maintain effective ventilation throughout the lungs. Pulse oximetry guides the use of oxygen therapy.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> A<span class="small">DEQUATE</span> T<span class="small">ISSUE</span> P<span class="small">ERFUSION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Bed or chair rest during the initial phase of treatment helps reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. This limitation on mobility should remain until the patient is pain free and hemodynamically stable. Skin temperature and peripheral pulses must be checked frequently to monitor tissue perfusion.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small">EDUCING</span> A<span class="small">NXIETY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Alleviating anxiety and decreasing fear are important nursing functions that reduce the sympathetic stress response. Less sympathetic stimulation decreases the workload of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page743" title="743"></span>heart, which may relieve pain and other signs and symptoms of ischemia.</p>

<p class="processpparapindentt1">The development of a trusting and caring relationship with the patient is critical in reducing anxiety. Providing information to the patient and family in an honest and supportive manner encourages the patient to be a partner in care and greatly assists in developing a positive relationship. Other interventions that can be used to reduce anxiety include ensuring a quiet environment, preventing interruptions that disturb sleep, and providing spiritual support consistent with the patient&#x2019;s beliefs. The nurse provides frequent opportunities for the patient to privately share concerns and fears. An atmosphere of acceptance helps the patient know that these concerns and fears are both realistic and normal. Alternative therapies such as pet therapy can help certain patients relax and reduce anxiety (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1782">Waite, Hamilton, &#x0026; O&#x2019;Brien, 2018</a>). Many hospitals have developed infection control and safety procedures pertaining to the animals, their handlers, and the patients eligible for pet therapy.</p>

<p class="processppara">Complications that can occur after acute MI are caused by the damage that occurs to the myocardium and to the conduction system from reduced coronary blood flow. Because these complications can be life-threatening, close monitoring for and early identification of their signs and symptoms are critical (see <a href="#ct23-9">Chart 23-9</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse monitors the patient closely for changes in cardiac rate and rhythm, heart sounds, blood pressure, chest pain, respiratory status, urinary output, skin color and temperature, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page745" title="745"></span>mental status, ECG changes, and laboratory values. Any changes in the patient&#x2019;s condition must be reported promptly to the primary provider and emergency measures instituted when necessary.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <span class="yellon">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The most effective way to increase the probability that the patient will implement a self-care regimen after discharge is to identify the patient&#x2019;s priorities, provide adequate education about heart-healthy living, and facilitate the patient&#x2019;s involvement in a cardiac rehabilitation program (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1761">Ibanez et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Patient participation in the development of an individualized program enhances the potential for an effective treatment plan (see <a href="c23-sec06.xhtml#ct23-10">Chart 23-10</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4n"><span class="yellon">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Depending on the patient&#x2019;s condition and the availability of family assistance, home, community-based, or transitional, care may be indicated. The nurse making a home visit can assist the patient with scheduling and keeping follow-up appointments and with adhering to the prescribed cardiac rehabilitation regimen. The patient may need reminders about follow-up monitoring, including periodic laboratory testing, as well as ongoing assessment of cardiac status. In addition, the home health nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s adherence to dietary restrictions and to prescribed medications. If the patient is receiving home oxygen, the nurse ensures that the patient is using the oxygen as prescribed and that appropriate home safety measures are maintained. If the patient has evidence of heart failure secondary to an MI, appropriate home care guidelines for the patient with heart failure are followed (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
