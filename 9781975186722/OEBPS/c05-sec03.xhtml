<h4 class="h4" id="s79">Stress at the Cellular Level</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The cell exists on a continuum of function and structure, ranging from the normal cell, to the adapted cell, to the injured or diseased cell, to the dead cell (<a href="c05-sec02.xhtml#ff5-3">Fig.&#x00A0;5-3</a>). Changes from one state to another may occur rapidly and may not be readily detectable, because each state does not have discrete boundaries, and disease represents disruption of normal processes. The earliest changes occur at the molecular or subcellular level and are not perceptible until steady-state functions or structures are altered. With cell injury, some changes may be reversible; in other instances, the injuries are lethal. For example, tanning of the skin is an adaptive, morphologic response to exposure to the rays of the sun. However, if the exposure is continued, sunburn and injury occur, and some cells may die, as evidenced by desquamation (&#x201C;peeling&#x201D;).</p>
<p class="indent">Different cells and tissues respond to stimuli with different patterns and rates of response, and some cells are more vulnerable to one type of stimulus or stressor than others. The cell involved, its ability to adapt, and its physiologic state are determinants of the response. For example, cardiac muscle cells respond to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypoxia:&lt;/b&gt; inadequate supply of oxygen to the cell">hypoxia</button></strong> (inadequate cellular oxygenation) more quickly than do smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Other determinants of cellular response are the type or nature of the stimulus, its duration, and its severity. For example, neurons that control respiration can develop a tolerance to regular, small amounts of a barbiturate; however, one large dose may result in respiratory depression and death.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s80">Control of the Steady State</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The concept of the cell as existing on a continuum of function and structure includes the relationship of the cell to compensatory mechanisms, which occur continuously in the body to maintain the steady state. Compensatory processes are regulated primarily by the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system, with control achieved through negative feedback.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Negative Feedback</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;negative feedback:&lt;/b&gt; mechanisms that monitor the internal environment and restore homeostasis when conditions shift out of the normal range">Negative feedback</button></strong> mechanisms throughout the body monitor the internal environment and restore homeostasis when conditions shift out of the normal range. These mechanisms sense deviations from a predetermined set point or range of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page105" title="105"></span>adaptability and trigger a response to offset the deviation. Functions regulated through such compensatory mechanisms include blood pressure, acid&#x2013;base balance, blood glucose level, body temperature, and fluid and electrolyte balance.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the human body&#x2019;s control systems are integrated by the brain with feedback from the nervous and endocrine systems. Control activities involve detecting deviations from the predetermined reference point and stimulating compensatory responses in the muscles and glands of the body. The major organs affected are the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. When stimulated, these organs alter their rate of activity or the amount of secretions they produce. Because of this, these major organs are considered the &#x201C;<em>organs of homeostasis or adjustment</em>&#x201D; (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the responses influenced by the nervous and endocrine systems, local responses consisting of small feedback loops in a group of cells or tissues occur. The cells detect a change in their immediate environment and initiate an action to counteract its effect. For example, the accumulation of lactic acid in an exercised muscle stimulates dilation of blood vessels in the area to increase blood flow and improve the delivery of oxygen and removal of waste products.</p>
<p class="indent">The net result of negative feedback loops is homeostasis. A steady state is achieved by the continuous, variable action of the organs involved in making the adjustments and by the continuous exchange of chemical substances among cells, interstitial fluid, and blood. For example, an increase in the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration of the extracellular fluid leads to increased pulmonary ventilation, which decreases the CO<sub>2</sub> level. On a cellular level, increased CO<sub>2</sub> raises the hydrogen ion concentration of the blood. This is detected by chemosensitive receptors in the brain&#x2019;s medullary respiratory control center. The chemoreceptors then stimulate an increase in the rate of discharge of the neurons that innervate the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which increases the respiratory rate. Excess CO<sub>2</sub> is exhaled, the hydrogen ion concentration returns to normal, and the chemically sensitive neurons are no longer stimulated (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Positive Feedback</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Another type of feedback, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;positive feedback:&lt;/b&gt; mechanisms that perpetuate a chain of events">positive feedback</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, perpetuates the chain of events set in motion by the original disturbance instead of compensating for it. As the system becomes more unbalanced, disorder and disintegration occur. There are some exceptions to this; blood clotting in humans, for example, is an important positive feedback mechanism.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s81">Cellular Adaptation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cells are complex units that dynamically respond to the changing demands and stresses of daily life. They possess a maintenance function and a specialized function. The maintenance function refers to the activities that the cell performs with respect to itself; specialized functions are those that the cell performs in relation to the tissues and organs of which it is a part. Individual cells may cease to function without posing a threat to the organism. However, as the number of dead cells increases, the specialized functions of the tissues are altered and health is threatened.</p>
<p class="indent">Cells can adapt to environmental stress through structural and functional changes. Some of these adaptations include cellular atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia. Such adaptations reflect changes in the normal cell in response to stress (<a href="#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>A). If the stress is unrelenting, cellular injury and death may occur.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Atrophy</strong> can be the consequence of disease, decreased use, decreased blood supply, loss of nerve supply, or inadequate nutrition. Disuse of a body part is often associated with the aging process and immobilization. Cell size and organ size decrease (<a href="#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>B), and the structures principally affected are the skeletal muscles, the secondary sex organs, the heart, and the brain.</p>
<p class="indent">Atrophy and <strong>hypertrophy</strong> lead to changes in the size of cells (<a href="#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>C) and hence the size of the organs they form. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page106" title="106"></span>Compensatory hypertrophy is the result of an enlarged muscle mass and commonly occurs in skeletal and cardiac muscle that experiences a prolonged, increased workload. One example is the bulging muscles of an athlete.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hyperplasia:&lt;/b&gt; an increase in the number of new cells in an organ or tissue">Hyperplasia</button></strong> is an increase in the number of new cells in an organ or tissue (<a href="#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>D). As cells multiply and are subjected to increased stimulation, the tissue mass enlarges. This mitotic response (a change occurring with mitosis) is reversible when the stimulus is removed. This distinguishes hyperplasia from neoplasia or malignant growth, which continues after the stimulus is removed. Hyperplasia may be hormonally induced. An example is the increased size of the thyroid gland caused by thyroid-stimulating hormone (secreted from the pituitary gland) when a deficit in thyroid hormone occurs.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;metaplasia:&lt;/b&gt; a cell transformation in which one type of mature cell is converted into another type of cell">Metaplasia</button></strong> is a cell transformation in which one type of mature cell is converted into another type of cell (<a href="#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>E). This serves a protective function, because less-transformed cells are more resistant to the stress that stimulated the change. For example, the ciliated columnar epithelium lining the bronchi of people who smoke is replaced by squamous epithelium. The squamous cells can survive; loss of the cilia and protective mucus, however, can have damaging consequences.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysplasia:&lt;/b&gt; bizarre cell growth resulting in cells that differ in size, shape, or arrangement from other cells of the same tissue type">Dysplasia</button></strong> is bizarre cell growth resulting in cells that differ in size, shape, or arrangement from other cells of the same tissue type (<a href="#ff5-4">Fig.&#x00A0;5-4</a>F). Dysplastic cells have a tendency to become malignant; dysplasia is seen commonly in epithelial cells in the bronchi of people who smoke or use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s82">Cellular Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Injury</em> is defined as a disorder in steady-state regulation. Any stressor that alters the ability of the cell or system to maintain optimal balance of its adjustment processes leads to injury. Structural and functional damage then occurs, which may be reversible (permitting recovery) or irreversible (leading to disability or death). Homeostatic adjustments are concerned with the small changes within the body&#x2019;s systems. With adaptive changes, compensation occurs, and a new steady state may be achieved. With injury, steady-state regulation is lost and changes in functioning ensue.</p>
<p class="indent">Causes of disorder and injury in the system (cell, tissue, organ, body) may arise from the external or internal environment (<a href="#ff5-5">Fig.&#x00A0;5-5</a>) and include hypoxia, nutritional imbalance, physical agents, chemical agents, infectious agents, immune mechanisms, and genetic defects. The most common causes are hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), chemical injury, and infectious agents. In addition, the presence of one injury makes the system more susceptible to another injury. For example, inadequate oxygenation and nutritional deficiencies make the system vulnerable to infectious agents. These agents damage or destroy the integrity of the cell membrane (necessary for ionic balance) as well as the cell&#x2019;s ability to do the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Transform energy (aerobic respiration, production of adenosine triphosphate)</span></li>
<li><span>Synthesize enzymes and other necessary proteins</span></li>
<li><span>Grow and reproduce (genetic integrity)</span></li></ul>

Excesses or deficits of information and matter may occur, or there may be faulty regulation of processing.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Hypoxia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoxia interferes with the cell&#x2019;s ability to transform energy. Hypoxia may be caused by a decrease in blood supply to an area, a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (decreased hemoglobin), a ventilation&#x2013;perfusion or respiratory problem that reduces the amount of arterial oxygen available, or a problem in the cell&#x2019;s enzyme system that makes it unable to use oxygen.</p>
<p class="indent">The usual cause of hypoxia is ischemia or deficient blood supply. Ischemia is commonly seen in myocardial cell injury in which arterial blood flow is decreased because of atherosclerotic narrowing of blood vessels. Ischemia also results from intravascular clots (thrombi or emboli) that may form and interfere with blood supply. Thromboemboli are common causes of cerebrovascular disease (strokes). The length of time in which different tissues can survive without oxygen varies. For example, brain cells most often succumb in 3 to 6 minutes. If the condition leading to hypoxia is slow and progressive, collateral circulation may develop, whereby blood is supplied by other blood vessels in the area. However, this mechanism is not highly reliable.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Imbalance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nutritional imbalance refers to a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. This may be manifested as undernutrition (inadequate consumption of food or calories) or overnutrition (caloric excess). Caloric excess to the point of obesity overloads cells in the body with lipids. By requiring more energy to maintain the extra tissue, obesity places a strain on the body and has been associated with the development of disease, especially pulmonary and cardiovascular disease as well as several types of cancer. (See <a href="c42.xhtml">Chapter 42</a> for further discussion of obesity.)</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 106</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page107" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="107">p. 107</span></div>
<p class="indent">Specific deficiencies arise when an essential nutrient is deficient or when a nutrient imbalance exists. Protein deficiencies and avitaminosis (deficiency of vitamins) are typical examples. An energy deficit leading to cell injury can occur if there is insufficient glucose or insufficient oxygen to transform the glucose into energy. A lack of insulin, or the inability to use insulin, may also prevent glucose from entering the cell from the blood. This occurs in diabetes, a metabolic disorder that can lead to nutritional deficiency, as well as a host of short- and long-term life-threatening complications. (See <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a> for further discussion of diabetes.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Physical Agents</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Physical agents, including temperature extremes, radiation, electrical shock, and mechanical trauma, can cause injury to the cells or to the entire body. The duration of exposure and the intensity of the stressor determine the severity of damage.</p>
<p class="h7">Temperature</p>
<p class="nonindent">When a person&#x2019;s temperature is elevated, hypermetabolism occurs and the respiratory rate, heart rate, and basal metabolic rate increase. With fever induced by infections, the hypothalamic thermostat may be reset at a higher temperature and then return to normal when the fever abates. The increase in body temperature is achieved through physiologic mechanisms. Body temperatures greater than 41&#x00B0;C (106&#x00B0;F) indicate hyperthermia, because the physiologic function of the thermoregulatory center breaks down and the temperature soars (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>). This physiologic condition occurs in people who have heatstroke. Eventually, the high temperature causes coagulation of cell proteins, and cells die.</p>
<p class="indent">The local response to burn injury is similar. Increased metabolic activity occurs, and, as heat increases, proteins coagulate and enzyme systems are destroyed. In extreme situations, charring or carbonization occurs. See <a href="c57.xhtml">Chapter 57</a> for more information about burn injuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Extreme low environmental temperature (cold) causes vasoconstriction. Blood flow becomes sluggish and clots form, leading to ischemic damage in the involved tissues. With still lower temperatures, ice crystals may form and cells may burst.</p>
<p class="h7">Radiation and Electrical Shock</p>
<p class="nonindent">Radiation is used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Ionizing forms of radiation may cause injury by their destructive action. Radiation decreases the protective inflammatory response of the cell, creating a favorable environment for opportunistic infections. Electrical shock produces burns as a result of the heat generated when electrical current travels through the body. It may also abnormally stimulate nerves, leading, for example, to fibrillation of the heart.</p>
<p class="h7">Mechanical Trauma</p>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical trauma can result in wounds that disrupt the cells and tissues of the body. The severity of the wound, amount of blood loss, and extent of nerve damage are significant factors in determining the extent of injury.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chemical Agents</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chemical injuries are caused by poisons, such as lye, that have a corrosive action on epithelial tissue, or by heavy metals, such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, each of which has its own specific destructive action. Many other chemicals are toxic in certain amounts, in certain people, and in specific tissues. For example, excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid can damage the stomach lining; large amounts of glucose can cause osmotic shifts, affecting the fluid and electrolyte balance; and too much insulin can cause subnormal levels of glucose in the blood (hypoglycemia) and can lead to coma.</p>
<p class="indent">Drugs, including prescribed medications, can also cause chemical poisoning. Some people are less tolerant of medications than others and manifest toxic reactions at the usual or customary dosages. Aging tends to decrease tolerance to medications. Polypharmacy (taking many medications at one time) occurs frequently in older adults, and the unpredictable effects of the resulting medication interactions can cause injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Alcohol (ethanol) is also a chemical irritant. In the body, alcohol is broken down into acetaldehyde, which has a direct toxic effect on liver cells that leads to various liver abnormalities, including cirrhosis in susceptible people. Disordered liver cell function leads to complications in other organs of the body.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infectious Agents</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Biologic agents known to cause disease in humans are viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. The severity of the infectious disease depends on the number of microorganisms entering the body, their virulence, and the host&#x2019;s defenses (e.g., health, age, immune responses; see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a> for further discussion of infectious diseases).</p>
<p class="indent">An infection exists when the infectious agent is living, growing, and multiplying in the tissues and is able to overcome the body&#x2019;s normal defenses. Some bacteria, such as those that cause tetanus and diphtheria, produce exotoxins that circulate and create cell damage. Others, such as gram-negative bacteria, produce endotoxins when they die. Tubercle bacilli induce an immune reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Viruses are among the smallest living organisms known and survive as parasites of the living cells they invade. Viruses infect specific cells. Through a complex mechanism, viruses replicate within cells and then invade other cells, where they continue to replicate. As the body mounts an immune response to eliminate the viruses, cells harboring the viruses can be injured in the process. Typically, an inflammatory response and immune reaction are the body&#x2019;s physiologic responses to viral infection.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Disordered Immune Responses</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The immune system is an exceedingly complex system, the purpose of which is to defend the body from invasion by any foreign object or foreign cell type, such as cancerous cells. This is a steady-state mechanism; however, like other adjustment processes, it can become disordered and cellular injury results. The immune response detects foreign bodies by distinguishing non-self substances from self substances and destroying the non-self entities. The entrance of an antigen (foreign substance) into the body evokes the production of antibodies that attack and destroy the antigen (antigen&#x2013;antibody reaction).</p>
<p class="indent">The immune system may function normally, or it may be hypoactive or hyperactive. When it is hypoactive, immune deficiency diseases occur; when it is hyperactive, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page108" title="108"></span>hypersensitivity disorders occur. A disorder of the immune system can result in damage to the body&#x2019;s own tissues. Such disorders are labeled autoimmune diseases (see Unit 7).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Genetic Disorders</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There is intense interest in genetic defects as causes of disease and modifiers of genetic structure. Many of these defects produce mutations that have no recognizable effect, such as lack of a single enzyme; others contribute to more obvious congenital abnormalities, such as Down syndrome. (For further information on genetics, see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s83">Cellular Response to Injury: Inflammation <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></h5>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be869e49c81b" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Acute Inflammation</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cells or tissues of the body may be injured or killed by any of the agents (physical, chemical, infectious) described earlier. When this happens, an inflammatory response (or inflammation) naturally occurs in the healthy tissues adjacent to the site of injury. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;inflammation:&lt;/b&gt; a localized reaction of tissue to injury, irritation, or infection that is manifested by five cardinal signs of redness, warmth, swelling, pain, and loss of function">Inflammation</button></strong> is a localized reaction intended to neutralize, control, or eliminate the offending agent to prepare the site for repair. It is a nonspecific response (not dependent on a particular cause) that is meant to serve a protective function. For example, inflammation may be observed at the site of a bee sting, in a sore throat, in a surgical incision, and at the site of a burn. Inflammation also occurs in cell injury events, such as stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and myocardial infarction.</p>
<p class="indent">Inflammation is not the same as infection. An infectious agent is only one of several agents that may trigger an inflammatory response. Regardless of the cause, a general sequence of events occurs in the local inflammatory response. This sequence involves changes in the microcirculation, including vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and leukocytic cellular infiltration (<a href="#ff5-6">Fig.&#x00A0;5-6</a>). As these changes take place, five cardinal signs of inflammation are produced: redness, warmth, swelling, pain, and loss of function (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The transient vasoconstriction that occurs immediately after injury is followed by vasodilation and an increased rate of blood flow through the microcirculation to the area of tissue damage. Local warmth and redness result. Next, the structure of the microvascular system changes to accommodate the movement of plasma protein from the blood into the tissues. Following this increase in vascular permeability, plasma fluids (including proteins and solutes) leak into the inflamed tissues, producing swelling. Leukocytes migrate through the endothelium and accumulate in the tissue at the site of the injury. The pain that occurs is attributed to the pressure of fluids or swelling on nerve endings and to the irritation of nerve endings by chemical mediators released at the site. Bradykinin is one of the chemical mediators suspected of causing pain. Loss of function is most likely related to the pain and swelling; however, the exact mechanism is not completely known.</p>
<p class="indent">As blood flow increases and fluid leaks into the surrounding tissues, the formed elements (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) remain in the blood, causing it to become more viscous. Leukocytes (white blood cells) collect in the vessels, exit, and migrate to the site of injury to engulf offending organisms and to remove cellular debris in a process called <em>phagocytosis.</em> Fibrinogen in the leaked plasma fluid coagulates, forming fibrin for clot formation, which serves to wall off the injured area and prevent the spread of infection.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Chemical Mediators of Inflammation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Injury initiates the inflammatory response; however, chemical substances released at the site induce vascular changes. Foremost among these chemicals are histamine and kinins. Histamine is present in many tissues of the body but is concentrated in the mast cells. It is released when injury occurs and is responsible for the early changes in vasodilation and vascular permeability. Kinins cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, and they attract neutrophils to the area. Prostaglandins&#x2014;another group of chemical substances&#x2014;are also suspected of causing increased vascular permeability (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Systemic Response to Inflammation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The inflammatory response is often confined to the site, causing only local signs and symptoms. However, systemic responses can also occur. Fever is the most common sign of a systemic response to injury, and it is most likely caused by endogenous pyrogens (internal substances that cause fever) released from neutrophils and macrophages (specialized forms of leukocytes). These substances reset the hypothalamic thermostat, which controls body temperature, and produce fever. Leukocytosis, an increase in the synthesis and release of neutrophils from bone marrow, may occur, enhancing the body&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page109" title="109"></span>ability to fight infection. During this process, general, nonspecific symptoms develop, including malaise, loss of appetite, aching, and weakness.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Types of Inflammation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Inflammation is categorized primarily by its duration and the type of exudate produced. It is most often acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is characterized by the local vascular and exudative changes described previously and usually lasts less than 2 weeks. An acute inflammatory response is immediate and serves a protective function. After the causative agent is removed, the inflammation subsides and healing takes place with the return of normal or near-normal structure and function.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic inflammation develops if the injurious agent persists and the acute response is perpetuated. Symptoms are present for many months or years. Chronic inflammation may also begin insidiously and never have an acute phase. The chronic response does not serve a beneficial and protective function; on the contrary, it is debilitating and can produce long-lasting effects. As the inflammation becomes chronic, changes occur at the site of injury, and the nature of the exudate becomes proliferative. A cycle of cellular infiltration, necrosis, and fibrosis begins, with repair and breakdown occurring simultaneously. Considerable scarring may occur, resulting in permanent tissue damage.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s84">Cellular Healing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The reparative process begins at approximately the same time as the injury. Healing proceeds after the inflammatory debris has been removed. Healing may occur by regeneration, in which the defect is gradually repaired by proliferation of the same type of cells as those destroyed, or by replacement, in which cells of another type, usually connective tissue, fill in the tissue defect and result in scar formation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regeneration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ability of cells to regenerate depends on whether they are labile, permanent, or stable. Labile cells multiply constantly to replace cells worn out by normal physiologic processes; these include epithelial cells of the skin and those lining the gastrointestinal tract. Permanent cells include neurons&#x2014;the nerve cell bodies, not their axons. Destruction of neurons is permanent; however, axons may regenerate. If normal activity is to return, tissue regeneration must occur in a functional pattern, especially in the growth of several axons. Stable cells in some organ systems have a latent ability to regenerate. Under normal physiologic processes, they are not shed and do not need replacement; if they are damaged or destroyed, they are able to regenerate. Examples include functional cells of the kidney, liver, and pancreas. Cells in other organs, such as the brain, do not regenerate.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Replacement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The condition of the host, the environment, and the nature and severity of the injury affect the processes of inflammation, repair, and replacement. Depending on the extent of damage, repair and replacement may occur by primary or secondary intention. In primary intention healing, the wound edges are approximated, as in a surgical wound (see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>). Little scar formation occurs, and the wound healing occurs without granulation. In secondary intention healing, there is tissue loss so the edges are not approximated and the wound fills with granulation tissue (<a href="c05-sec05.xhtml#bib349">Norris, 2019</a>). The process of repair takes longer and may result in scar formation, with loss of specialized function. For example, people who have recovered from myocardial infarction have abnormal electrocardiographic tracings because the electrical signal cannot be conducted through the connective tissue that has replaced the infarcted area.</p>
