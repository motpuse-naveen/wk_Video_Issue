<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;menopause:&lt;/b&gt; permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from the loss of ovarian follicular activity">Menopause</button></strong> is the permanent physiologic cessation of menses associated with declining ovarian function evidenced by 12 consecutive months with no menstrual bleeding (<a href="#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Most women stop menstruating between 41 and 59 years of age. Postmenopause is the period beginning from about 1 year after menses cease. Due to a decrease in estrogen levels, menopause may be associated with some atrophy of breast tissue and genital organs, loss in bone density, and vascular changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Menopause starts gradually and is usually signaled by changes in menstruation. The monthly flow may increase or decrease, become irregular, and finally cease. Often, the interval between periods is longer; a lapse of several months between periods is not uncommon. Ovulation occurs less frequently, estrogen levels fluctuate, and FSH levels increase in an attempt to stimulate estrogen production (<a href="#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2325">Postmenopausal Bleeding</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bleeding 1 year after menses cease at menopause must be investigated, and a malignant condition must be considered until proven otherwise. A transvaginal ultrasound can be used to measure the thickness of the endometrial lining (<a href="#bib3684">Goodman, 2020</a>). The uterine lining in women who are postmenopausal should be thin because of low estrogen levels. A thicker lining warrants further evaluation by endometrial biopsy or a D&#x0026;C.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2326">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Menopause has systemic effects that include an increase in body fat and intra-abdominal deposition of body fat. Also, levels of total and LDL cholesterol increase. Hot flashes occur in many women going through menopause due to alterations in thermoregulation. Because of these hormonal changes, some women notice irregular menses, breast tenderness, and mood changes long before menopause occurs (<a href="#bib3684">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). The hot or warm flashes and night sweats reported by some women are thought to be caused by hormonal changes and denote vasomotor instability. They may vary in intensity from a barely perceptible warm feeling to a sensation of extreme warmth accompanied by profuse sweating, causing discomfort, sleep disturbances, and subsequent fatigue. Other physical changes may include increased bone loss (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Strategies for Women Approaching Menopause</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box15BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>An annual physical examination can help screen for problems and promote general health.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Changes in lifestyle (e.g., diet, activity) to promote health and wellness.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A nutritious diet (decrease fat and calories, increase fiber and whole grains) and weight control will enhance physical and emotional well-being.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Exercise for at least 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a week to maintain good health.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Involvement in outside activities is beneficial in reducing anxiety and tension.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize the following about sexual activity:</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sexual functioning may be enhanced at midlife.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Frequent sexual activity helps to maintain the elasticity of the vagina.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Contraception is advised until 1 year passes without menses.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Safer sex is important at any age.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Strategies and methods to prevent or manage potential problems:</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Hot flashes:</em> See primary provider to discuss hormone replacement therapy indications (lowest dose for shortest period of time) and alternative therapy (e.g., vitamin therapy, black cohosh, and other herbal preparations). Fatigue and stress may worsen hot flashes.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Itching or burning of vulvar areas:</em> See primary provider to rule out dermatologic abnormalities and, if appropriate, to obtain a prescription for a lubricating or hormonal cream.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Dyspareunia due to vaginal dryness:</em> Use a water-soluble lubricant, hormone cream, or contraceptive foam.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Decreased perineal muscle tone and bladder control:</em> Practice Kegel exercises daily (contract the perineal muscles as though stopping urination; hold for 5 to 10 seconds and release; repeat frequently during the day).</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Dry skin:</em> Use mild emollient skin cream and lotions to prevent dry skin.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Weight control:</em> Join a weight reduction support group such as Weight Watchers or a similar group if appropriate or consult a registered dietitian for guidance about the tendency to gain weight, particularly around the hips, thighs, and abdomen.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Osteoporosis:</em> Observe recommended calcium and vitamin D intake, including calcium supplements, if indicated, to slow the process of osteoporosis; avoid smoking, alcohol, and excessive caffeine, all of which increase bone loss. Perform weight-bearing exercises. Undergo bone density testing when appropriate.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Risk for urinary tract infection (UTI):</em> Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water daily as a possible way to reduce the incidence of UTI related to atrophic changes of the urethra.</p>
<p class="BoxBL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Vaginal bleeding:</em> Report any bleeding after 1 year of no menses to the primary provider <em>immediately, no matter how minimal.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The entire genitourinary system is affected by the reduced estrogen level. Changes in the vulvovaginal area may include a gradual thinning of pubic hair and a gradual shrinkage of the labia. Vaginal secretions decrease, and women may report dyspareunia. The vaginal pH increases during menopause, predisposing women to bacterial infections and atrophic vaginitis. Discharge, itching, and vulvar burning may result.</p>
<p class="indent">Some women report fatigue, forgetfulness, weight gain, irritability, trouble sleeping, feeling &#x201C;blue,&#x201D; and feelings of panic. Menopausal complaints need to be evaluated carefully because they may indicate other disorders. Most women have few problems and are relieved to be free from menstrual periods. Nurses should provide women with education and health promotion strategies appropriate for those approaching menopause (see <a href="#ct50-14">Chart&#x00A0;50-14</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2327">Psychological Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Women&#x2019;s reactions and feelings related to loss of reproductive capacity may vary. Some women may experience role confusion, whereas others experience a sense of sexual and personal freedom. Women may be relieved that the childbearing phase of their lives is over. Each woman&#x2019;s personal views about menopause and circumstances affect her response and must be considered on an individual basis. Nurses need to be sensitive to all possibilities and take their cues from the patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2328">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Women approaching menopause often have many concerns about their health. Some have concerns based on a family history of heart disease, osteoporosis, or cancer. Each woman needs to be as knowledgeable as possible about her health options and should be encouraged to discuss her concerns with her primary provider so that she can make an informed decision about managing menopausal symptoms and maintaining her health.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hormone Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">HT or menopausal hormonal therapy (previously referred to as hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) is medication that contains estrogen or estrogen and progestin together, to replace the ones the body is no longer making. HT is controversial but it is prescribed to treat moderate to severe menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) in women without contraindications to estrogen and progesterone whose quality of life is being affected (<a href="#bib3684">Martin &#x0026; Barbieri, 2019</a>). The current recommendation for treatment of hot flashes with HT is to use the lowest dose possible for the shortest time possible (<a href="#bib3684">Martin &#x0026; Barbieri, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Methods of Administration</p>
<p class="nonindent">Both estrogen and progestin are prescribed for women who have not had a hysterectomy; progestin prevents proliferation of the uterine lining and hyperplasia. Women who no longer have a uterus because of hysterectomy can take estrogen without progestin (i.e., unopposed estrogen) because there is no longer a risk of estrogen-induced hyperplasia of the uterine lining. Although there is a slight increase of risk of stroke in women taking estrogen alone following hysterectomy, the risk of breast cancer is unchanged (<a href="#bib3684">Martin &#x0026; Barbieri, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some women take both estrogen and progestin daily; others take estrogen for 25 consecutive days each month, with progestin taken in cycles (e.g., 10 to 14 days of the month). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1673" title="1673"></span>Women who take HT for 25 days often experience bleeding after completing the progestin. Other women take estrogen and progestin every day and usually experience no bleeding. They occasionally have irregular spotting, which should be evaluated by their primary provider. Progestin administration may be oral, transdermal, vaginal, or intrauterine.</p>
<p class="indent">Estrogen patches, which are replaced once or twice weekly, are another option but require a progestin along with them if the woman still has a uterus. Another type of patch provides estrogen and progestin treatment (<a href="#bib3684">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Skin should be dry at the area of application and cleansing the site with alcohol may improve adhesiveness. Vaginal treatment with an estrogen cream, suppository, or a vaginal ring may be used for vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, or atrophy (<a href="#bib3684">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Risks and Benefits</p>
<p class="nonindent">HT is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, vascular thrombosis, impaired liver function, uterine cancer, and undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding. The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased with HT (<a href="#bib3684">Martin &#x0026; Barbieri, 2019</a>). Women who elect to take HT should be educated about the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and instructed to report these signs and symptoms (i.e., leg redness, tenderness, chest pain, shortness of breath) immediately. Women who take HT need to be informed about the importance of regular follow-up care, including a yearly physical examination and mammograms as needed and age appropriate. An endometrial biopsy is indicated for any irregular bleeding. Because the risk of complications increases the longer HT is used, HT should be used for the shortest time possible (<a href="#bib3684">Martin &#x0026; Barbieri, 2019</a>). Estrogen alone or in combination with a progestin does not reduce the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Alternative Therapy for Hot Flashes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because women often seek information about alternatives to the use of HT, nurses must be knowledgeable about other approaches that women can use to promote their health in the peri- and postmenopausal periods. Problematic hot flashes have been treated with low-dose venlafaxine, psychoeducational approaches, and diet and lifestyle changes (<a href="#bib3684">Santen, Loprinzi, &#x0026; Casper, 2019</a>). Similarly, vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and vitamin E may be effective. Some women have expressed interest in other alternative treatments (e.g., natural estrogens and progestins, black cohosh, ginseng, dong quai, soy products, and several other herbal preparations); however, scant data exist about their safety or effectiveness. A few studies have shown some improvement in vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) with the use of complementary therapies. These include reflexology, aromatherapy, yoga, hypnotherapy, breathing exercises, and meditation (<a href="#bib3684">Santen et al., 2019</a>). When taking a medical history of a patient who is perimenopausal or menopausal, the nurse should always address their use of complementary and alternative therapies and supplements.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Bone Health</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acceleration of bone loss resulting in osteoporosis and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue occurs at menopause and leads to increased bone fragility and risk of fracture (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Cardiovascular Health</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A variety of strategies can help to lower the risk of heart disease in women, including lifestyle changes and behavioral strategies (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Behavioral Strategies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As stated previously, regular physical exercise is beneficial. It may also reduce stress, enhance well-being, and improve self-image. In addition, weight-bearing exercise may prevent loss of muscle tissue and bone tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">Women are also encouraged to participate in other health-promoting activities. These include regular health screening recommended for women at the time of menopause: gynecologic examinations, mammograms, colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and bone mineral density testing if at risk for osteoporosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Women are encouraged to decrease their fat and caloric intake and increase their intake of whole grains, fibers, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2329">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses can encourage women to view menopause as a natural change resulting in freedom from symptoms related to menses. No relationship exists between menopause and mental health problems; however, social circumstances (e.g., adolescent children, ill partners, and dependent or ill parents) that may coincide with menopause can be stressful.</p>
<p class="indent">Measures should be taken to promote general health. The nurse explains to the patient that cessation of menses is a normal occurrence that is rarely accompanied by nervous symptoms or illness. The current expected lifespan after menopause for the average woman is 30 to 35 years, which may encompass as many years as the childbearing phase of her life. Normal sexual urges continue, and women retain their usual response to sex long after menopause. Many women enjoy better health after menopause than before, especially those who have experienced dysmenorrhea. The individual woman&#x2019;s evaluation of herself and her worth, now and in the future, is likely to affect her emotional reaction to menopause. Patient education and counseling regarding healthy lifestyles, health promotion, and health screening are of paramount importance (<a href="#bib3684">Santen et al., 2019</a>).</p>
