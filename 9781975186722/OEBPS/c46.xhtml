<h3 class="h3">GLOSSARY</h3>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">diabetes:</span> a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA):</span> a metabolic derangement, most commonly occurring in type 1 diabetes, that results from a deficiency of insulin; highly acidic ketone bodies are formed, resulting in acidosis</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">fasting plasma glucose (FPG):</span> blood glucose determination obtained in the laboratory after fasting for at least 8&#x00A0;hours</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">gestational diabetes:</span> any degree of glucose intolerance with its onset during pregnancy</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">glycated hemoglobin:</span> a measure of glucose control that is a result of glucose molecule attaching to hemoglobin for the life of the red blood cell (120 days) (<em>synonyms</em>: glycosylated hemoglobin, HgbA<sub>1C</sub>, or A1C)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">glycemic index:</span> the amount a given food increases the blood glucose level compared with an equivalent amount of glucose</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hyperglycemia:</span> elevated blood glucose level</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS):</span> a metabolic disorder, most commonly of type 2 diabetes resulting from a relative insulin deficiency initiated by an illness that raises the demand for insulin</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypoglycemia:</span> low blood glucose level</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT):</span> a metabolic stage intermediate between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes; referred to as prediabetes</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">insulin:</span> a hormone secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas that is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats; a deficiency of insulin results in diabetes</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">ketone:</span> a highly acidic substance formed when the liver breaks down free fatty acids in the absence of insulin</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA):</span> a subtype of diabetes</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">medical nutrition therapy (MNT):</span> nutritional therapy prescribed for management of diabetes that usually is given by a registered dietitian</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">nephropathy:</span> a long-term complication of diabetes in which the kidney cells are damaged; characterized by microalbuminuria in early stages and progressing to end-stage kidney disease</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">neuropathy:</span> a long-term complication of diabetes resulting from damage to the nerve cell</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">prediabetes:</span> impaired glucose metabolism in which blood glucose concentrations fall between normal levels and those considered diagnostic for diabetes; includes impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, not clinical entities in their own right but risk factors for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">retinopathy:</span> a condition that occurs when the small blood vessels that nourish the retina in the eye are damaged</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG):</span> a method of capillary blood glucose testing</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">type 1 diabetes:</span> a metabolic disorder characterized by an absence of insulin production and secretion from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas (<em>formerly</em>: insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile diabetes)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">type 2 diabetes:</span> a metabolic disorder characterized by the relative deficiency of insulin production and a decreased insulin action and increased insulin resistance (<em>formerly:</em> non&#x2013;insulin-dependent diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes)</p>

Care of the patient with diabetes, formerly known as diabetes mellitus but now more commonly referred to as diabetes, requires an understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic testing, medical and nursing care, and rehabilitation of patients with diabetes. The field of diabetes is dynamic with constant advances in technology, research, and medications that can improve the life and well-being of people with diabetes. Nurses care for patients with diabetes in all settings. This chapter focuses on the nursing management of patients with diabetes.</p>
