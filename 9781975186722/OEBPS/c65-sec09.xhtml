<h4 class="h4" id="s3106">Muscular Dystrophies</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The muscular dystrophies are a group of incurable muscle disorders characterized by progressive weakening and wasting of the skeletal or voluntary muscles with 30 different types to date. Most of these diseases are inherited. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common and severe type, occurs in 1 of every 3500 male births (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Norris, 2019</a>). The pathologic features include degeneration and loss of muscle fibers, variation in muscle fiber size, phagocytosis and regeneration, and replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue. The common characteristics of these diseases include varying degrees of muscle wasting and weakness and abnormal elevation in serum levels of muscle enzymes. Differences among these diseases center on the genetic pattern of inheritance, the muscles involved, the age at onset, and the rate of disease progression. The symptoms can be diverse and may include muscle stiffness or weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, or cardiomyopathy. Prognosis depends on the type of muscular dystrophy. Regardless of age of onset, this disease varies in progression (Birnkrant, Bushby, Bann, et al., 2018b). The unique needs of these patients, who in the past did not live to adulthood, must be addressed, as they are living longer because of better supportive care and the emergence of disease modifying therapies (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4493">Birnkrant et al., 2018b; Trout, Case, Clemens, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3107">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of the muscular dystrophies focuses on supportive care and prevention of complications in the absence of a cure (Birnkrant et al., 2018b). The goal of supportive management is to keep the patient active and functioning as normally as possible and to minimize functional deterioration. An individualized therapeutic exercise program is prescribed to prevent muscle tightness, contractures, and disuse atrophy. Night splints and stretching exercises are used to delay contractures of the joints, especially the ankles, knees, and hips. Braces may compensate for muscle weakness.</p>
<p class="indent">Spinal deformity is a severe problem. Weakness of trunk muscles and spinal collapse occur almost routinely in patients with severe neuromuscular disease. To help prevent spinal deformity, the patient is fitted with an orthotic jacket to improve sitting stability and reduce trunk deformity. This measure also supports cardiovascular status. In time, spinal fusion is performed to maintain spinal stability. Other procedures may be carried out to correct deformities.</p>
<p class="indent">Compromised pulmonary function may result either from progression of the disease or from deformity of the thorax secondary to severe scoliosis (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Trout et al., 2018</a>). Upper respiratory infections and fractures from falls must be vigorously treated in a way that minimizes immobilization because joint contractures become worse when the patient&#x2019;s activities are more restricted than usual.</p>
<p class="indent">Other difficulties may manifest in relation to the underlying disease. Weakness of the facial muscles makes it difficult to attend to dental hygiene and to speak clearly, and impairs the ability to swallow safely (Birnkrant, Bushby, Bann, et al., 2018a). Gastrointestinal tract problems may include gastric dilation, rectal prolapse, and fecal impaction. Finally, cardiomyopathy appears to be a common complication in all forms of muscular dystrophy (Birnkrant et al., 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Genetic counseling is advised for parents and siblings of the patient because of the genetic nature of this disease. The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) works to combat neuromuscular disease through research, programs of patient services and clinical care, and professional and public education (see the Resources section).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3108">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of the patient and the nurse are to maintain function at optimal levels and to enhance the quality of life. Therefore, the patient&#x2019;s physical requirements, which are considerable, are addressed without losing sight of emotional and developmental needs. The patient and family are actively involved in decision making, including end-of-life decisions (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During hospitalization for treatment of complications, the knowledge and expertise of the patient and family members responsible for caregiving in the home are assessed. Because the patient and family caregivers often have developed caregiving strategies that work effectively for them, these strategies need to be acknowledged and accepted, and provisions must be made to ensure that they are maintained during hospitalization (Birnkrant et al., 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Families of adolescents and young adults with muscular dystrophy need assistance to shift the focus of care from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2133" title="2133"></span>pediatric to adult care and to understand the usual disease course (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Lindsay, Cagliostro, &#x0026; McAdam, 2019</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Trout et al., 2018</a>). Nursing goals include assisting the adolescent to make the transition to adult values and expectations while providing age-appropriate ongoing care. The nurse may need to help build the confidence of an older adolescent or adult patient by encouraging them to pursue job training to become economically independent. Other nursing interventions might include guidance in accessing adult health care and finding appropriate programs in sex education.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7a"><img class="ex2" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Management goals are addressed in special rehabilitation programs or in the patient&#x2019;s home and community. Therefore, the patient and family require information and education about the disorder, its anticipated course, and care and management strategies that will optimize the patient&#x2019;s growth and development and physical and psychological status. Members of a variety of health-related disciplines are involved in patient and family education; recommendations are communicated to all members of the health care team so that they may work toward common goals.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Both the neuromuscular disease and the associated deformities may progress in adolescence and adulthood. Self-help and assistive devices can aid in maintaining maximum independence. These devices, recommended by physical and occupational therapists, often become necessary as more muscle groups are affected.</p>
<p class="indent">The family is instructed to monitor the patient for respiratory problems, because respiratory infection and cardiac failure are the most common causes of death. As respiratory difficulties develop, patients and their families need information regarding respiratory support. Options currently exist that can provide ventilatory support (e.g., negative-pressure devices, positive-pressure ventilators) while allowing mobility (Birnkrant et al., 2018a). Patients can remain relatively independent in a wheelchair, for example, while being maintained on a ventilator at home for many years.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is encouraged to continue with range-of-motion exercises to prevent contractures, which are particularly disabling. Practical adaptations must be made, however, to cope with the effects of chronic neuromuscular disability. The patient at various stages of the disease may require a manual or an electric wheelchair, gait aids, upper and lower extremity and spinal orthotics, seating systems, bathroom equipment, lifts, ramps, and additional assistive devices, all of which require a team approach. The nurse assesses how the patient and family are managing, makes referrals, and coordinates the activities of the physical therapist, occupational therapist, and social services.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who express concerns about increasing disability and dependence on others, as well as significant deterioration in health-related quality of life, benefit from an interprofessional approach to care (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Trout et al., 2018</a>). The patient is faced with a progressive loss of function, leading eventually to death. Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness are common. Each functional loss is accompanied by grief and mourning. The patient and family are assessed for depression, anger, or denial. The patient and family are assisted and encouraged to address decisions about end-of-life options before their need arises (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A psychiatric nurse clinician or other mental health professional may assist the patient to cope and adapt to the disease. By understanding and addressing clinical concerns that are important for patients and their families, while at the same time assessing caregiver knowledge and burden during every encounter, the nurse provides a hopeful, supportive, and nurturing environment.</p>
