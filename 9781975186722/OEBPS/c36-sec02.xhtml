<h4 class="h4" id="s1431">Common Upper Extremity Disorders</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The structures in the upper extremities are frequently the sites of painful syndromes. This is especially true in occupational health settings, where many patient visits involve the shoulder, wrist, and hand.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1432">Bursitis and Tendonitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bursitis and tendonitis are inflammatory conditions that commonly occur in the shoulder. Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that prevent friction between joint structures during joint activity and are painful when inflamed; <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bursitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of a fluid-filled sac in a joint">bursitis</button></strong> is the consequence when these sacs become inflamed. Muscle tendon sheaths also become inflamed with repetitive stretching, causing <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tendonitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of muscle tendons">tendonitis</button></strong>. The inflammation causes proliferation of synovial membrane and pannus formation, which restricts joint movement. Conservative treatment includes rest of the extremity, intermittent ice and heat to the joint, and NSAIDs to control the inflammation and pain. Newer therapies that include extracorporeal shock waves, pulsed magnetic fields, laser phototherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and stem cell therapies are touted to accelerate tendon healing, although further research is needed to determine their overall effectiveness (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Cook &#x0026; Young, 2020</a>). There are no non&#x2013;research-based sites for injection of cellular therapies that are registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Cook &#x0026; Yong, 2020</a>). The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for sports allows autologous (self-donated) localized injections for soft tissue injuries, but IV infusions are prohibited (WADA, 2020). Arthroscopic synovectomy may be considered if shoulder pain and weakness persist. Corticosteroid injections remain more evidence based than most other interventions for short-term, rapid improvement, but are not always helpful in the long term (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2593">McAlindon, LaValley, Harvey, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Most tendon and bursal inflammatory problems are self-limiting; they go away on their own with or without therapy. The treatments are primarily aimed at pain relief, not cure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1433">Loose Bodies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Loose bodies (&#x201C;joint mice&#x201D;) may occur in a joint space as a result of articular cartilage wear and bone erosion. These fragments can interfere with joint movement (&#x201C;locking the joint&#x201D;). Loose bodies are removed by arthroscopic surgery if they cause pain or mobility issues.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1434">Impingement Syndrome</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Impingement syndrome</em> is a general term that describes impaired movement of the rotator cuff of the shoulder. Impingement usually occurs from repetitive overhead movement of the arm or from acute trauma resulting in irritation and eventual inflammation of the rotator cuff tendons or the subacromial bursa as they grate against the coracoacromial arch. Early manifestations of this syndrome are characterized by edema from hemorrhage of these structures, pain, shoulder tenderness, limited movement, muscle spasm, and eventual disuse atrophy. The process may progress to a partial or complete rotator cuff tear (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>).</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Measures to Promote Shoulder Healing of Impingement Syndrome</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Rest the joint in a position that minimizes stress on the joint structures to prevent further damage and the development of adhesions.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Support the affected arm on pillows while sleeping to keep from turning onto the shoulder.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Gradually resume motion and use of the joint. Assistance with dressing and other activities of daily living may be needed.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid working and lifting above shoulder level or pushing an object against a &#x201C;locked&#x201D; shoulder.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perform the prescribed daily range-of-motion and strengthening exercises.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Medications used to treat early impingement syndrome include oral NSAIDs or intra-articular injections of corticosteroids. Application of superficial cold or heat may subjectively improve patients&#x2019; symptoms; however, a therapeutic exercise program (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>) is required to improve outcomes, including reduction of pain and improved shoulder function (see <a href="#ct36-3">Chart 36-3</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1435">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy that occurs when the median nerve at the wrist is compressed by a thickened flexor tendon sheath, skeletal encroachment, edema, or a soft tissue mass. It frequently occurs in women between 30 and 60 years of age. Women going through menopause or who are taking estrogen or birth control pills have the highest risk (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Calandruccio &#x0026; Thompson, 2018</a>). While carpal tunnel syndrome is commonly caused by repetitive hand and wrist movements, it is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes, acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, or trauma (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). People employed in occupations that require frequent repetitive hand movements or flexing of the wrist, such as assembly line workers and hairdressers, and those exposed to vibration when doing tasks, such as construction workers and machinists, may be at increased risk for carpal tunnel syndrome (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Calandruccio &#x0026; Thompson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient experiences pain, numbness, paresthesia, and, possibly, weakness along the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, and middle fingers). Night pain and/or fist clenching upon awakening is common. A positive Tinel sign helps identify patients requiring intervention (see <a href="#ff36-4">Fig. 36-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence-based treatment of acute carpal tunnel syndrome includes oral or intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, use of NSAIDs and acupuncture with and without electrical stimulation (attached to the needles). Application of splints to prevent hyperextension and prolonged flexion of the wrist is also effective; however, laser and ultrasound therapies are ineffective, as are prolotherapies, or the injection of substances (e.g., dextrose, lidocaine) purported to stimulate healing, diuretics, and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Calandruccio &#x0026; Thompson, 2018</a>). The risks of inhibiting the synthesis of reparative substrates like collagen can potentiate an increased risk for tendon rupture; therefore, long-term use of corticosteroids is not supported (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2593">McAlindon et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Traditional open nerve release or endoscopic laser surgery are the two most common surgical management options when nonsurgical treatments fail. Both of these procedures are performed under local anesthesia and involve making incisions into the affected wrist and cutting the carpal ligament so that the carpal tunnel is widened. Smaller incisions are made with the endoscopic laser procedure, resulting in less scar formation and a shorter recovery time than with the open method. Following either procedure, the patient wears a hand splint and limits hand use during healing. The patient may need assistance with personal care. Full recovery of motor and sensory function after either type of nerve release surgery may take several weeks or months.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1436">Ganglion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A ganglion&#x2014;a collection of neurologic gelatinous material near the tendon sheaths and joints&#x2014;appears as a round, firm, cystic swelling, usually on the dorsum of the wrist. It frequently occurs in women younger than 50 years (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). The swelling is locally tender and may cause an aching pain. When a tendon sheath is involved, weakness of the finger occurs. Treatment may include aspiration, corticosteroid injection, or surgical excision. After treatment, a compression dressing and immobilization splint are used; however, a ganglion may recur after medical intervention (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2559">De Keyser, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1437">Dupuytren Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dupuytren disease results in a slowly progressive <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;contracture:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal shortening of muscle, joint, or both; fibrosis">contracture</button></strong> (i.e., an abnormal shortening) of the palmar fascia that causes flexion of the fourth, fifth, and, sometimes, middle finger, rendering these fingers more or less useless (see <a href="#ff36-5">Fig. 36-5</a>). It is linked to an inherited autosomal dominant trait and occurs most frequently in men of Scandinavian or Celtic heritage who are older than 50 years (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). Dupuytren disease is also associated with arthritis, diabetes, gout, cigarette smoking, and alcoholism (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2547">Ball, Izadi, Verjee, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Starting as a nodule, it may or may not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1119" title="1119"></span>progress, producing a contracture of the fingers and palmar skin changes. The patient may experience dull and aching discomfort, morning numbness, and stiffness in the affected fingers. This condition starts in one hand, but eventually both are affected. Finger-stretching exercises in early disease or intranodular injections of corticosteroids or collagenases may prevent contractures (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2547">Ball et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). With loss of movement, palmar and digital fasciotomies are performed to improve function.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1438">Nursing Management of the Patient Undergoing Surgery of the Hand or Wrist</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery of the hand or wrist, unless related to major trauma, is generally an ambulatory procedure. Before surgery, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s level and type of discomfort, as well as limitations in function, caused by the condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Hourly neurovascular assessment of the exposed fingers for the first 24 hours following surgery is essential for monitoring function of the nerves and perfusion. This is especially important if an intraoperative tourniquet technique was used, which is implicated in neurovascular deficits. The nurse compares the affected extremity with the unaffected extremity and the postoperative status with the documented preoperative status. The nurse asks the patient to describe sensations in the digits and has the patient demonstrate mobility, while enforcing limitations in movement prescribed by the patient&#x2019;s surgeon. With tendon repairs and nerve, vascular, or skin grafts, more extensive function is tested (see <a href="c35.xhtml">Chapter 35</a>, <a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#ct35-3">Chart 35-3</a>). Percutaneous pins may be used to hold bones in position. These pins serve as potential sites of infection. Patient education concerning aseptic wound and pin care may be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Dressings provide support but should be nonconstrictive. Intermittent use of ice packs to the surgical area during the first 24 to 48 hours may be prescribed to control edema. Unless contraindicated, active extension and flexion of the fingers to promote circulation are encouraged, even though movement is limited by the bulky dressing.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, pain and discomfort can be controlled by the use of oral analgesic agents. Patient education concerning the risk of falls and impaired cognition is important. Pain out of proportion to what is expected, particularly if it is accompanied with compromised neurovascular functioning, needs to be evaluated as an indication of compartment syndrome (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>). Pain may be related to surgery, edema, hematoma formation, or restrictive bandages. To control swelling that may increase the patient&#x2019;s discomfort, the nurse instructs the patient to elevate the hand to heart level with pillows. If the patient is ambulatory, the arm is supported in a conventional sling with the hand elevated at heart level (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>, <a href="c37-sec08.xhtml#ff37-15">Fig. 37-15</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During the first few days after surgery, independent self-care is impaired. The patient may need to arrange for assistance with feeding, bathing, dressing, and toileting. Within a few days, the patient develops skills in one-handed ADLs and is usually able to function with minimal help and assistive devices. The nurse encourages the patient to use the involved hand, unless contraindicated, within the limits of discomfort. As rehabilitation progresses, the patient resumes use of the limb. Physical or occupational therapy&#x2013;directed exercises may be prescribed.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">After the patient has undergone surgery, the nurse instructs the patient how to monitor neurovascular status and the signs of complications that need to be reported to the surgeon (e.g., paresthesia, paralysis, uncontrolled pain, coolness of fingers, extreme swelling, excessive bleeding, purulent drainage, foul odor, fever). The nurse discusses prescribed medications and their side effects with the patient. In addition, the nurse instructs the patient how to elevate the extremity and to apply ice (if prescribed) to control swelling. The use of assistive devices is demonstrated if such devices would be helpful in promoting accomplishment of ADLs. For bathing, the nurse instructs the patient to keep the dressing dry by covering it with a secured plastic bag. Generally, the wound is not redressed until the patient&#x2019;s follow-up visit with the surgeon (see <a href="c36-sec03.xhtml#ct36-4">Chart 36-4</a>). The nurse identifies any perceived barriers to being able to attend to this plan (such as childcare needs). The patient is referred to community-based resources as appropriate.</p>
