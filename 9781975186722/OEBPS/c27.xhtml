<h3 class="h3">GLOSSARY</h3>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypertensive emergency:</span> an emergent situation in which blood pressure is severely elevated and there is evidence of actual or probable target organ damage</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">hypertensive urgency:</span> an urgent situation in which blood pressure is severely elevated but there is no evidence of impending or progressive target organ damage</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">isolated systolic hypertension:</span> a disorder most commonly seen in the older adult in which the systolic pressure is greater than 140 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure is less than 80 mm Hg</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">masked hypertension:</span> blood pressure that is typically suggestive of a diagnosis of hypertension that is paradoxically normal in health care settings</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">primary hypertension:</span> high blood pressure with no identifiable cause (<em>synonym:</em> essential hypertension)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">rebound hypertension:</span> blood pressure in a patient with hypertension that is controlled with medication and becomes abnormally high with the abrupt discontinuation of that medication</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">resistant hypertension:</span> high blood pressure treated with three or more antihypertensive medications of different classes; one of these must be a diuretic agent</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">secondary hypertension:</span> high blood pressure from an identified cause, such as chronic kidney disease</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">target organ damage:</span> manifestations of pathophysiologic changes in various organs as a consequence of hypertension</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">white coat hypertension:</span> blood pressure that increases to hypertensive readings in health care settings that is paradoxically within the normal ranges in other settings</p>

<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is the most common chronic disease among adults in the United States and in the world (Whelton, Carey, Aronow, et&#x00A0;al., 2017<em>).</em> It is identified as the leading risk factor for premature death, disability, and overall disease burden worldwide because it may lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when not appropriately treated (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2024">Caillon, Paradis, &#x0026; Schiffrin, 2019</a>; <a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib1997">DePalma, Himmelfarb, MacLaughlin, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>)<em>.</em> The overall risk of developing these CVDs, strokes, and renal disorders is low among patients with blood pressures that are consistently stable around 115/75 mm Hg; however, each increase of 20 mm Hg in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 10 mm Hg increase in the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) doubles the risk of death from stroke or heart disease (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2004">Lee, Kim, Kang, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). And yet, most patients with hypertension could lower their blood pressure through lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, medication adherence, smoking cessation) and lower these associated morbid risks (<a href="c27-sec02.xhtml#bib2015">Whelton et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). This chapter presents an overview of hypertension and how it is defined and managed so that nurses may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page866" title="866"></span>appropriately assess, monitor, educate, and intervene with patients with hypertension.</p>
