<h4 class="h4" id="s749">Cardiac Tamponade</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart resulting from fluid or blood within the pericardial sac. It usually is caused by blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest. A penetrating wound of the heart is associated with a high mortality rate. Cardiac tamponade also may follow diagnostic cardiac catheterization, angiographic procedures, and pacemaker insertion, which can produce perforations of the heart and great vessels. Pericardial effusion with fluid compressing the heart also may develop from metastases to the pericardium from malignant tumors of the breast, lung, or mediastinum and may occur with lymphomas and leukemias, kidney injury, TB, and high-dose radiation to the chest (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for a detailed discussion of cardiac tamponade).</p>
