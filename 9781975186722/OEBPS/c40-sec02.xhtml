<h4 class="h4" id="s1663">Peptic Ulcer Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Peptic ulcer disease affects approximately 4.6 million Americans annually, with the peak onset between 30 and 60 years of age (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). A peptic ulcer may be referred to as a gastric, duodenal, or esophageal ulcer, depending on its location. A peptic ulcer is an excavation (hollowed-out area) that forms in the mucosa of the stomach, in the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pylorus:&lt;/b&gt; opening between the stomach and the duodenum">pylorus</button></strong> (the opening between the stomach and duodenum), in the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;duodenum:&lt;/b&gt; first portion of the small intestine, between the stomach and the jejunum">duodenum</button></strong> (the first portion of the small intestine, between the stomach and the jejunum), or in the esophagus. Erosion of a circumscribed area of mucosa is the cause (<a href="#ff40-2">Fig. 40-2</a>). This erosion may extend as deeply as the muscle layers or through the muscle to the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;peritoneum:&lt;/b&gt; thin membrane that lines the inside of the wall of the abdomen and covers all of the abdominal organs">peritoneum</button></strong> (thin membrane that lines the inside of the wall of the abdomen) (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Peptic ulcers are more likely to occur in the duodenum than in the stomach. As a rule, they occur alone but they may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1271" title="1271"></span>occur in multiples. Chronic gastric ulcers tend to occur in the lesser curvature of the stomach, near the pylorus. Esophageal ulcers occur as a result of the backward flow of HCl from the stomach into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]).</p>

Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams &#x0026; Wilkins.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Women have 8% to 11% and men have an 11% to 14% lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>). The rates of peptic ulcer disease among middle-age men have diminished over the past several decades, whereas the rates among older adults have increased, particularly among women (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>). Those who are 65 years and older present to both outpatient and inpatient settings for treatment of peptic ulcers more than any other age group. This trend may be explained, at least in part, by higher rates of NSAID use and <em>H. pylori</em> infections in older adult populations (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In the past, stress and anxiety were thought to be causes of peptic ulcers, but research has documented that most peptic ulcers result from infection with <em>H. pylori,</em> which may be acquired through ingestion of food and water. Person-to-person transmission of the bacteria also occurs through close contact and exposure to emesis. Although <em>H. pylori</em> infection is common in the United States, most infected people do not develop ulcers. It is not known why <em>H. pylori</em> infection does not cause ulcers in all people, but most likely the predisposition to ulcer formation depends on certain factors, such as the type of <em>H. pylori</em> and other as yet unknown factors (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Santacroce &#x0026; Bhutani, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, represents a major risk factor for peptic ulcers. Studies report that both NSAIDs and <em>H. pylori</em> impair the protective gastric mucosa, and the failure of the GI tract to repair the mucosa may result in ulceration (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). It is believed that smoking and alcohol consumption may be risks, although the evidence is inconclusive (Anand, 2020; NIDDK, 2020c).</p>
<p class="indent">Familial tendency also may be a significant predisposing factor. People with blood type O are more susceptible to the development of peptic ulcers than are those with blood type A, B, or AB. There also is an association between peptic ulcer disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disorders (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Peptic ulcer disease is also associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). ZES is a rare condition in which benign or malignant tumors form in the pancreas and duodenum that secrete excessive amounts of the hormone gastrin (NIDDK, 2020d; Roy, 2019). The excessive amount of gastrin results in extreme gastric hyperacidity and severe peptic ulcer disease. While the exact cause of ZES is unknown, 25% to 30% of cases are linked to an inherited, genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN-1) (NIDDK, 2020b; Norris, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1664">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Peptic ulcers occur mainly in the gastroduodenal mucosa because this tissue cannot withstand the digestive action of gastric acid (HCl) and pepsin. The erosion is caused by the increased concentration or activity of acid&#x2013;pepsin or by decreased resistance of the normally protective mucosal barrier. A damaged mucosa cannot secrete enough mucus to act as a barrier against normal digestive juices. Exposure of the mucosa to gastric acid (HCl), pepsin, and other irritating agents (e.g., NSAIDs or <em>H. pylori</em>) leads to inflammation, injury, and subsequent erosion of the mucosa. Patients with duodenal ulcers secrete more acid than normal, whereas patients with gastric ulcers tend to secrete normal or decreased levels of acid. When the mucosal barrier is impaired, even normal or decreased levels of HCl may result in the formation of peptic ulcers.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of NSAIDs inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which is associated with a disruption of the normally protective mucosal barrier. Damage to the mucosal barrier also results in decreased resistance to bacteria, and thus infection from <em>H. pylori</em> bacteria may occur (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">ZES is suspected when a patient has several peptic ulcers or an ulcer that is resistant to standard medical therapy. It is identified by the following: hypersecretion of gastrin, duodenal ulcers, and gastrinomas (islet cell tumors) in the pancreas or duodenum. More than 80% of gastrinomas are found in the &#x201C;gastric triangle,&#x201D; which encompasses the cystic and common bile ducts, the second and third portions of the duodenum, and the junction of the head and body of the pancreas. Most gastrinomas tend to grow slowly; however, more than 50% of these tumors are malignant (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Bonheur &#x0026; Nachimuthu, 2019</a>). The patient with ZES may experience epigastric pain, pyrosis, diarrhea, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;steatorrhea:&lt;/b&gt; fatty stool; typically malodorous with an oily appearance and floats in water">steatorrhea</button></strong> (fatty stools). Patients with ZES associated with MEN-1 syndrome may have coexisting pituitary or parathyroid tumors. ZES-associated MEN-1 syndrome is diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism; therefore, patients may exhibit signs of hypercalcemia for several years before MEN-1 is diagnosed (NIDDK, 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Stress ulcer</em> is the term given to the acute mucosal ulceration of the duodenal or gastric area that occurs after physiologically stressful events, such as burns, shock, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Clarke et al., 2020</a>). Stress ulcers, which are clinically different from peptic ulcers, are most common in patients following significant burn injuries, traumatic brain injury, or who require mechanical ventilation. Stress ulcers are believed to be a result of ischemia to gastric mucosa and alterations in the mucosa barrier (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2979">Clarke&#x00A0;et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). When the patient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1272" title="1272"></span>recovers, the lesions are reversed. This pattern is typical of stress ulceration.</p>
<p class="indent">Differences of opinion exist as to the actual cause of mucosal ulceration in stress ulcers. Usually, the ulceration results from a disruption of the normally protective mucosal barrier and decreased mucosal blood flow (ischemia). Mucosal ischemia results in the reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach, which increases exposure of the unprotected gastric mucosa to the digestive effects of gastric acid (HCl) and pepsin (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Clarke et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). The combination of mucosal ischemia and increased gastric acid and pepsin exposure creates an ideal climate for ulceration.</p>
<p class="indent">Specific types of ulcers that result from stressful conditions include Curling ulcers and Cushing ulcers. Curling ulcer is frequently observed after extensive burn injuries and often involves the antrum of the stomach or the duodenum (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>). Cushing ulcer is common in patients with a traumatic head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or following intracranial surgery. Cushing ulcer is thought to be caused by increased intracranial pressure, which results in overstimulation of the vagal nerve and an increased secretion of gastric acid (HCl) (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). Cushing ulcers are typically deep, single ulcerations and have increased risk of perforation (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1665">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease may last for a few days, weeks, or months and may disappear only to reappear, often without an identifiable cause. Many patients with peptic ulcers have no signs or symptoms. These s<em>ilent peptic ulcers</em> most commonly occur in older adults and those taking aspirin and other NSAIDs (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As a rule, the patient with an ulcer complains of dull, gnawing pain or a burning sensation in the mid epigastrium or the back. There are few clinical manifestations that differentiate gastric ulcers from duodenal ulcers; however, classically, the pain associated with gastric ulcers most commonly occurs immediately after eating, whereas the pain associated with duodenal ulcers most commonly occurs 2 to 3 hours after meals. In addition, approximately 50% to 80% of patients with duodenal ulcers awake with pain during the night, whereas 30% to 40% of patients with gastric ulcers voice this type of complaint. Patients with duodenal ulcers are more likely to express relief of pain after eating or after taking an antacid than patients with gastric ulcers (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other nonspecific symptoms of either gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers may include pyrosis, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and bleeding. These symptoms are often accompanied by sour eructation (burping), which is common when the patient&#x2019;s stomach is empty.</p>
<p class="indent">Although vomiting is rare in an uncomplicated peptic ulcer, it may be a symptom of a complication of an ulcer. It results from gastric outlet obstruction, caused by either muscular spasm of the pylorus or mechanical obstruction from scarring or acute swelling of the inflamed mucous membrane adjacent to the ulcer. Vomiting may or may not be preceded by nausea; usually, it follows a bout of severe pain and bloating, which is relieved by vomiting. Emesis may contain undigested food eaten many hours earlier. Constipation or diarrhea may occur, probably as a result of diet and medications.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with bleeding peptic ulcers may present with evidence of GI bleeding, such as hematemesis or the passage of melena (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>). Approximately 20% of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers do not experience abdominal pain at the time of diagnosis (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). Peptic ulcer perforation results in the sudden onset of signs and symptoms. The patient often reports severe, sharp upper abdominal pain, which may be referred to the shoulder; extreme abdominal tenderness; and nausea or vomiting. Hypotension and tachycardia may occur, indicating the onset of shock (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Azer, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1666">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A physical examination may reveal pain, epigastric tenderness, or abdominal distention. Upper endoscopy is the preferred diagnostic procedure because it allows direct visualization of inflammatory changes, ulcers, and lesions. Through endoscopy, a biopsy of the gastric mucosa and any suspicious lesions can be obtained. Endoscopy may reveal lesions that, because of their size or location, are not evident on x-ray studies. <em>H. pylori</em> infection may be determined by endoscopy and histologic examination of a tissue specimen obtained by biopsy, or a rapid urease test of the biopsy specimen. Other less invasive diagnostic measures for detecting <em>H. pylori</em> include serologic testing for antibodies against the <em>H. pylori</em> antigen, stool antigen test, and urea breath test (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who has a bleeding peptic ulcer may require periodic CBCs to determine the extent of blood loss and whether or not blood transfusions are advisable (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>). Stools may be tested periodically until they are negative for occult blood. Gastric secretory studies are of value in diagnosing ZES and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;achlorhydria:&lt;/b&gt; lack of hydrochloric acid in digestive secretions of the stomach">achlorhydria</button></strong> (lack of HCl), hypochlorhydria (low levels of HCl), or hyperchlorhydria (high levels of HCl).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1667">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Once the diagnosis is established, the patient is informed that the condition can be managed. Recurrence may develop; however, peptic ulcers treated with antibiotics to eradicate <em>H. pylori</em> have a lower recurrence rate than those not treated with antibiotics. The goals are to eradicate <em>H. pylori</em> as indicated and to manage gastric acidity. Methods used include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgical intervention.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Currently, the most commonly used therapy for peptic ulcers is a combination of antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and sometimes bismuth salts that suppress or eradicate <em>H. pylori.</em> Recommended combination drug therapy is typically prescribed for 10 to 14 days and may include triple therapy with two antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole or amoxicillin and clarithromycin) plus a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., lansoprazole, omeprazole, or rabeprazole), or quadruple therapy with two antibiotics (metronidazole and tetracycline) plus a proton pump inhibitor and bismuth salts (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Marcus &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>). Research is currently being conducted to develop a vaccine against <em>H. pylori</em> (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2990">Liu, Zhong, Chen, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">H<sub>2</sub> blockers and proton pump inhibitors that reduce gastric acid secretion are used to treat ulcers not associated with <em>H. pylori</em> infection. <a href="#tt40-3">Table 40-3</a> provides information about the medication regimens for peptic ulcer disease.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The patient is advised to adhere to and complete the medication regimen to ensure complete healing of the ulcer. The patient also is advised to avoid the use of NSAIDs. Because most patients become symptom free within a week, the nurse stresses to the patient the importance of following the prescribed regimen so that the healing process can continue uninterrupted and the return of chronic ulcer symptoms can be prevented. Maintenance dosages of H<sub>2</sub> blockers are usually recommended for 1 year.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with ZES, hypersecretion of gastrin stimulates the release of gastric acid (HCl), which may be controlled with proton pump inhibitors. Octreotide, a medication that suppresses gastrin levels, also may be prescribed (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2981">Daniels, Khalili, Morano, et al., 2019</a>). Patients with ZES will require periodic endoscopy to evaluate the effectiveness of medication therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients at high risk for stress ulcers (e.g., patients who are mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours) may be treated prophylactically with either H<sub>2</sub> blockers or proton pump inhibitors, and cytoprotective agents (e.g., misoprostol, sucralfate) because of the increased risk of upper GI tract hemorrhage (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Clarke et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3011">Young, Bagshaw, Forbes, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Smoking Cessation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Smoking decreases the secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas into the duodenum, resulting in increased acidity of the duodenum. Continued smoking is also associated with delayed healing of peptic ulcers (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Berkowitz et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Kennedy &#x0026; Winter, 2017</a>). Therefore, the patient is encouraged to stop smoking. Refer to <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for information on how the nurse may promote cessation of tobacco use.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Dietary Modification</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The intent of dietary modification for patients with peptic ulcers is to avoid oversecretion of acid and hypermotility in the GI tract. These can be minimized by avoiding extremes of temperature in food and beverages and overstimulation from the consumption of alcohol, coffee (including decaffeinated coffee, which also stimulates acid secretion), and other caffeinated beverages. In addition, an effort is made to neutralize acid by eating three regular meals a day. Small, frequent feedings are not necessary as long as an antacid or an H<sub>2</sub> blocker is taken. Diet compatibility becomes an individual matter: The patient eats foods that are tolerated and avoids those that produce pain.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The introduction of antibiotics to eradicate <em>H. pylori</em> and of proton pump inhibitors as treatment for ulcers results in ulcer healing in approximately 85% to 90% of patients (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>). However, surgery is usually recommended for patients with intractable ulcers (those failing to heal after 12 to 16&#x00A0;weeks of medical treatment), life-threatening hemorrhage, perforation, or obstruction and for those with ZES that is unresponsive to medications (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Bonheur &#x0026; Nachimuthu, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Upchurch, 2019</a>). Surgical procedures include vagotomy, with or without <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pyloroplasty:&lt;/b&gt; surgical procedure to increase the opening of the pyloric orifice">pyloroplasty</button></strong> (transecting nerves that stimulate acid secretion and opening the pylorus), and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;antrectomy:&lt;/b&gt; removal of the pyloric (antrum) portion of the stomach with anastomosis (surgical connection) either to the duodenum (gastroduodenostomy or Billroth I) or to the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy or Billroth II)">antrectomy</button></strong>, which is removal of the pyloric (antrum) portion of the stomach with anastomosis (surgical connection) to either the duodenum (gastroduodenostomy or Billroth I) or jejunum (gastrojejunostomy or Billroth II) (<a href="#tt40-4">Table 40-4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Surgery may be performed using a traditional open abdominal approach (requiring a long abdominal incision) or through the use of laparoscopy (only requiring small abdominal incisions). Laparoscopy is a type of minimally invasive surgery that involves the indirect visualization of the abdominal cavity through the use of a laparoscope (a thin flexible tube) attached to a camera. The laparoscope is placed into the abdomen through small &#x201C;keyhole&#x201D; incisions (0.5 to 1.5 cm in length). Laparoscopy has been associated with decreased postoperative bleeding, pain, infection, respiratory complications, and recovery time (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2982">Davenport, Ueland, Kumar, et al., 2019</a>). The choice of using an open abdominal approach or laparoscopy is determined by the surgeon&#x2019;s preference and expertise as well as clinical factors, such as the patient&#x2019;s current health status; the presence of coexisting medical conditions; and a history of previous abdominal surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Follow-Up Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Recurrence of peptic ulcer disease within 1 year may be prevented with the prophylactic use of H<sub>2</sub> blockers taken at a reduced dose. Not all patients require maintenance therapy; it may be prescribed only for those with two or three recurrences per year, those who have had a complication such as bleeding or gastric outlet obstruction, or those for whom gastric surgery poses too high a risk. The likelihood of recurrence is reduced if the patient avoids smoking, coffee (including decaffeinated coffee) and other caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and ulcerogenic medications (e.g., NSAIDs).</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse asks the patient to describe the pain, its pattern and whether or not it occurs predictably (e.g., after meals, during the night), and strategies used to relieve it (e.g., food, antacids). If the patient reports a recent history of vomiting, the nurse determines how often emesis has occurred and notes important characteristics of the vomitus: Is it bright red, does it resemble coffee grounds, or is there undigested food from previous meals? Has the patient noted any bloody or tarry stools?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse also asks the patient to list their usual food intake for a 72-h period. Lifestyle and other habits are a concern as well. For example, do they smoke cigarettes? If yes, how many? Do they use any type of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)? If yes, what type and how often? Does the patient ingest alcohol? If yes, how much and how often? Are NSAIDs used? Is there a family history of ulcer disease?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and reports tachycardia and hypotension, which may indicate anemia from GI bleeding. The stool is tested for occult blood, and a physical examination, including palpation of the abdomen for localized tenderness, is performed.</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Pain relief can be achieved with prescribed medications. The patient should avoid NSAIDs, aspirin in particular, as well as alcohol. In addition, meals should be eaten at regularly paced intervals in a relaxed setting. Medications prescribed to treat the peptic ulcer should provide relief of ulcer-associated pain. Some patients benefit from learning relaxation techniques to help manage stress and pain.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s level of anxiety. Explaining diagnostic tests and administering medications as scheduled help reduce anxiety. The nurse interacts with the patient in a relaxed manner; helps identify stressors; and explains various coping techniques and relaxation methods, such as biofeedback, hypnosis, or behavior modification. The patient&#x2019;s family is also encouraged to participate in care and to provide emotional support.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> O<small>PTIMAL</small> N<small>UTRITIONAL</small> S<small>TATUS</small></strong></p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Hemorrhage.</span> Gastritis and hemorrhage from peptic ulcer are the two most common causes of upper GI tract bleeding (which may also occur with esophageal varices, as discussed in <a href="c43.xhtml">Chapter 43</a>). Hemorrhage in patients with duodenal ulcers is associated with an approximately 5% mortality rate (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>). Bleeding peptic ulcers account for 27% to 40% of all upper GI bleeds and it may be manifested by hematemesis or melena (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Upchurch, 2019</a>). The vomited blood can be bright red, or it can have a dark coffee grounds appearance from the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. When the hemorrhage is large (2000 to 3000 mL), most of the blood is vomited. Because large quantities of blood may be lost quickly, immediate correction of blood loss may be required to prevent hemorrhagic shock. When the hemorrhage is small, much or all of the blood is passed in the stools, which appear tarry black because of the digested hemoglobin. Management depends on the amount of blood lost and the rate of bleeding.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses the patient for faintness or dizziness and nausea, which may precede or accompany bleeding. The nurse must monitor vital signs frequently and evaluate the patient for tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. Other nursing interventions include monitoring the hemoglobin and hematocrit, testing the stool for gross or occult blood, and recording hourly urinary output to detect anuria or oliguria (absence of or decreased urine production).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Many times, the bleeding from a peptic ulcer stops spontaneously; however, the incidence of recurrent bleeding is high. Because bleeding can be fatal, the cause and severity of the hemorrhage must be identified quickly, and the blood loss treated to prevent hemorrhagic shock. The nurse monitors the patient carefully so that bleeding can be detected quickly. Patients suspected of having an ulcer who present with symptoms of acute GI bleeding should undergo evaluation with endoscopy within 12 h to confirm the diagnosis and allow targeted endoscopic interventions (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Upchurch, 2019</a>). These endoscopic interventions may include injecting the bleeding site with epinephrine or alcohol, or cauterizing the site, or clipping the ulcer, all in efforts to stop the bleeding (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Anand, 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Upchurch, 2019</a>). Arteriography with embolization may be needed if therapeutic endoscopy fails to control the bleeding (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3007">Spiliopoulos, Inchingolo, Lucatelli, et al., 2018</a>). If bleeding cannot be managed by these methods, surgery may be indicated, in which the area of the ulcer is removed, or the bleeding vessels are ligated. Many patients also undergo procedures (e.g., vagotomy and pyloroplasty, gastrectomy) aimed at controlling the underlying cause of the ulcers (see <a href="#tt40-4">Table 40-4</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">For patients who are not candidates for surgery or for those with persistent, severe bleeding despite medical and endoscopic treatment, arteriography with embolization may be indicated (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Spiliopoulos et al., 2018</a>). Arteriography with embolization is more commonly referred to as <em>Transcatheter Arterial Embolization</em> (TAE). TAE is an interventional radiologic procedure in which a catheter is placed percutaneously (through the skin) into an artery (e.g., femoral or brachial artery) and is advanced under use of fluoroscopy to the site of the bleeding peptic ulcer. An embolic agent is then delivered via the catheter, which selectively occludes blood flow to the bleeding vessel(s), and thus stops bleeding of the peptic ulcer. Common embolic agents used include metallic coils (a small metal device) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2992">Loffroy, Midulla, Falvo, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Spiliopoulos et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient with GI bleeding may require treatment for hemorrhagic shock. If that is the case, then the collaborative treatment guidelines described in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> must be followed (e.g., hemodynamic monitoring, IV line insertion for fluid resuscitation, blood component therapy). In addition, other related nursing and collaborative interventions may include inserting an NG tube to distinguish fresh blood from material resembling coffee grounds, to aid in the removal of clots and acid through administering a saline lavage, to prevent nausea and vomiting through suction decompression of gastric contents, and to provide a means of monitoring further bleeding.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Perforation and Penetration.</span> Perforation is the erosion of the ulcer through the gastric <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;serosa:&lt;/b&gt; thin membrane that covers the outer surface of the stomach; visceral peritoneum covering the outer surface of the stomach">serosa</button></strong> (thin membrane covering the outer surface of the stomach) into the peritoneal cavity without warning. It is an abdominal emergency and requires immediate surgery. Perforation occurs more commonly with duodenal ulcers than it does with gastric ulcers; however, in both cases, it is a very serious complication that can result in sepsis or multiorgan failure (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Azer, 2018</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>). Penetration is erosion of the ulcer through the gastric serosa into adjacent structures such as the pancreas, biliary tract, or gastrohepatic <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;omentum:&lt;/b&gt; fold of the peritoneum that surrounds the stomach and other organs of the abdomen">omentum</button></strong> (membranous fold of the peritoneum). Symptoms of penetration include back and epigastric pain not relieved by medications that were effective in the past. Like perforation, penetration usually requires surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Signs and symptoms of perforation include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sudden, severe upper abdominal pain (persisting and increasing in intensity); pain may be referred to the shoulders, especially the right shoulder, because of irritation of the phrenic nerve in the diaphragm</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Vomiting</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Collapse (fainting)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rMiddle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Extremely tender and rigid (boardlike) abdomen</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rLast"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hypotension and tachycardia, indicating shock</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1276</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1277" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1277">p. 1277</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Because chemical peritonitis develops within a few hours of perforation and is followed by bacterial peritonitis, the perforation must be closed as quickly as possible and the abdominal cavity lavaged of stomach or intestinal contents. In some patients, it may be safe and advisable to perform surgery to treat the ulcer disease in addition to suturing the perforation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">During surgery and postoperatively, the stomach contents are drained by means of an NG tube. The nurse monitors fluid and electrolyte balance and assesses the patient for localized infection or peritonitis (increased temperature, abdominal pain, paralytic ileus, increased or absent bowel sounds, abdominal distention). Antibiotic therapy is given as prescribed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="yellow">Gastric Outlet Obstruction.</span> Peptic ulcer disease is the leading benign (noncancerous) cause of gastric outlet obstruction (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Castellanos &#x0026; Podolsky, 2020</a>). Gastric outlet obstruction occurs when the area distal to the pyloric sphincter becomes scarred and stenosed from spasm or edema or from scar tissue that forms when an ulcer alternately heals and breaks down. The patient may have nausea and vomiting, constipation, epigastric fullness, anorexia, and, later, weight loss.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In treating the patient with gastric outlet obstruction, the first consideration is to insert an NG tube to decompress the stomach. Confirmation that obstruction is the cause of the discomfort is accomplished by assessing the amount of fluid aspirated from the NG tube. A residual of more than 400 mL suggests obstruction. Usually, an upper GI study or endoscopy is performed to confirm gastric outlet obstruction. Decompression of the stomach and management of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balances may improve the patient&#x2019;s condition and avert the need for surgical intervention. Balloon dilation of the pylorus via endoscopy may be beneficial. If the obstruction is unrelieved by medical management, surgery (in the form of a vagotomy and antrectomy or gastrojejunostomy and vagotomy) may be required.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The nurse educates the patient about the factors that relieve and those that aggravate the condition. The nurse reviews information about medications to be taken at home, including name, dosage, frequency, and possible side effects, stressing the importance of continuing to take medications even after signs and symptoms have decreased or subsided (<a href="c40-sec03.xhtml#ct40-2">Chart 40-2</a>). The patient is instructed to avoid medications and foods that exacerbate symptoms (e.g., NSAIDs, alcohol). If relevant, the nurse also informs the patient about the irritant effects of smoking on the ulcer and provides information about smoking cessation programs.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4">Continuing and Transitional Care. The nurse reinforces the importance of follow-up care; the need to report recurrence of symptoms; and the need for treating possible problems that occur after surgery, such as intolerance to specific foods. The patient and family are reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screening.</p>
