<h4 class="h4" id="s1995">Pheochromocytoma</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that is usually benign and originates from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. This tumor is the cause of high blood pressure in 0.1% of patients with hypertension and is usually fatal if undetected and untreated; however, it is usually cured by surgery. In 90% of patients the tumor arises in the medulla; in the remaining patients, it occurs in the extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue located in or near the aorta, ovaries, spleen, or other organs. Pheochromocytoma may occur at any age, but its peak incidence is between 40 and 50 years of age and affects men <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1475" title="1475"></span>and women equally (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2019). Ten percent of the tumors are bilateral, and 10% are malignant. Because of the high incidence of pheochromocytoma in family members of affected people, the patient&#x2019;s family members should be alerted and screened for this tumor. Pheochromocytoma may occur in the familial form as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2; therefore, it should be considered a possibility in patients who have medullary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid hyperplasia or tumor.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1996">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nature and severity of symptoms of functioning tumors of the adrenal medulla depend on the relative proportions of epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion. The typical triad of symptoms is headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations in the patient with hypertension. Hypertension and other cardiovascular disturbances are common. The hypertension may be intermittent or persistent. If the hypertension is sustained, it may be difficult to distinguish from other causes of hypertension. Other symptoms may include tremor, headache, flushing, and anxiety. Hyperglycemia may result from conversion of liver and muscle glycogen to glucose due to epinephrine secretion; insulin may be required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.</p>
<p class="indent">The clinical picture in the paroxysmal form of pheochromocytoma is usually characterized by acute, unpredictable attacks lasting seconds or several hours. Symptoms usually begin abruptly and subside slowly. During these attacks, the patient is extremely anxious, tremulous, and weak. The patient may experience headache, vertigo, blurring of vision, tinnitus, air hunger, and dyspnea. Other symptoms include polyuria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a feeling of impending doom. Palpitations and tachycardia are common (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>). Blood pressures exceeding 250/150&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg have been recorded. Such blood pressure elevations are life-threatening and can cause severe complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, dissecting aneurysm, stroke, and acute kidney failure. Orthostatic hypotension (decrease in systolic blood pressure, lightheadedness, dizziness on standing) occurs in 70% of patients with untreated pheochromocytoma.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1997">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pheochromocytoma is suspected if signs of sympathetic nervous system overactivity occur in association with marked elevation of blood pressure. These signs can be associated with the &#x201C;five Hs&#x201D;: <strong><em>h</em></strong>ypertension, <strong><em>h</em></strong>eadache, <strong><em>h</em></strong>yperhidrosis (excessive sweating), <strong><em>h</em></strong>ypermetabolism, and <strong><em>h</em></strong>yperglycemia. The presence of these signs is highly predictive of pheochromocytoma. Paroxysmal symptoms of pheochromocytoma commonly develop in the fifth decade of life.</p>
<p class="indent">Measurements of urine and plasma levels of catecholamines and metanephrine (MN), a catecholamine metabolite, are the most direct and conclusive tests for overactivity of the adrenal medulla. A test for detecting pheochromocytoma measures free MN in plasma by high-pressure liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. A negative test result virtually excludes pheochromocytoma. Measurements of catecholamine metabolites (MN and vanillylmandelic acid [VMA]) or free catecholamines have been extensively used in the clinical setting. In most cases, pheochromocytoma can be diagnosed or confirmed based on a properly collected 24-hour urine sample. Levels can be as high as two times the normal limit. A 24-hour urine specimen is collected to detect free catecholamines, MN, and VMA; the use of combined tests increases the diagnostic accuracy of testing. A number of medications and foods, such as coffee and tea (including decaffeinated varieties), bananas, chocolate, vanilla, and aspirin, may alter the results of these tests; therefore, careful instructions to avoid restricted items must be given to the patient. Urine collected over a 2- or 3-hour period after an attack of hypertension can be assayed for catecholamine content (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The total plasma catecholamine (epinephrine and norepinephrine) concentration is measured with the patient supine and at rest for 30 minutes. To prevent elevation of catecholamine levels resulting from the stress of venipuncture, a butterfly needle, scalp vein needle, or venous catheter may be inserted 30 minutes before the blood specimen is obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors that may elevate catecholamine concentrations must be controlled to obtain valid results; these factors include consumption of coffee or tea (including decaffeinated varieties), the use of tobacco, emotional and physical stress, and the use of many prescription and over-the-counter medications (e.g., amphetamines, nose drops or sprays, decongestant agents, bronchodilators).</p>
<p class="indent">Normal plasma values of epinephrine are 100 pg/mL (590 pmol/L); normal values of norepinephrine are generally less than 100 to 550 pg/mL (590 to 3240 pmol/L). Values of epinephrine greater than 400 pg/mL (2180 pmol/L) or norepinephrine values greater than 2000 pg/mL (11,800 pmol/L) are considered diagnostic of pheochromocytoma. Values that fall between normal levels and those diagnostic of pheochromocytoma indicate the need for further testing.</p>
<p class="indent">A clonidine suppression test may be performed if the results of plasma and urine tests of catecholamines are inconclusive. Clonidine is a centrally acting antiadrenergic medication that suppresses the release of neurogenically mediated catecholamines. The suppression test is based on the principle that catecholamine levels are normally increased through the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In pheochromocytoma, increased catecholamine levels result from the diffusion of excess catecholamines into the circulation, bypassing normal storage and release mechanisms. Therefore, in patients with pheochromocytoma, clonidine does not suppress the release of catecholamines (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Imaging studies, such as CT, MRI, and ultrasonography, may also be carried out to localize the pheochromocytoma and to determine whether more than one tumor is present. The use of <sup>131</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy may be required to determine the location of the pheochromocytoma and to detect metastatic sites outside the adrenal gland. MIBG is a specific isotope for catecholamine-producing tissue. It has been helpful in identifying tumors not detected by other tests or procedures. MIBG scintigraphy is a noninvasive, safe procedure that has increased the accuracy of diagnosis of adrenal tumors (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other diagnostic studies may focus on evaluating the function of other endocrine glands because of the association of pheochromocytoma in some patients with other endocrine tumors.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1998">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During an episode or attack of hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, and the other symptoms of pheochromocytoma, bed rest with the head of the bed elevated is prescribed to promote an orthostatic decrease in blood pressure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient may be treated preoperatively on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Regardless of the setting, monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac function is essential. The goals are to control hypertension before and during surgery and volume expansion, and to prevent a catecholamine storm as a result of surgery (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperatively, the patient may begin treatment with a low dose of an alpha-adrenergic blocker, either phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin, 10 to 14 days or longer prior to surgery (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>). The patient should be informed about the potential for adverse effects of these medications, which include orthostasis, nasal stuffiness, increased fatigue, and retrograde ejaculation in men. The medication dosages are started at a low dose and increased every 2 to 3 days as needed to control blood pressure. Patients may be required to consume a high-sodium diet or take salt supplements.</p>
<p class="indent">After administration of the alpha-blockers, the blood pressure should be monitored closely. In an outpatient setting, the blood pressure should be taken twice daily in a sitting and standing position. The targets are less than 130/80&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg (seated) with a standing systolic pressure greater than 90&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg and target heart rate of 60 to 70 beats per minute sitting and 70 to 80 beats per minute standing (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>). Age and comorbid disease should be taken into consideration when establishing and evaluating targets. Propranolol and metoprolol may be administered with caution to achieve the target heart rate (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Singh &#x0026; Herrick, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine are sometimes used as an alternative or supplement to preoperative alpha- and beta-blockers, when blood pressure control is inadequate or the patient is unable to tolerate the side effects. Nifedipine and nicardipine may be used safely without causing undue hypotension. For episodes of severe hypertension, nifedipine is a fast and effective treatment, because the capsules can be pierced and chewed. The patient needs to be well hydrated before, during, and after surgery to prevent hypotension. Additional medications that may be used preoperatively include catecholamine synthesis inhibitors, such as alpha-methyl-<em>p</em>-tyrosine (metyrosine). These are occasionally used if adrenergic blocking agents (i.e., alpha- and beta-blockers) are not effective. Long-term use of metyrosine may result in many adverse effects, including sedation, depression, diarrhea, anxiety, nightmares, dysuria, impotence, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, anemia, thrombocytopenia, crystalluria, galactorrhea (breast discharge), and extrapyramidal signs (e.g., drooling, speech impairment, tremors).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The definitive treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor, usually with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adrenalectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands">adrenalectomy</button></strong> (removal of one or both adrenal glands); surgical treatment is considered high risk in this patient population. Surgery may be performed using a laparoscopic approach or an open operation. The laparoscopic approach is the preferred method for patients with pheochromocytomas including large tumors because of the decreased blood loss, decreased hospitalization time, and decreased morbidity. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be necessary if tumors are present in both adrenal glands. Patient preparation includes control of blood pressure and blood volumes; usually, this is carried out over 10 to 14 days, as described previously. A calcium channel blocker (nicardipine) can be given intraoperatively exclusively or in combination with the alpha- and beta-blockers to control blood pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">A hypertensive crisis, however, can still arise as a result of manipulation of the tumor during surgical excision, causing a release of stored epinephrine and norepinephrine, with marked increases in blood pressure and changes in heart rate. Exploration of other possible tumor sites is frequently undertaken to ensure removal of all tumor tissue. As a result, the patient is subject to the stress and effects of a long surgical procedure, which may increase the risk of hypertension postoperatively.</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroid replacement is required if bilateral adrenalectomy has been necessary. Corticosteroids may also be required for the first few days or weeks after removal of a single adrenal gland. IV administration of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) may begin on the evening before surgery and continue during the early postoperative period to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Oral preparations of corticosteroids (prednisone) are prescribed after the acute stress of surgery diminishes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypotension and hypoglycemia may occur in the postoperative period because of the sudden withdrawal of excessive amounts of catecholamines. Therefore, careful attention is directed toward monitoring and treating these changes. Hypertension may continue if not all pheochromocytoma tissue was removed, if pheochromocytoma recurs, or if the blood vessels were damaged by severe and prolonged hypertension. Several days after surgery, urine and plasma levels of catecholamines and their metabolites are measured to determine whether the surgery was successful.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1999">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient who has undergone surgery to treat pheochromocytoma has experienced a stressful preoperative and postoperative course and may remain fearful of repeated attacks. Although it is usually expected that all pheochromocytoma tissue has been removed, there is a possibility that other sites were undetected and that attacks may recur. The patient is monitored until stable with special attention given to ECG changes, arterial pressures, fluid and electrolyte balance, and blood glucose levels. IV access will be required for administration of fluids and medications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">During the pre- and postoperative phases of care, the nurse educates the patient about the importance of follow-up monitoring to ensure that pheochromocytoma does not recur undetected. After adrenalectomy, the use of corticosteroids may be needed. Therefore, the nurse educates the patient about their purpose, the medication schedule, and the risks of skipping doses or stopping their administration abruptly.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1476</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1477" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1477">p. 1477</span></div>
<p class="indent">The patient and family are educated about how to measure the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure and when to notify the primary provider about changes in blood pressure. In addition, the nurse provides verbal and written instructions about the procedure for collecting 24-hour urine specimens to monitor urine catecholamine levels.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A follow-up visit from a home, community-based or transitional care nurse may be indicated to assess the patient&#x2019;s postoperative recovery, surgical incision, knowledge regarding medication, and adherence to the medication schedule. This may help reinforce previous education about management and monitoring. The nurse also obtains blood pressure measurements and assists the patient in preventing or dealing with problems that may result from long-term use of corticosteroids.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the risk of recurrence of hypertension, periodic checkups are required, especially in young patients and in those whose families have a history of pheochromocytoma. The patient is scheduled for periodic follow-up appointments to observe for return of normal blood pressure and plasma and urine levels of catecholamines.</p>
