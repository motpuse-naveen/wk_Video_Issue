<p class="nonindent">Because digestion normally begins in the mouth, adequate nutrition is related to good dental health and the general condition of the mouth. Any discomfort, abnormalities, or disease processes in the oral cavity can affect a person&#x2019;s nutritional status. Changes in the oral cavity can influence the type and amount of food ingested as well as the degree to which food particles are properly mixed with salivary enzymes. Disorders of the mouth or tongue can interfere with speech and thus affect communication and self-image. Esophageal problems related to swallowing can also adversely affect food and fluid intake, thereby jeopardizing general health and well-being. Given the close relationship between adequate nutritional intake and the structures of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (lips, mouth, teeth, pharynx, esophagus), health education can help prevent disorders associated with these structures (see <a href="#ff39-1">Fig. 39-1</a>).</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec4">DISORDERS OF THE ORAL CAVITY</p>
<p class="nonindent">Oral health is a very important component of a person&#x2019;s physical and psychological sense of well-being. Periodontal disease, which encompasses both <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gingivitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the gums; change in color from pink to red, with associated swelling, bleeding, and sensitivity/tenderness">gingivitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the gums) and periodontitis (which involves the soft tissue and bone supporting the teeth), is the most common cause of tooth loss among adults (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2926">Office of the Surgeon General, 2003</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2949">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2000</a>). From 2011 to 2012, 44.7% of adults age 30 and older in the United States had periodontitis. When this prevalence is combined with the 2009 to 2010 data, there is a 45.9% prevalence of periodontitis, which means approximately 141 million adults ages 30 and older have diagnosed periodontitis. Severe periodontitis was diagnosed in 8.9% of adults ages 30 and older, but is most prevalent among adults ages 50 and older, males, Hispanic/Latino Americans (63.5%) and non-Hispanic/Latino African Americans (59.1%), those who didn&#x2019;t graduate high school, people living below 200% of the poverty level, and current smokers (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2889">Eke, Dye, Wei, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Current cigarette smoking, which increases the likelihood of periodontitis by at least 50%, remains a key modifiable risk factor for periodontitis at all severity levels (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2890">Eke, Wei, Thornton-Evans, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Periodontal disease can be connected to a variety of other systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid disease (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2870">American Academy of Periodontology [AAP], 2021</a>). <a href="c39-sec01.xhtml#tt39-1">Table 39-1</a> reviews common abnormalities of the oral cavity, their possible causes, and nursing considerations. <a href="#ff39-2">Figure 39-2</a> illustrates structures of the oral cavity.</p>
