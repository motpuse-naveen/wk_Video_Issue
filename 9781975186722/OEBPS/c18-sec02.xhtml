<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rhinitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose">Rhinitis</button></strong> is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation and irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose. These conditions can have a significant impact on quality of life and contribute to sinus, ear, and sleep problems and learning disorders. Rhinitis often coexists with other respiratory disorders, such as asthma. It affects between 10% and 30% of the population worldwide annually. Viral rhinitis, especially the common cold, affects approximately one billion individuals yearly (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Meneghetti, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Rhinitis may be acute or chronic, and allergic or nonallergic. Allergic rhinitis is further classified as seasonal or perennial rhinitis and is commonly associated with exposure to airborne particles such as dust, dander, or plant pollens in people who are allergic to these substances. Seasonal rhinitis occurs during pollen seasons, and perennial rhinitis occurs throughout the year. See <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> for detailed descriptions of allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s542">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Rhinitis may be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in temperature or humidity; odors; infection; age; systemic disease; use of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescribed nasal decongestants; and the presence of a foreign body. Allergic rhinitis may occur with exposure to allergens such as foods (e.g., peanuts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, wheat, shellfish, soy, cow&#x2019;s milk, eggs), medications (e.g., penicillin, sulfa medications, aspirin), and particles in the indoor and outdoor environment (<a href="#ct18-2">Chart&#x00A0;18-2</a>). The most common cause of nonallergic rhinitis is the common cold (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Peters, 2015</a>).</p>

<div class="box7"><p class="Box7pTitle"><strong>Upper Respiratory Tract Disorders in Older Adults</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Upper respiratory infections in older adults may have more serious consequences if patients have concurrent medical problems that compromise their respiratory or immune status.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Influenza causes exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced pulmonary function.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Antihistamines and decongestants used to treat upper respiratory disorders must be used cautiously in older adults because of their side effects and potential interactions with other medications.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The prevalence of nonallergic rhinosinusitis is greater among older adults than among adults of other age groups. Rhinosinusitis is the sixth most common chronic disease among older adults. With anticipated future growth in the older adult population, the need for endoscopic sinus surgery will increase. Older patients with nonallergic rhinosinusitis present with symptoms similar to those of younger adults and experience a similar degree of improvement and quality of life after endoscopic sinus surgery.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The structure of the nose changes with aging; it lengthens and the tip droops from loss of cartilage. This can cause restriction in airflow and predispose older adult patients to geriatric rhinitis, characterized by increased thin, watery sinus drainage. These structural changes may also adversely affect the sense of smell.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Laryngitis in older adults is common and may be secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Older adults are more likely to have impaired esophageal peristalsis and a weaker esophageal sphincter. Treatment measures include sleeping with the head of the bed elevated and the use of medications such as histamine-2 receptor blockers (e.g., famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Age-related loss of muscle mass and thinning of the mucous membranes can cause structural changes in the larynx that may change characteristics of the voice. In general, the pitch of voice becomes higher in older adult men and lower in older adult women. The voice also &#x201C;thins&#x201D; (decreased projection) and may sound tremulous. These changes should be discriminated from signs that could indicate pathologic conditions.</p>

Although pathophysiologic processes are similar in rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, they affect different structures. <strong>A.</strong> In rhinitis, the mucous membranes lining the nasal passages become inflamed, congested, and edematous. The swollen nasal conchae block the sinus openings, and mucus is discharged from the nostrils. <strong>B.</strong> Rhinosinusitis is also marked by inflammation and congestion, with thickened mucous secretions filling the sinus cavities and occluding the openings.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s544">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of rhinitis depends on the cause, which may be identified through the history and physical examination. The nurse asks the patient about recent symptoms as well as possible exposure to allergens in the home, environment, or workplace. If viral rhinitis is the cause, medications may be prescribed to relieve the symptoms. In allergic rhinitis, allergy tests may be performed to identify possible allergens. Depending on the severity of the allergy, desensitizing immunizations and corticosteroids may be required (see <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a> for more details). If symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, an antimicrobial agent is used. Patients with nasal septal deformities <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page497" title="497"></span>or nasal polyps may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medication therapy for allergic and nonallergic rhinitis focuses on symptom relief. Antihistamines and nasal sprays may be useful. Antihistamines remain the most common treatment and are given for sneezing, pruritus, and rhinorrhea. (Examples of commonly prescribed antihistamines are discussed in more detail in <a href="c33.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>.) Brompheniramine/pseudoephedrine is an example of combination antihistamine/decongestant medications. Cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits the release of histamine and other chemicals, is also used in the treatment of rhinitis. Oral decongestant agents may be used for nasal obstruction. The use of saline nasal spray can act as a mild decongestant and can liquefy mucus to prevent crusting. Two inhalations of intranasal ipratropium can be given in each nostril two to three times per day for symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea. In addition, intranasal corticosteroids may be used for severe congestion, and ophthalmic agents (cromolyn ophthalmic solution 4%) may be used to relieve irritation, itching, and redness of the eyes. Appropriate allergy treatments may include leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast, zafirlukast, zileuton), and immunoglobulin E modifiers (e.g., omalizumab), which are also components of asthma treatment guidelines (discussed further in <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>). The choice of medications depends on the symptoms, adverse reactions, adherence factors, risk of drug interactions, and cost to the patient (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Hauk, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s545">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse instructs the patient with allergic rhinitis to avoid or reduce exposure to allergens and irritants, such as dusts, molds, animals, fumes, odors, powders, sprays, and tobacco smoke. Patient education is essential when assisting the patient in the use of all medications. To prevent possible drug interactions, the patient is cautioned to read drug labels before taking any OTC medication.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse instructs the patient about the importance of controlling the environment at home and at work. Saline nasal sprays or aerosols may be helpful in soothing mucous membranes, softening crusted secretions, and removing irritants. The nurse instructs the patient in correct administration of nasal medications. To achieve maximal relief, the patient is instructed to blow the nose before applying any medication into the nasal cavity. In addition, the patient is taught to keep the head upright; spray quickly and firmly into each nostril away from the nasal septum; and wait at least 1 minute before administering the second spray. The container should be cleaned after each use and should never be shared with other people to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of infectious rhinitis, the nurse reviews hand hygiene technique with the patient as a measure to prevent transmission of organisms. This is especially important for those in contact with vulnerable populations such as the very young, older adults, or people who are immunosuppressed (e.g., patients with human immune deficiency virus [HIV] infection, those taking immunosuppressive medications). In older adults and other high-risk populations, the nurse reviews the importance of receiving an influenza vaccination each year to achieve immunity before the beginning of the flu season.</p>
