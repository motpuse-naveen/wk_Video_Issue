<p class="nonindent">Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignant primary orbital tumor in childhood; it can also develop in older adults (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4201">Tang, Zhang, Lu, et al., 2018</a>). The symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma include sudden painless proptosis of one eye followed by lid swelling, conjunctival chemosis, and impairment of ocular motility. CT or MRI scans of these tumors establish the size, configuration, location, and stage of the disease; delineates the degree of bone destruction; and is useful in estimating the field for radiation therapy. The most common site of metastasis is the lung.</p>
<p class="indent">Management of these primary malignant orbital tumors involves three major therapeutic modalities: surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The degree of orbital destruction is important in planning the surgical approach. Resection often involves removal of the eyeball. The psychological needs of the patient and family are paramount in planning the management approach.</p>
