<h4 class="h4" id="s2681">Malignant Skin Tumors</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Each year, more people are diagnosed with skin cancer than all other cancers combined. It is estimated that at least one in five Americans will have skin cancer by age 70. The cost of treating Americans with skin cancers is estimated at $8.1 billion annually (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2020a). Because the skin is easily inspected, skin cancer is readily seen and detected and is therefore believed to be amenable to early intervention.</p>
<p class="indent">Exposure to UV radiation, including the sun and artificial UV rays (e.g., tanning booths) is the leading preventable cause of skin cancer; incidence is related to the total amount of exposure to UV radiation. Damage is cumulative, and harmful effects may be severe by 18 years of age (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2020a). Skin cancers in adults tend to manifest after a 20- to 50-year latency period post-UV radiation exposure (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>) (<a href="#ct56-5">Chart 56-5</a>). Over 99% of all skin cancers include melanoma and the two most common types of nonmelanoma skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2020a).</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m8">Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">Basal cell carcinoma is the most prevalent skin cancer in the United States, responsible for 80% of all skin cancers in both men and women. It is rarely associated with any morbidity and rarely causes death. It is twice as common in men than women (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>). Although less common than basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma is the second most prevalent skin cancer in the United States. It is two to three times more common in men than women (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Najjar, 2020</a>). Although less aggressive than melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma is believed to be responsible for at least 15,000 deaths annually (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2020a).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2682">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Basal cell carcinoma generally appears on sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, neck, hands, and scalp. Basal cell carcinoma usually begins as a small, waxy nodule with rolled, translucent, pearly borders; telangiectatic vessels may be present. As it grows, it undergoes central ulceration and sometimes crusting (<a href="#ff56-8">Fig. 56-8</a>A). The tumors appear most frequently on the face. Basal cell carcinoma is characterized by invasion and erosion of contiguous (adjoining) tissues. It rarely metastasizes, but recurrence is common. However, a neglected lesion can result in the loss of a nose, an ear, or a lip. Other variants of basal cell carcinoma may appear as shiny, flat, gray, or yellowish plaques (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant proliferation arising from the epidermis. Its precursor is typically actinic keratosis (see previous discussion). Although it usually appears on sun-damaged skin, it may arise from normal skin or from preexisting skin lesions. It is of greater concern than basal cell carcinoma because it is an invasive carcinoma, metastasizing in 4% to 8% of cases by the blood or lymphatic system (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Najjar, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Squamous cell carcinoma appears as a rough, thickened, scaly tumor that may be asymptomatic or may bleed (<a href="#ff56-8">Fig. 56-8</a>B). The border of a squamous cell carcinoma lesion may be wider, more infiltrated, and more inflammatory than that of a basal cell carcinoma lesion. Secondary infection can occur. Exposed areas, especially of the upper extremities and of the face, lower lip, ears, nose, and forehead, are common sites (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Najjar, 2020</a>). The prognosis for squamous cell carcinoma depends on the incidence of metastases, which is related to the histologic type and the level or depth of invasion. Regional lymph nodes should be evaluated for metastases (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Najjar, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2683">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment is to eradicate the tumor. The treatment method depends on the tumor location; the cell type, location, and depth; the cosmetic desires of the patient; the history of previous treatment; whether the tumor is invasive; and whether metastatic nodes are present. Management of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma includes surgical excision, which may include Mohs micrographic surgery, electrosurgery, or cryosurgery. In patients who are not surgical candidates, alternatives such as radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy, or topical chemotherapeutic creams may be viable options (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The main goal is to remove the tumor entirely. The best way to maintain cosmetic appearance is to place the incision properly along natural skin tension lines and natural anatomic body lines. In this way, scars are less noticeable. The size of the incision depends on the tumor size and location but usually involves a length-to-width ratio of 3:1.</p>
<p class="indent">The adequacy of the surgical excision is verified by microscopic evaluation of sections of the specimen. When the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1854" title="1854"></span>tumor is large, reconstructive surgery with the use of a skin flap or skin grafting may be required. The incision is closed in layers to enhance cosmetic effect. A pressure dressing applied over the wound provides support. Infection after a simple excision is uncommon if proper surgical asepsis is maintained.</p>

Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams &#x0026; Wilkins.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Mohs Micrographic Surgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">This technique is the most accurate surgical technique and best conserves normal tissue. The procedure removes the tumor layer by layer. The first layer excised includes all evident tumor and a small margin of normal-appearing tissue. The specimen is frozen and analyzed by section to determine if all of the tumor has been removed. If not, additional layers of tissue are shaved and examined until all tissue margins are tumor free. In this manner, only the tumor and a safe, normal tissue margin are removed. Mohs surgery is the recommended tissue-sparing procedure, with extremely high cure rates for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. It is the treatment of choice and the most effective for tumors around the eyes, nose, upper lip, and auricular and periauricular areas (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Najjar, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Electrosurgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">Electrosurgery is the destruction or removal of tissue by electrical energy. The current is converted to heat, which then passes to the tissue from a cold electrode. Electrosurgery may be preceded by curettage (excising the skin tumor by scraping its surface with a curette). Electrodesiccation is then implemented to achieve hemostasis and to destroy any viable malignant cells at the base of the wound or along its edges. Electrodesiccation and curettage is useful for lesions smaller than 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 inch) in diameter.</p>
<p class="indent">This method takes advantage of the fact that the tumor is softer than the surrounding skin and therefore can be outlined by a curette, which &#x201C;feels&#x201D; the extent of the tumor. The tumor is removed and the base cauterized. The process is repeated twice. Usually, healing occurs within 1 month (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Cryosurgery</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cryosurgery destroys the tumor by deep-freezing the tissue. A thermocouple needle apparatus is inserted into the skin, and liquid nitrogen is directed to the center of the tumor until the tumor base is &#x2212;40&#x00B0; to &#x2212;60&#x00B0;C (&#x2212;40&#x00B0; to &#x2212;76&#x00B0;F). Liquid nitrogen has the lowest boiling point of all cryogens, is inexpensive, and is easy to obtain. The tumor tissue is frozen, allowed to thaw, and then refrozen. The site thaws naturally and then becomes gelatinous and heals spontaneously. Swelling and edema follow the freezing. The appearance of the lesion varies. Normal healing, which may take 4 to 6 weeks, occurs faster in areas with a good blood supply (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nonsurgical Alternative Therapies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Some older adult patients may defer surgical treatment options. Furthermore, in some cases, lesions may be extensive or are located on sites where wide surgical excision is not practical to achieve (e.g., cancer of the eyelid, tip of the nose). In these cases, local radiation therapy (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) or photodynamic therapy may prove reasonable alternatives. Photodynamic therapy involves application of 5-aminolevulinic acid to the lesion, which is then followed by photoactivation with directed blue light for approximately 1 hour. This has the effect of locally destroying the neoplastic cells, with good cosmetic results. Topical application of 5-fluorouracil cream (a chemotherapeutic agent) may be tried as another alternative to managing superficial basal cell carcinoma (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bader, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient should be informed that the skin may become red and blistered after any of these therapies. A bland skin ointment prescribed by the primary provider may be applied to relieve discomfort. The patient should also be cautioned to avoid exposure to the sun.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2684">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because many skin cancers are removed by excision, patients are usually treated in outpatient surgical units. The role of the nurse is to educate the patient about prevention of skin cancer (<a href="#ct56-6">Chart 56-6</a>) and self-care after treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The wound is usually covered with a dressing to protect the site from physical trauma, external irritants, and contaminants. The patient is advised when to report for a dressing change or is given written and verbal information on how to change dressings, including the type of dressing to purchase, how to remove dressings and apply fresh ones, and the importance of hand hygiene before and after the procedure.</p>

<p class="indent">The patient is advised to watch for excessive bleeding and tight dressings that compromise circulation. If the lesion is in the perioral area, the patient is instructed to drink liquids through a straw and limit talking and facial movement. Dental work should be avoided until the area is completely healed.</p>
<p class="indent">After the sutures are removed, an emollient cream may be used to help reduce dryness. Applying a sunscreen over the wound is advised to prevent postoperative hyperpigmentation if the patient spends time outdoors.</p>
<p class="indent">Follow-up examinations should be at regular intervals, usually every 3 months for a year, and should include palpation of the adjacent lymph nodes. The patient should also be instructed to seek treatment for any moles that are subject to repeated friction and irritation and to watch for indications of potential malignancy in moles as described previously. The importance of lifelong follow-up evaluations is emphasized.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m9">Melanoma</p>
<p class="nonindent">A melanoma is a cancerous neoplasm characterized by neoplastic melanocytes present in the epidermis and the dermis (and sometimes the subcutaneous cells). Although melanoma only accounts for 1% of all skin cancers, it is responsible for approximately 6,850 deaths annually (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Siegel, Miller, &#x0026; Jemal, 2020</a>). White Americans are 20 times more at risk for melanoma than Black Americans. It may strike adults of any age; however, the average age at diagnosis is 65 years. It is more prevalent among women than men younger than 50 years of age; by 65 years of age, it is twice as common among men than women and, by 80 years of age, is three times as common among men than women (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>). Risk factors for melanoma are noted in <a href="#ct56-5">Chart 56-5</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2685">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Melanoma may manifest as a change in a nevus or a new growth on the skin, arising from cutaneous epidermal melanocytes. A malignant melanoma is typically dark, red or blue colored, or a mix of any of these, and irregular in shape. It may be associated with itching, rapid growth, ulceration, or bleeding. This type of malignancy is found more frequently in the lower extremities in women, and in the trunk, neck, or head in men (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4069">National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2020</a>). Rarely, melanomas may develop in the uveal tract of the eye or the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Melanoma can occur in one of the several forms: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, nodular, acral lentiginous, mucosal lentiginous, desmoplastic, and verrucous melanoma (the last three are rarely seen) (<a href="#ff56-9">Fig. 56-9</a>). Each of these types have specific histologic features; however, the histologic features do not dictate treatment options and are not associated with differential prognoses (NCI, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Melanomas spread in two growth phases: radial and vertical. During the first growth phase&#x2014;the radial phase&#x2014;the tumor tends to spread radially within the epidermis. It is during this earlier phase of radial growth that the tumor is most amenable to treatment. The second growth phase&#x2014;the vertical phase&#x2014;is characterized by vertical tumor growth into the dermal layer and eventual metastasis. Melanomas that progress more rapidly from the radial to the vertical growth phase are considered more aggressive types and have a poorer prognosis (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2686">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Biopsy results confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. An excisional biopsy specimen provides information on the type, level of invasion, and thickness of the lesion. A specimen that includes a 1- to 2-cm margin of normal tissue and a portion of underlying subcutaneous fatty tissue is sufficient for staging a melanoma in situ or an early, noninvasive melanoma. Incisional biopsy should be performed when the suspicious lesion is too large to be removed safely without extensive scarring. Biopsy specimens obtained by shaving, curettage, or needle aspiration are not considered reliable histologic proof of disease (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A thorough history and physical examination should include a meticulous skin examination and palpation of regional lymph nodes that may drain the area surrounding the tumor. Because melanoma occurs in families, a positive family history of melanoma is investigated so that first-degree relatives, who may be at high risk for melanoma, can be evaluated for atypical lesions. After the diagnosis of melanoma has been confirmed, a chest x-ray, CBC, complete chemistry panel with creatinine, liver function tests, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are usually performed. The LDH may be elevated in the presence of metastatic disease. Depending on the results of these tests, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, and positron emission tomography scans of the lymphatics may be indicated to further stage the extent of disease (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Staging of the tumor follows the TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) classification system (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) and is used to determine appropriate treatment (NCI, 2020):</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Stage 0: tumor in situ with only epidermal lesion</li>
<li>Stage 1: tumor 2 mm thick or less without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis</li>
<li>State 2: tumor more than 2 mm thick without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis</li>
<li>Stage 3: tumor of any thickness with involvement of at least one lymph node but no distant metastasis</li>
<li>Stage 4: tumor of any thickness, with or without lymph node involvement, and with distant metastasis</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Patients with either stage 0 or stage 1 disease have a better than 99% likelihood of survival 5 years post diagnosis (ACS, 2019c). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1856" title="1856"></span>Early detection and treatment are thus key to ensuring good outcomes over the long term.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2687">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment depends on the stage of the tumor and the tumor type. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for small, superficial lesions. Deeper lesions require wide local excision, after which skin grafting may be necessary. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is commonly performed to examine the nodes nearest the tumor and to spare the patient the long-term sequelae of extensive removal of lymph nodes if the sampled nodes are negative. If these are positive, lymph node dissection may be indicated (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with tumor cells present in multiple lymph nodes may benefit from radiation therapy to that chain of lymph nodes post dissection. It is thought that radiation therapy not only thwarts the recurrence of tumor cells within the lymphatics, but also improves the overall efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, a clear benefit for patients for whom that treatment is indicated (i.e., patients who are <em>BRAF</em> negative) (see following discussion) (NCI, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with stage 2 tumors considered at risk for relapse were traditionally prescribed interferon alfa-2 therapy; however, long-term data did not support its therapeutic benefit. These patients tend to be managed with surgical excision only and then close ongoing monitoring for recurrence or metastasis (ACS, 2019c; NCI, 2020; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with stage 3 and stage 4 tumors may be managed with intravenous checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or ipilimumab. Checkpoint inhibitors enhance the action of T cells by inhibiting a specific &#x201C;off&#x201D; switch on their cellular surfaces, making them more effective in targeting and attacking cancer cells (ACS, 2019c; NCI, 2020; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>). At least half of all patients with melanoma have a <em>BRAF</em> genetic mutation (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">NIC, 2020</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>). These patients may be prescribed a <em>BRAF</em> inhibitor, to turn off the function of the <em>BRAF</em> mutation responsible for tumor growth. This therapy is typically prescribed along with an <em>MEK</em> inhibitor, as the <em>MEK</em> gene works in tandem with the <em>BRAF</em> mutation. This type of therapeutic regimen, called <em>targeted therapy</em>, may be prescribed in lieu of checkpoint inhibitors. Both <em>BRAF</em> inhibitors (dabrafenib, encorafenib, and vemurafenib) and <em>MEK</em> inhibitors (trametinib, cobemetinib, and binimetinib) may be administered orally. <em>BRAF</em> inhibitors are associated with an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, however (NCI, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are diagnosed with melanoma are at high risk for a second melanoma or a recurrence of their primary tumor. Intralesional injection of an immunotherapeutic vaccine, talimogene laherparepvec, may be indicated in patients with recurrence of tumor that is considered nonresectable. Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically modified oncolytic agent that is derived from herpes simplex-1 virus. Its use is associated with decreased tumor mass, although there is not an overall improvement in long-term survival (NCI, 2020).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2688">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The best hope for decreasing the incidence of advanced melanoma lies in educating patients to recognize its early signs, when it is amenable to treatment and cure. The nurse educates patients at risk to examine their skin and scalp monthly in a systematic manner and to seek prompt medical attention if changes are detected. This is especially true for patients with a prior history of melanoma, as the likelihood of a second melanoma is higher than in patients without a personal history of having had melanoma (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Tan, 2020</a>). The AAD provides multimedia resources on performing skin self-examination (see the Resources section at the end of this chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">An important risk factor in the development of melanoma is exposure to UV radiation (e.g., sunlight). Irrespective of the presence or absence of other risks, all patients should be educated about the risks of UV radiation exposure and methods to mitigate that risk (e.g., sunscreen, shade). A group particularly at risk is young adult athletes, especially women (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4064">McGuffin, Jordan, Langford, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4072">Orsimarsi, 2019</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct56-7">Chart 56-7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence of nevi, particularly multiple nevi, is another risk factor for melanoma that should be addressed. The nurse educates patients with nevi how to self-assess for signs that may suggest malignant transformation, referred to as the <em>ABCDEs of Moles</em> (<a href="#ct56-8">Chart 56-8</a>). Evidence of these types of changes should be promptly reported to the patient&#x2019;s primary provider for further evaluation. Patients should also be on the alert for formation of the proverbial <em>Ugly Duckling</em> nevus, which may appear different from other nevi. In addition, reportable symptoms that may be consistent with a melanotic malignancy include pruritus, tenderness, and pain at the site of a nevus (Skin Care Foundation, 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with a new diagnosis of advanced melanoma must be prepared for wide surgical excision. A melanoma may present on any skin surface, although they tend to appear on surfaces exposed to sun (e.g., extremities, head). Surgical removal of melanoma in different locations presents different challenges, taking into consideration the removal of the primary melanoma, and whether or not multiple sentinel lymph nodes evidence cancerous spread, necessitating lymph node dissection. A split- or full-thickness skin graft may be necessary when large defects are created by surgical removal of a melanoma (see <a href="c57.xhtml">Chapter 57</a> for further discussion of skin grafts). Nursing interventions after surgery for melanoma center on promoting comfort, including anticipating the need for and administration of appropriate analgesic medications (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Psychological support is essential when surgery that might be disfiguring is performed (<a href="#ct56-9">Chart 56-9</a>). Support includes encouraging the patient to express anxieties and feelings about the seriousness of the neoplasm and conveying understanding of these feelings. During the diagnostic workup and staging of the depth, type, and extent of the tumor, the nurse answers questions, provides information, and helps clarify misconceptions. Learning that they have a melanoma can cause the patient considerable fear and anguish. Pointing out the patient&#x2019;s resources, past effective coping mechanisms, and social support systems helps the patient cope with the diagnosis and need for treatment and continuing follow-up. Family members should be included in all discussions to enable them to clarify information, ask questions that the patient might be reluctant to ask, and provide emotional support to the patient.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">McGuffin, K. S., Jordan, K., Langford, D., et al. (2019). Assessing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding sun safety in female collegiate athletes. <em>Journal of the Dermatology Nurses&#x2019; Association</em>, <em>11</em>(1), 20&#x2013;33.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Melanoma is a common type of cancer among young adults, and its incidence has been rising for the past 30 years. Young adult athletes who compete in outdoor sports are at high risk for melanoma because they spend long hours exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (i.e., sunlight) during games, matches, and practices. Young women are at greater risk for melanoma than young men, and frequently develop melanotic lesions in their extremities. Thus, women college athletes who compete in outdoor sports are especially at risk for melanoma, since their extremities are subjected to long&#x2013;UV-radiation exposure. The purpose of this research study was to find if an education intervention would improve knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on sun protection practices among female college athletes.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The setting for this study was a public university in North Carolina. All varsity women athletes who competed in track, soccer, softball, tennis, and cross country were eligible and invited to participate, and all consented (<em>N</em> = 81). The researchers designed a brief 15-minute education intervention with PowerPoint&#x2122; images on sun safety practices, and delivered the intervention in a classroom setting in the university athletic offices. Participants took a pretest immediately prior to the intervention, which was a modified version of the Melanoma Risk Behavior Survey. The same survey was taken as the posttest immediately after the intervention was completed, and again 3 months after the intervention was completed. A paired <em>t</em>-test was done between the pretest and the posttests to determine whether or not there were improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on sun safety practices among participants.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants&#x2019; knowledge of sun safety significantly improved from pretest to the first posttest (<em>t</em> = 15.232, <em>p</em> &#x2264; 0.001). This improvement was sustained from pretest to the second posttest 3 months post intervention (<em>t</em> = 14.366, <em>p</em> &#x2264; 0.001). Moreover, 3 months postintervention, 79.1% of participants self-reported that they applied sunscreen more often than they had preintervention and experienced fewer sunburns post intervention; 91.6% affirmed that they would continue to engage in sun safety in the future.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">On an anecdotal level, the researchers noted that many participants were surprised to learn of their melanoma risks. In particular, women athletes with dark skin did not see the need to use sunscreen and practice sun safety. While individuals with darker skin are at lesser risk of skin cancer than those with lighter skin, anyone afflicted with a sunburn has a higher risk of melanoma. This education intervention was concise and yet focused and ultimately, effective in its aim. It can be readily replicated in other college and high school settings. Future interventions could be delivered not only to the athletes, but also to their trainers and coaches, who could continue to encourage sun safety among young adult athletes.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with advanced melanoma will be prescribed either targeted therapy or a checkpoint inhibitor, depending upon the patient&#x2019;s <em>BRAF</em> status (see previous discussion). Because the agents that comprise targeted therapy for the patient who is <em>BRAF</em> positive may be administered orally, the patient can self-administer them at home, a key advantage. These agents have few side effects, most of which tend to be cutaneous (e.g., rashes, photosensitivity). In addition, patients taking these agents are at greater risk for developing squamous cell carcinomas (ACS, 2019d). Patients on these regimens should be educated to self-assess their skin and promptly report any signs to their primary provider for definitive follow-up. The importance of engaging in sun safety protocols including seeking shade whenever feasible when outdoors, and applying sunscreen, cannot be overemphasized.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who is <em>BRAF</em> negative likely will be prescribed a checkpoint inhibitor. These agents must be administered IV; therefore, the patient must anticipate receiving treatments in an infusion center. Treatments are typically administered every 2 to 3 weeks for up to a year. However, the checkpoint inhibitors may be administered via a peripheral vein, and so the patient need not have an IV port placed. Furthermore, these agents tend to be tolerated better than most chemotherapeutic agents. The most commonly noted side effects include fatigue, rash, and diarrhea or constipation (ACS, 2020b). Patients receiving these agents should be educated to monitor for and promptly report side effects and to engage in sun safety protocols.</p>

<div class="box3">
<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Assessing the ABCDEs of Moles</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Melanomas may be distinguished from benign nevi, using the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>A for Asymmetry</strong></p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The lesion does not appear balanced on both sides. If an imaginary line was drawn down the middle, the two halves would not look alike.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The lesion has an irregular surface with irregular topography (uneven elevations) either palpable or visible. A change in the surface may be noted from smooth to scaly.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>B for Irregular Border</strong></p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Angular indentations or multiple notches appear in the border.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The border is fuzzy or indistinct, as if rubbed with an eraser.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>C for Variegated Color</strong></p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Benign moles are usually a uniform light to medium brown. Darker coloration indicates that the melanocytes have penetrated to a deeper layer of the dermis.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Colors that may indicate malignancy if found together within a single lesion are shades of red, white, and blue; shades of blue are ominous.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>White areas within a pigmented lesion are suspicious.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Some melanomas, however, are not variegated but are uniformly colored (bluish-black, bluish-gray, bluish-red).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>D for Diameter</strong></p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>A diameter &#x003E;6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) is considered more suspicious, although this finding without other signs is not significant. Many benign skin growths are larger than 6&#x00A0;mm, whereas some early melanomas may be smaller.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>E for Evolving</strong></p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Benign moles appear the same over time; when a mole starts to change in appearance, in size, shape, color, or elevation, it may suggest malignancy.</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Should Crowdfunding for Nonevidence&#x2013;Based Therapies Be Permitted?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You work as a nurse navigator in a surgical oncology clinic. O.G. is a 29-year-old woman who was referred to the clinic by her dermatologist for evaluation of a melanoma on her right upper arm. The surgical oncologist that examined O.G. wishes to perform a wide excision of her tumor with graft placement. You have an appointment set up with O.G. to coordinate her care between the surgical oncologist, a plastic surgeon (for the anticipated skin graft that will be performed after the tumor is excised), and a medical oncologist (for coordination of postoperative treatments). During your visit, O.G. states that she is reluctant to have the surgery since she believes it will be disfiguring. She tells you that her older sister was diagnosed with a melanoma 2 years ago that was successfully treated using black salve prescribed by a homeopathic physician in Mumbai, India. Although O.G. cannot afford to travel to India to pursue these treatments, her sister has offered to manage a GoFundMe&#x2122; site for her so that she might be able to pursue this option, which she finds more palatable than the treatment plan proposed by the surgical oncologist.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Using social media to engage in crowdfunding, or online solicitation for donations, has become very popular over the past several years. Crowdfunding to solicit donations for medical procedures, therapies, or travel and other expenses related to pursuing medical treatment, is particularly commonplace. Bioethicists have criticized the use of medical crowdfunding for several reasons. Arguably, donors to crowdfunding platforms tend to favor people who seem more appealing or relatable, which can result in further widening of disparities in access to health care resources (causing a <em>distributive justice</em> dilemma). For instance, few people seeking donor support for obesity-related medical services are successful in raising funds on these sites, as persons with obesity may seem less appealing to some donors. Likewise, fewer people from ethnic minority groups tend to be successful in fundraising efforts than people who appear to be White and middle-class. Furthermore, not all people for whom funds are ostensibly raised may fully understand or consent to the setup of their fundraising platforms. These individuals may be coerced to do so by others, or lack the ability to fully comprehend what is being done on their behalf, or may be deceived by their fundraisers and not receive the funds raised for their relief.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Many patients with cancer use complementary and alternative medicine to assist them in managing the myriad of symptoms associated with cancer. Most patients use complementary and alternative therapies to complement mainstream medical treatments (i.e., allopathic medicine). However, some patients may elect to singularly pursue complementary and alternative therapy in lieu of evidence-based allopathic medical treatment. Crowdfunding can be used to try to finance these treatments, which are not covered by health insurance policies. Crowdfunding platforms have been criticized for not blocking the setup of these types of solicitations from their sites.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Do you believe that O.G. has the right to determine what treatment options are best for her, even when the treatment option she chooses is not evidence-based? How would you assure your role to do what is in O.G.&#x2019;s best interests without threatening her right to self-determination and without taking on a paternalistic tone (i.e., <em>I know what is best for you</em>)?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>How might family dynamics be affecting O.G.&#x2019;s decision to pursue treatment options? It is not uncommon for patients with melanoma to have first-degree relatives who also have melanoma. How might O.G.&#x2019;s relationship with her older sister, and her sister&#x2019;s previous treatment for melanoma, affect O.G.&#x2019;s decision making now?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might you use to help you advocate for O.G. and assure that resources targeted to treat her melanoma are used in a just manner? How might O.G.&#x2019;s medical crowdfunding platform affect the well-being of other patients with melanoma?</p>

<p class="nonindent">Until a few years ago, patients with metastatic disease had a grim prognosis. With the advent of targeted therapy and checkpoint inhibitors within the past decade, hope for remission and even cure is possible. Patients with metastatic disease and their family members should be given this positive news when they seek treatment. However, there are still instances where remission or cure is not possible. There is some evidence that patients with metastatic disease who are at end-of-life are not linked into palliative care services appropriately when they are near death, as it is becoming difficult to clearly identify when treatments aimed at remission have failed (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4041">Fox, Rosenberg, Ekberg, et al., 2020</a>). The nurse caring for a patient with metastatic melanoma who is nearing end-of-life must advocate for the patient and family so that they receive appropriate and timely palliative care services (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
