<h4 class="h4" id="s3289">Weapons of Terror</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Geopolitical forces and interests and the availability of destructive technology have brought the possibility of more terrorist events to our doorstep. Terrorism involves the systematic use of violence to create feelings of fear. Examples include the destruction of the World Trade Center towers and the damage to the Pentagon on September 11, 2001; the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013; and the coordinated series of terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13, 2015; in Brussels on March 22, 2016; and the London attacks on Westminster Bridge and Parliament on June 3, 2017. Over 26,445 deaths had occurred in 2017 from terrorism-related violence; over the last decade, deaths across the world from terrorism ranged from a low of 7827 in 2010 to a high of 44,490, in 2014 (<a href="#bib4729">Ritchie, Hasell, Appel, et al., 2020</a>). Terrorists have become increasingly sophisticated, organized, and therefore effective. It is no longer a question of <em>whether</em> a terrorist event will again lead to mass casualties, but <em>when</em> such an event will occur. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created after the attacks of September 11, 2001, to coordinate federal and state efforts to combat terrorist activity.</p>

<p class="indent">Terrorists preferentially use WMD which may leverage the use of blasts or biologic, chemical, or radiologic agents. Although terrorist events are not everyday events, they can occur at any facility, and every nurse needs to know the basics of caring for patients who have been affected.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3290">Blast Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A blast may result from terrorism but can also occur anywhere at any time if the right (or wrong) circumstances come together (e.g., welding inside of a tank that formerly contained tar but was not properly cleaned can result in an explosion as well as severe tar burns to the worker).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Types of Explosive Devices</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The bomb most commonly utilized by terrorists is the pipe bomb, which contains low-velocity explosives and may also contain nails or other implements that cause more damage when the explosive ignites. Another type of commonly used explosive device is the Molotov cocktail, which uses a common flammable liquid such as gasoline in a glass bottle and a source of ignition, such as a rag. This forms a simple yet effective incendiary device. Other types of explosive devices include fertilizer bombs and dirty bombs, which include a radioactive source that spreads radiation after the initial blast (<a href="#bib4754">Durakovic, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hazards following a bombing include secondary devices (set to explode at a predetermined time, typically after the arrival of rescue personnel); building collapse; contamination from biologic, chemical, or radiologic weapons; and the presence of terrorists among the patients and bystanders. The entire scene of the bombing is a crime scene and is treated as such. Triage of patients involved in a bombing is the same as for all other disasters, with a heightened awareness that serious internal injuries from the blast wave may not be immediately evident.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Physical Injuries</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Distance from the blast, whether the blast space was enclosed, composition of the explosive, whether a building collapsed, and the efficiency of medical resources available after the blast all affect patient outcomes after a blast injury. The actual blast that occurs during the initial seconds of the bombing or explosion causes a pressure wave or primary blast wave. Injuries can result from the impact of the explosion, the primary blast wave, or shrapnel (i.e., debris from the bomb). The majority of injuries are caused by the primary blast wave (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>). A blast wave has four effects. These include spalling, which refers to the pressure wave itself; implosion, which refers to rupture of organs from entrapped gases; shearing, which refers to the blast response of different body tissues, dependent on their density; and irreversible work, which refers to the presence of forces that exceed the tensile strength of an organ or tissue. If the blast occurs in an enclosed space, the wave has the opportunity to be reflected and thus amplified (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). The various phases of blasts and related injuries are detailed in <a href="#tt68-4">Table 68-4</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Blast Lung</p>
<p class="nonindent">Blast lung results from the blast wave as it passes through air-filled lungs. The result is hemorrhage and tearing of the lung, ventilation&#x2013;perfusion mismatch, and possible air emboli. Typical signs and symptoms include dyspnea, hypoxia, tachypnea or apnea (depending on severity), cough, chest pain, and hemodynamic instability. Management involves providing respiratory support that includes administration of supplemental oxygen with nonrebreathing mask but may also require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. If a hemothorax or pneumothorax is present, a chest tube must be inserted to re-expand the lung. In the event of an air embolus, the patient should be immediately placed in the prone, left lateral position to prevent migration of the embolus and will require emergent treatment in a hyperbaric chamber (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>). Complications following blast lung can include respiratory failure as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Tympanic Membrane Rupture</p>
<p class="nonindent">Tympanic membrane (TM) rupture is the most frequent injury after subjection to a pressure wave because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2232" title="2232"></span>TM is the body&#x2019;s most sensitive organ to pressure. There is an increased incidence of TM rupture when a blast occurs in close proximity to the patient and when it occurs in an enclosed space. Signs and symptoms include hearing loss, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and otorrhea (<a href="#bib4754">Jorolemon, Lopez, &#x0026; Krywko, 2019</a>). The majority of TM ruptures heal spontaneously. Approximately 5% of patients with TM rupture from a blast will require hearing aids, whereas the majority will suffer only mild high-frequency hearing loss (ENA, 2019). Other ear injuries may include ossicular disruption and impaction of foreign bodies.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Abdominal and Head Injuries</p>
<p class="nonindent">Blast abdomen may be evidenced by abdominal hemorrhage and internal organ injury. The typical signs and symptoms of internal abdominal injury can include pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, rectal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting (<a href="#bib4754">Jorolemon et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Head injuries are typically minor, but those that are severe result in the majority of postblast deaths. These injuries can occur without a direct blow to the head and may result from the blast itself, building collapse, or flying debris. Concussions commonly occur post blast, and the usual follow-up evaluation and treatment for postconcussive syndrome is indicated (see <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>). Approximately 30% of head injuries involve vascular structures (e.g., arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, or dissection) (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Special Populations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Special populations may have different blast-associated risks. For instance, older adults are particularly susceptible to bone fractures because they tend to have decreased bone density. They also tend to have more preexisting morbid conditions that may be exacerbated by the explosion. Patients who are pregnant are particularly susceptible to placental shear forces that may result in abruptio placentae. People with mobility disability may have difficulty extricating themselves from the site of the blast (CDC, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3291">Biologic Weapons</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Biologic weapons</strong> are weapons that spread disease among the general population or the military. They can be used for sabotage, such as food or water contamination with a small target area or may be used by global terrorists with intentions to spread fear and disruption of daily life (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Effects of Biologic Weapons</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Biologic weapons are easily obtained and easily disseminated and can result in significant mortality and morbidity (see <a href="#tt68-5">Table 68-5</a>). The potential use of biologic weapons calls for continuous increased surveillance by health departments and an increased index of suspicion by clinicians. Many biologic weapons result in signs and symptoms similar to those of common disease processes. Appropriate management of a biologic threat includes rapid recognition of the potential weapon; the use of proper PPE; decontamination, isolation, or quarantine of patients who are infected when appropriate; and the administration of appropriate vaccinations, antidotes, or medications to people at risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Biologic weapons are delivered in either a liquid or a dry state, applied to foods or water, or vaporized for inhalation or direct contact. Vaporization may be accomplished through spray or explosives loaded with the weapon. Because of increase in travel by people in industrialized nations, a biologic weapon could be released in one city and affect people in other cities thousands of miles away. The vector can be an insect, animal, or person, or there may be direct contact with the weapon itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Two of the biologic agents most likely to be used or weaponized are discussed in the next section. <a href="#tt68-6">Table 68-6</a> describes other easily weaponized biologic agents.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Types of Biologic Weapons</h6>
<p class="h7a">Anthrax</p>
<p class="nonindent">Anthrax is recognized as the most likely weaponized biologic agent available and has been recognized as a highly debilitating agent for centuries. <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> is a naturally occurring gram-positive, encapsulated rod-shaped bacterium that lives in the soil in the spore state throughout the world. The bacterium sporulates (i.e., is liberated) when exposed to air and is infective only in the spore form. Contact with infected animal products (raw meat) or inhalation of the spores results in infection. Cattle and other herbivores are vaccinated against anthrax to prevent transmission through contaminated meat. As an aerosol, anthrax is odorless and invisible and can travel a great distance before disseminating; hence, the site of release and the site of infection can be miles apart (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h8">Clinical Manifestations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Anthrax is caused by replicating bacteria that release toxin, resulting in hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis. There are three main methods of infection: skin contact, gastrointestinal ingestion, and inhalation. Approximate incubation periods are 5 to 7 days (cutaneous), 1 to 6 days (gastrointestinal), and 1 to 43 days (inhalation). Skin lesions (the most common infection) cause edema with pruritus and macule or papule <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2233" title="2233"></span>formation, resulting in ulceration with 1- to 3-mm vesicles. A painless eschar develops, which falls off in 1 to 2 weeks (ENA, 2020).</p>

<p class="indent">Ingestion of anthrax results in fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally ascites. If severe diarrhea develops, decreased intravascular volume becomes the major treatment concern. The bacterium targets the terminal ileum and cecum. Sepsis can occur (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Inhaling anthrax results in severe clinical manifestations. Its symptoms mimic those of the flu, and usually treatment is sought only when the second stage of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2234" title="2234"></span>severe respiratory distress occurs. Antibiotic therapy does not halt the progress of the disease. Inhaled anthrax can incubate for up to 60 days, making it difficult to identify its source. Initial signs and symptoms include cough, headache, fever, vomiting, chills, weakness, mild chest discomfort, dyspnea, and syncope without rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. Most patients have a brief recovery period followed by the second stage within 1 to 3 days, characterized by fever, severe respiratory distress, stridor, hypoxia, cyanosis, diaphoresis, hypotension, and shock. These patients require optimization of oxygenation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and ventilatory and hemodynamic support. More than 50% of these patients have hemorrhagic mediastinitis on a chest x-ray (a hallmark sign). Inhalation anthrax may progress to include meningitis with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Death results approximately 24 to 36 hours after the onset of severe respiratory distress. The mortality rate approaches 100% (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h8">Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">At present, anthrax is penicillin sensitive; however, strains of penicillin-resistant anthrax are thought to exist. Recommended treatment includes penicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and doxycycline (ENA, 2020). If antibiotic treatment begins within 24 hours after exposure, death can be prevented. In a mass casualty situation, treatment with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is recommended, because these easily given oral antibiotic agents are stockpiled and there should be sufficient dosages to fully treat many patients who have been anthrax-exposed. Treatment is continued for 60 days. For patients who have been directly exposed to anthrax but have no signs and symptoms of disease, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is used for prophylaxis for 60 days (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Standard precautions are needed when caring for a patient infected with anthrax. The patient is not contagious, and the disease cannot spread from person to person. Equipment should be cleaned using standard hospital disinfectant. After death, cremation is recommended because the spores can survive for decades and represent a threat to morticians and forensic medicine personnel. A vaccination, which includes six doses is available for the Department of Defense, and the CDC is in the process of developing a civilian vaccination protocol (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h7">Smallpox</p>
<p class="nonindent">Smallpox (variola) is classified as a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus. It has an incubation period that ranges from 7 to 17 days. It is extremely contagious and spread by direct contact, by contact with clothing or linens, or by droplets from person to person only after the fever has decreased and the rash phase has begun (ENA, 2020). Aerosolization of the virus would result in widespread dissemination.</p>
<p class="indent">The WHO declared eradication of smallpox in 1977 and stopped worldwide vaccination in 1980. In the United States, the last child was vaccinated in 1972. Therefore, a large portion of the current population has no immunity to the virus. A smallpox vaccination plan, introduced in 2003, proposed that a designated number of ED staff receive the first vaccinations to ensure that ED staff would be immunized in the event of a smallpox outbreak. The government estimated that 0.1% of those people receiving the vaccine would have serious side effects. Of these, approximately 4% would have life-threatening complications, and 0.1% would die. Currently, only people with a high likelihood of exposure to smallpox are encouraged to receive the vaccination (CDC, 2017).</p>
<p class="h8">Clinical Manifestations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of smallpox infection include high fever, malaise, headache, backache, and prostration. After 1 to 2 days, a maculopapular rash appears, evolving at the same rate, beginning on the face, mouth, pharynx, and forearms. Only then does the rash progress to the trunk and become vesicular to pustular (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). There is a large amount of virus in the saliva and pustules. The person remains contagious until the rash crusts over and falls off (ENA, 2020). There are two forms of smallpox: variola major and variola minor. Variola major is more common, results in a higher fever and more extensive rash, and has a 30% case fatality rate (i.e., the likelihood of fatality per case diagnosed). Hemorrhagic smallpox, a subtype of variola major, includes all of the above signs and symptoms plus a dusky erythema and petechiae leading to frank hemorrhage of the skin and mucous membranes, and it results in death by day 5 or 6 (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment includes supportive care with antibiotic agents for any additional infection. Antivirals and immune globulin may aid in treatment; however, vaccination remains the most effective method of prevention (ENA, 2020). The patient should be isolated in a negative-pressure environment, using strict airborne and contact precautions. Laundry and biologic wastes should be autoclaved before being washed with hot water and bleach. Standard decontamination of the room is effective. All people who have household or face-to-face contact with the patient after the fever begins should be vaccinated within 4 days to prevent infection and death. A patient with a temperature of 38&#x00B0;C (101&#x00B0;F) or higher within 17 days after exposure must be placed in isolation. Cremation is preferred for all deaths, because the virus can survive in scabs for up to 13 years (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3292">Chemical Weapons</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Chemical weapons</strong> may be used as agents in warfare or for terrorist purposes. These are overt agents whose effects are more apparent and occur more quickly than those caused by biologic weapons (see <a href="#tt68-7">Table 68-7</a>). Poisonous exposure to everyday chemicals also may occur; the same management principles discussed later apply when patients are exposed to these chemical agents when not used as weapons. Typical exposures in these instances include industrial chemicals, gasoline, turpentine, kerosene, and insecticides (ENA, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Characteristics of Chemicals</h6>
<p class="h7a">Volatility</p>
<p class="nonindent">Volatility is the tendency for a chemical to become vapor. The most common volatile agents are phosgene and cyanide. Most chemicals are heavier than air, except for hydrogen cyanide. Therefore, in the presence of most chemicals, people <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2235" title="2235"></span>should stand up to avoid heavy exposure (because the chemical will sink toward the floor or ground).</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Persistence</p>
<p class="nonindent">Persistence means that the chemical is less likely to vaporize and disperse. More volatile chemicals do not evaporate very quickly. Most industrial chemicals (e.g., cyanide) are not very persistent. Weaponized agents (chemicals developed as weapons by the military or terrorists [e.g., mustard gas]) are more likely than industrial chemicals to penetrate the skin and mucous membranes and cause secondary exposure.</p>
<p class="h7">Toxicity</p>
<p class="nonindent">Toxicity is the potential of an agent to cause injury to the body. The median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) is the amount of the chemical that will cause death in 50% of those who are exposed. For example, cyanogen chloride has the highest LD<sub>50</sub>, twice that of hydrogen cyanide and eight times higher than sulfur mustard (OSHA, 2012). The median effective dose (ED<sub>50</sub>) is the amount of the chemical that will cause signs and symptoms in 50% of those who are exposed. The concentration time (CT) is the concentration released multiplied by the time exposed (in milligrams per minute). For example, if 1000 mg of a chemical is released and the time a person is exposed to this amount of chemical is 10 minutes, then the CT would be 10,000 mg/min.</p>
<p class="h7">Latency</p>
<p class="nonindent">Latency is the time from absorption to the appearance of signs and symptoms. Sulfur mustards and pulmonary agents have the longest latency, whereas other vesicants, nerve agents, and cyanide produce signs and symptoms within seconds.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Limiting Exposure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Evacuation is essential, as is removal of the person&#x2019;s clothing and decontamination as close to the scene as possible and before transport of the person who has been exposed. Soap and water are effective means of decontamination in most cases. Staff involved in decontamination efforts must wear PPE and contain and dispose of the runoff after decontamination procedures (ENA, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Types of Chemicals</h6>
<p class="h7a">Vesicants</p>
<p class="nonindent">Vesicants are chemicals that cause blistering and result in burning, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, hematopoietic suppression, and death. Examples of vesicants include lewisite, phosgene, nitrogen mustard, and sulfur mustard. In World War I and in the Iran&#x2013;Iraq conflict of 1980 to 1988, vesicants were used to disable opponents. Vesicants were the main incapacitating agents, resulting in minimal (less than 5%) death but large numbers of injuries (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). Liquid sulfur mustard was the most frequently used vesicant in these conflicts.</p>
<p class="h8">Clinical Manifestations</p>
<p class="nonindent">The initial presentation after exposure to a vesicant is similar to that of a large superficial to partial-thickness burn in the warm and moist areas of the body (i.e., perineum, axillae, antecubital spaces). There is stinging and erythema for approximately 24 hours, followed by pruritus, painful burning, and small vesicle formation after 2 to 18 hours. These vesicles can coalesce into large, fluid-filled bullae. Lewisite and phosgene result in immediate pain after exposure. Tissue damage occurs within minutes (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2235</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2236" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2236">p. 2236</span></div>
<p class="indent">If the eyes are exposed, there will be pain, photophobia, lacrimation, and decreased vision. This progresses to conjunctivitis, blepharospasm, corneal ulcer, and corneal edema.</p>
<p class="indent">Respiratory effects are more serious and often are the cause of mortality with vesicant exposure. Manifestations may include dyspnea, necrosis of large airway mucosa with sloughing, chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and ARDS which may lead to respiratory failure and death (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). Gastrointestinal exposure may cause nausea and vomiting, leukopenia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
<p class="h8">Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Appropriate decontamination includes soap and water. Scrubbing and the use of hypochlorite solutions should be avoided because they increase penetration. Once the substance has penetrated, it cannot be removed. Eye exposure requires copious irrigation. For respiratory exposure, intubation and bronchoscopy to remove necrotic tissue are essential. With lewisite exposure, dimercaprol is administered IV for systemic toxicity and topically for skin lesions. All persons with sulfur mustard exposures should be monitored for 24 hours for latent (delayed) effects (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h7">Nerve Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">The most toxic agents in existence are the nerve agents such as sarin, soman, tabun, and VX. They are inexpensive, effective in small quantities, and easily dispersed. In the liquid form, nerve agents evaporate into a colorless, odorless vapor. Organophosphates (pesticides) are similar in nature to the nerve agents used in warfare and are readily available in the farming industry (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">Nerve agents can be inhaled or absorbed percutaneously or subcutaneously. These agents bond with acetylcholinesterase so that acetylcholine is not inactivated; the adverse result is hyperstimulation (continuous stimulation) of the nerve endings. Carbamates, which are insecticides originally extracted from the Calabar bean, are derivatives of carbamic acid; they are nerve agents that specifically inhibit acetylcholinesterase for several hours and then spontaneously become unbound from the acetylcholinesterase. However, organophosphates require the formation of new enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) before nervous system function can be restored.</p>
<p class="indent">A very small drop of a nerve agent is enough to result in sweating and twitching at the site of exposure. A larger amount results in more systemic symptoms. Effects can begin anywhere from 30 minutes up to 18 hours after exposure. The more common organophosphates and carbamates (e.g., sevin, malathion) that are used in agriculture result in less severe symptoms than do those used in warfare or in terrorist attacks. In an ordinary situation (e.g., nonwarfare, nonterrorist attack situation), a patient could arrive at the ED having been unintentionally exposed to organophosphates or intentionally exposed to these agents in a suicidal attempt (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h8">Clinical Manifestations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of nerve gas exposure are those of cholinergic crisis and include bilateral miosis, visual disturbances, increased gastrointestinal motility, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, substernal spasm, indigestion, bradycardia and atrioventricular block, bronchoconstriction, laryngeal spasm, weakness, fasciculations, and incontinence. The patient must be examined in a dark area to truly identify miosis. Neurologic responses include insomnia, forgetfulness, impaired judgment, depression, and irritability. A lethal dose results in loss of consciousness, seizures, copious secretions, fasciculations, flaccid muscles, and apnea (ENA, 2019).</p>
<p class="h8">Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Decontamination with copious amounts of soap and water or saline solution for 8 to 20 minutes is essential. The water is blotted off, not wiped off, the skin. Wiping may have the unintended effect of rubbing more of the agent into the skin. Fresh 0.5% hypochlorite solution (bleach) can also be used. The airway is maintained, and suctioning is frequently required. Plastic airway equipment should not be used, because plastic will absorb sarin gas and may result in continued exposure to the agent.</p>
<p class="indent">Atropine 2 to 4 mg is administered by IV, followed by 2 mg every 3 to 8 minutes for up to 24 hours of treatment. Alternatively, IV atropine 1 to 2 mg per hour may be given until clear signs of anticholinergic activity have returned (decreased secretions, tachycardia, and decreased gastrointestinal motility). Another medication that may serve as an antidote is pralidoxime, which allows cholinesterase to become active against acetylcholine. Pralidoxime 1 to 2 g in 100 to 150 mL of normal saline solution is given over 15 to 30 minutes. Pralidoxime has no effect on secretions and may have any of the following side effects: hypertension, tachycardia, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, and diplopia. Diazepam or other benzodiazepines are used to control seizures, to decrease fasciculations, and to alleviate apprehension and agitation (ENA, 2020).</p>
<p class="h7">Blood Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Blood agents such as hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride have a direct effect on cellular metabolism, resulting in asphyxiation through alterations in hemoglobin. Cyanide is an agent that has profound systemic effects. It is commonly used in the mining of gold and silver and in the plastics and dye industries.</p>
<p class="indent">A cyanide release is often associated with the odor of bitter almonds. In house fires, cyanide is released during the combustion of plastics, rugs, silk, furniture, and other construction materials. There is a significant correlation between blood cyanide and carbon monoxide levels in patients who survive fires, and in some cases, the cause of death is cyanide poisoning (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Clinical Manifestations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cyanide can be ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. Cyanide is protein bound and inhibits aerobic metabolism, leading to respiratory muscle failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and death. Its inhalation results in flushing, tachypnea, tachycardia, nonspecific neurologic symptoms, stupor, coma, and seizure preceding respiratory arrest (ENA, 2019).</p>
<p class="h8">Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Rapid administration of amyl nitrate, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate is essential to the successful management of cyanide exposure. First, the patient is intubated and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2237" title="2237"></span>placed on a ventilator. Next, amyl nitrate pearls are crushed and placed in the ventilator reservoir to induce methemoglobinemia. Cyanide has a 20% to 25% higher affinity for methemoglobin than it does for hemoglobin; it binds methemoglobin to form either cyanomethemoglobin or sulfmethemoglobin. The cyanomethemoglobin is then detoxified in the liver by the enzyme rhodanese. Next, IV sodium nitrite is given to induce the rapid formation of methemoglobin. IV sodium thiosulfate is then given; it has a higher affinity for cyanide than methemoglobin and stimulates the conversion of cyanide to sodium thiocyanate, which can be excreted by the kidneys (ENA, 2019). Although they may be lifesaving, these emergency medications do have side effects&#x2014;sodium nitrite can result in severe hypotension, and thiocyanate can cause vomiting, psychosis, arthralgia, and myalgia.</p>
<p class="indent">The production of methemoglobin is contraindicated in patients with smoke inhalation, because they already have decreased oxygen-carrying capacity secondary to the carboxyhemoglobin produced by smoke inhalation. In facilities where a hyperbaric chamber is available, it may be used to provide oxygenation while the previously discussed therapies are initiated. An alternative suggested treatment for cyanide poisoning is hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12a</sub>). Hydroxocobalamin binds with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>). It must be administered IV in large doses (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>). Administration of hydroxocobalamin can result in a transient pink discoloration of mucous membranes, skin, and urine. In high doses, tachycardia and hypertension can occur, but they usually resolve within 48 hours.</p>
<p class="h7">Pulmonary Agents</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary agents such as phosgene and chlorine destroy the pulmonary membrane that separates the alveolus from the capillary bed, disrupting alveolar&#x2013;capillary oxygen transport mechanisms. Capillary leakage results in fluid-filled alveoli. Phosgene and chlorine both vaporize rapidly causing this pulmonary injury. Phosgene has the odor of freshly mown hay.</p>
<p class="indent">Signs and symptoms include pulmonary edema with shortness of breath, especially during exertion. An initial hacking cough is followed by frothy sputum production. A particulate air filter mask is the only protection required to protect health care personnel. Phosgene does not injure the eyes. In a review of a chlorine spill in South Carolina that exposed 155 patients, the most useful tool for identifying worsening symptoms was the pulse oximeter. Ordinary triage systems did not predict the severity of exposure (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3293">Nuclear Radiation Exposure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The threat of nuclear warfare or exposure to a radiologic weapon is very real with the availability of nuclear material and easily concealed simple devices, such as the so-called dirty bomb, for dispersal. A dirty bomb is a conventional explosive (e.g., dynamite) that is packaged with radioactive material that scatters when the bomb is detonated. It disperses radioactive material and may be called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;radiologic weapon:&lt;/b&gt; byproducts of radiation contamination that are used to cause morbidity and mortality in the general population or the military">radiologic weapon</button></strong>, but it is not a <em>nuclear</em> weapon, which uses a complex nuclear fission reaction that is thousands of times more devastating than the dirty bomb (<a href="#bib4754">Durakovic, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Sources of radioactive material include not only nuclear weapons but also reactors and simple radioactive samples, such as weapons-grade plutonium or uranium, freshly spent nuclear fuel, or medical supplies (e.g., radium, certain cesium isotopes) used in cancer treatments and radiology. Exposure to a large number of people can be accomplished by placing a radioactive sample in a public place. Thousands may be exposed this way; some may be immediately affected, and others may require health monitoring for many years to assess long-term effects (<a href="#bib4754">Durakovic, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Any terrorist act or unintentional radiation release can be sizable and may require the entire hospital and prehospital staff to be prepared, recognize signs and symptoms of exposure, and rapidly treat victims without contamination of personnel, visitors, patients, or the facility itself.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Types of Radiation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are in balance in the nucleus. The protons repel each other because they are all positively charged. The number of protons is specific for each element in the periodic table. There is a specific ratio of protons and neutrons for each different atom, and the result is element stability. When an element is radioactive, there is an imbalance in the nucleus, resulting from an excess of neutrons.</p>
<p class="indent">To achieve stability, a radioactive nuclide can eject particles until the most stable number (an even number) of protons and neutrons exists. A proton can become a neutron by ejecting a positron; conversely, a neutron can become a proton by ejecting a negative electron. An alpha particle is released when two protons and two electrons are ejected (beta particles are electrons).</p>
<p class="indent">Alpha particles cannot penetrate the skin. A thin layer of paper or clothing is all that is necessary to protect the skin from alpha radiation. However, this low-level radiation can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or injection (open wound). Only localized damage occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">Beta particles have the ability to moderately penetrate the skin to the layer in which skin cells are being produced. This high-energy radiation can cause skin damage if the skin is exposed for a prolonged period and can cause injury if beta particles penetrate the skin.</p>
<p class="indent">Gamma radiation is a short-wavelength electromagnetic energy that is emitted when there is excess core nucleus energy. Gamma particles are penetrating. Therefore, it is difficult to shield against gamma radiation. X-rays are an example of gamma radiation. Gamma radiation often accompanies both alpha particle and beta particle emission (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Measurement and Detection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radiation is measured in several different units. The <em>rad</em> is the basic unit of measurement. A rad is equivalent to 0.01 J of energy per kilogram of tissue. To determine the damaging effect of the rad, a conversion to the <em>rem</em> (roentgen equivalents man) is necessary. The rem reflects the type of radiation absorbed and the potential for damage. For example, 200,000 mrem results in mild radiation sickness (1 rem = 1000 mrem) (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>). Typical natural yearly exposure for a person is 360 mrem. Another important concept is <em>half-life.</em> The half-life of a radioactive product is the time it takes to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2238" title="2238"></span>lose half of its radioactivity.</p>
<p class="indent">The only way to detect radiation is through a device that determines the exposure per minute. There are various devices for this purpose. The Geiger counter (or Geiger&#x2013;M&#x00FC;ller survey meter) can measure background radiation quickly through detection of gamma radiation and some beta radiation. With high-level radiation, the Geiger counter may underestimate exposure. Other devices include the ionization chamber survey meter, alpha monitors, and dose rate meters (ENA, 2020). Personal dosimeters are simple tools that identify radiation exposure and are worn by radiology personnel every day.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Exposure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Exposure is affected by time, distance, and shielding. The longer a person is within the radiation area, the higher the exposure. In addition, the larger the amount of radioactive material in the area, the greater the exposure. The farther away the person is from the radiation source, the lower the exposure. Shielding from the radiation source also decreases exposure.</p>
<p class="indent">Three types of radiation-induced injury can occur: external irradiation, contamination with radioactive materials, and incorporation of radioactive material into body cells, tissues, or organs (ENA, 2020):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>External irradiation</em> exposure occurs when all or part of the body is exposed to radiation that penetrates or passes completely through the body. In this type of exposure, the person is not radioactive and does not require special isolation or decontamination measures. Irradiation does not necessarily constitute a medical emergency.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Contamination</em> occurs when the body is exposed to radioactive gases, liquids, or solids either externally or internally. If internal, the contaminant can be deposited within the body. Contamination requires immediate medical management to prevent incorporation.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Incorporation</em> is the actual uptake of radioactive material into the cells, tissues, and susceptible organs. The organs involved are usually the kidneys, bones, liver, and thyroid.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Sequelae of contamination and incorporation can occur days to years later. The thyroid gland can be largely protected from radiation exposure by administration of stable iodine (potassium iodide) before or promptly after the intake of radioactive iodine. Priorities in the treatment of any type of radiation exposure are always treatment for life-threatening injuries and illnesses first, followed by measures to limit exposure, contamination control, and finally decontamination (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Decontamination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hospital and community disaster plans should be in effect when managing a radiation disaster. Access restriction is essential to prevent contamination of other areas of the hospital. Triage outside the hospital is the most effective means of preventing contamination of the facility itself. Floors are covered to prevent tracking of contaminants throughout the treatment areas. Strict isolation precautions should be in effect. All air ducts and vents must be sealed to prevent spread. Waste is controlled through double-bagging and the use of plastic-lined containers outside of the facility. All radiation-contaminated waste must be disposed of in appropriate color-coded yellow and magenta canisters.</p>
<p class="indent">Staff are required to wear protective clothing, such as water-resistant gowns, two pairs of gloves, masks, caps, goggles, and booties. Dosimetry devices should be worn by all staff members participating in patient care. The radiation safety officer in the hospital should be notified immediately to assist with surveys (using a radiation survey meter) of the incoming patients and to provide dosimeters to all staff personnel involved in direct care of patients who have been exposed. There is minimal risk to staff if the patients are properly surveyed and decontaminated.</p>
<p class="indent">Each patient arriving at the hospital should first be surveyed with the radiation survey meter for external contamination and then directed toward the decontamination area as needed. The majority of patients can be safely decontaminated with soap and water. Decontamination occurs outside of the ED with a shower, collection pool, tarp, and collection containers for patient belongings, as well as soap, towels, and disposable paper gowns for patients. Water runoff needs to be contained. Patients who are uninjured can perform self-decontamination with handheld showers. After the patient has showered, a resurvey is conducted to determine whether the radioactive contaminants have been removed. Additional washings should occur until the patient is free of contamination. It is important to ensure that during showers, previously clean areas are not contaminated with runoff from the washed contaminated areas (e.g., hair should be washed in a position that protects the body from contamination). Wounds are irrigated and then covered with a water-resistant dressing prior to total body decontamination.</p>
<p class="indent">Internal contamination or incorporation requires decontamination through catharsis, gastric lavage with chelating agents (agents that bind with radioactive substances and are then excreted), or both. Samples of urine, feces, and vomitus are surveyed to determine internal contamination levels. Biologic samples are taken through nasal and throat swabs, and a complete blood count with differential is obtained (<a href="#bib4754">Tintinalli et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acute Radiation Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) can occur after exposure to radiation. It is the dose, rather than the source, that determines whether ARS develops. Factors that determine whether the patient&#x2019;s response to exposure will result in ARS include a high dose (minimum 100 rad) and rate of radiation with total body exposure and penetrating-type radiation. Age, medical history, and genetics also affect the outcome after exposure. The course is predictable. <a href="#tt68-8">Table 68-8</a> identifies the phases of ARS.</p>
<p class="indent">Each body system is affected differently in ARS. Systems with cells that rapidly reproduce are most commonly affected. The hematopoietic system is the first system affected and serves as an indicator of the severity of radiation exposure (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). A predictor of outcome is the absolute lymphocyte count at 48 hours after exposure. A significant exposure would be indicated by blood lymphocyte counts of 300 to 1200/mm<sup>3</sup>. Barrier precautions should be implemented to protect the patient from infection. Neutrophils decrease within 1 week, platelets decrease <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2239" title="2239"></span>within 2 weeks, and red blood cells decrease within 3 weeks. Hemorrhagic complications including fever and sepsis are common.</p>

<p class="indent">The gastrointestinal system, with its rapidly reproducing cells, is also readily affected by radiation. Doses of radiation required to produce symptoms are approximately 600 rad or higher. The gastrointestinal symptoms usually occur at the same time as the changes in the hematopoietic system. Nausea and vomiting occur within 2 hours after exposure. Sepsis, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and opportunistic infections can occur as complications. An ominous sign is the presence of high fever and bloody diarrhea; these typically appear on day 10 after exposure (ENA, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">The central nervous system is affected when the dose exceeds 1000 rad (ENA, 2019). The symptoms occur when damage to the blood vessels of the brain results in fluid leakage. Signs and symptoms include cerebral edema; nausea; vomiting; headache; and increased intracranial pressure, which heralds a poor outcome and imminent death. Central nervous system injury with this amount of exposure is irreversible and occurs before hematopoietic or gastrointestinal system symptoms appear. Cardiovascular collapse is usually seen in conjunction with these injuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Skin effects can also indicate the dose of radiation exposure. With an exposure of 600 to 1000 rad, erythema occurs; it can disappear within hours and then reappear. The patient who has been exposed must be evaluated hourly for the presence of erythema. With exposures greater than 1000 rad, desquamation (radiation dermatitis) of the skin occurs. Necrosis becomes evident within a few days to months at doses greater than 5000 rad (CDC, 2018c).</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary injury can occur when the radiation exposure occurs during a traumatic event such as a blast or burn. Trauma in addition to radiation exposure increases patient mortality. Attention must first be directed toward the primary assessment for trauma. Airway, breathing, circulation, and fracture reduction require immediate attention. All definitive treatments must occur within the first 48 hours. Thereafter, all surgical procedures should be delayed for 2 to 3 months because of the potential for delayed wound healing and the possible development of opportunistic infections several weeks after exposure (<a href="#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Survival</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are three categories of predicted survival after radiation exposure: probable, possible, and improbable. Triage of victims at the scene, after decontamination, is conducted using the routine system for disaster triage. Presenting signs and symptoms determine the potential for survival and therefore the category of predicted survival during triage.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Probable</em> survivors have either no initial symptoms or only minimal symptoms (e.g., nausea and vomiting), or these symptoms resolve within a few hours. These patients should have a complete blood count drawn and may be discharged with instructions to return if any symptoms recur.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Possible</em> survivors present with nausea and vomiting that persist for 24 to 48 hours. They experience a latent period, during which leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia occur. Barrier precautions and protective isolation are implemented if the patient&#x2019;s lymphocyte count is less than 1200/mm<sup>3</sup>. Supportive treatment includes administration of blood products, prevention of infection, and provision of enhanced nutrition.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Improbable</em> survivors have received more than 800 rad of total-body penetrating irradiation. People in this group demonstrate an acute onset of vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and shock. Any neurologic symptoms suggest a lethal dose of radiation (ENA, 2019). These patients still require decontamination to prevent further contamination of the area and of others. Personal protection is essential, because it is virtually impossible to fully decontaminate these patients; all of their internal organs have been irradiated. The survival time is variable; however, death usually occurs swiftly due to shock. If there are no neurologic symptoms, patients may be alert and oriented, similar to a patient with extensive burns. In a mass casualty situation, these patients would be triaged into the black category, where they will receive comfort measures and emotional support. If it is not a mass casualty situation, aggressive fluid and electrolyte therapies are essential.</p>

<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon09.png" alt=""/> You are one of the several nurses volunteering at a music festival. You suddenly hear a loud explosion and hundreds of attendees are screaming and scattering in all directions. You see people are bleeding and notice that some individuals are on the ground not moving. You know you need to organize efforts and provide care. What are the priority actions you should take in order to ensure the safety of yourself and others on the scene? How will information be communicated to the community? What strategies will you utilize in this situation to triage those who have been impacted? As EMS arrive, who will have priority to be transported to the hospital?</p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Last"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon18.png" alt=""/> You are working in the emergency department and caring for a patient who complains of a fever for the past 2 days, cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, and loss of appetite. You are concerned that this patient may have COVID-19. Identify the immediate precautions that you will need to implement when providing care for this patient. When conducting an assessment, what questions will you ask this patient? Discuss the education you will provide the patient and family to reduce the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the evidence-based resources you will use to support this education.</p>
