<h4 class="h4" id="s3257">Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is an acute toxic state that occurs as a result of sudden cessation of alcohol intake after a bout of heavy drinking or, more typically, after prolonged intake of alcohol. Severity of symptoms depends on how much alcohol was ingested and for how long. Delirium tremens, the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, may be precipitated by acute injury or infection (e.g., pneumonia, pancreatitis, hepatitis). Delirium tremens is a life-threatening condition and carries a high mortality rate if untreated (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Moore, Fuehrlein, &#x0026; Rosenheck, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome show signs of anxiety, uncontrollable fear, tremor, irritability, agitation, insomnia, and incontinence. Usually, all vital signs are elevated in the alcoholic toxic state. Approximately 5% of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome experience delirium tremens, which manifest with visual, tactile, olfactory, and auditory hallucinations that often are terrifying; the patient exhibits agitation. Autonomic overactivity occurs and is evidenced by tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, hyperthermia, and profuse perspiration. Classically, delirium tremens commence within approximately 48 to 96 hours after the last drink of alcohol (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Hoffman &#x0026; Weinhouse, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The goals of management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome are to give adequate sedation and support to allow the patient to rest and recover without danger of injury or peripheral vascular collapse. A physical examination is performed to identify preexisting or contributing illnesses or injuries (e.g., head injury, pneumonia). A drug history is obtained to elicit information that may facilitate adjustment of any sedative requirements. Baseline blood pressure is determined, because the patient&#x2019;s subsequent treatment may depend on blood pressure changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Usually, the patient is sedated as directed with a sufficient dosage of benzodiazepines to establish and maintain sedation, which reduces agitation, prevents exhaustion, prevents seizures, and promotes sleep. The patient should be calm, able to respond, and able to maintain an airway safely on their own. A variety of medications and combinations of medications are used (e.g., chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and clonidine). Haloperidol, esmolol, or midazolam may be given for delirium tremens. Dosages are adjusted according to the patient&#x2019;s symptoms (agitation, anxiety) and blood pressure response (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is placed in a calm, nonstressful environment (usually a private room) and observed closely. The room remains lighted to minimize the potential for illusions (visual misrepresentations) and hallucinations. Homicidal or suicidal responses may result from hallucinations. Closet and bathroom doors are closed to eliminate shadows. A staff member is designated to stay with the patient as much as possible. The presence of another person has a reassuring and calming effect, which helps the patient maintain contact with reality. To orient the patient to reality, any illusions are explained.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Restraints are used as prescribed, if necessary, if the patient is aggressive or violent, but only when other alternatives have been unsuccessful. The patient who is restrained must be watched continuously on a one-on-one basis by an ED staff member. The least restrictive device that will prevent injury to the patient or others is used. Caution is taken to ensure that restraints are applied properly and that they are not impairing circulation to any part of the patient&#x2019;s body or interfering with respirations. Restraints should be used in tandem with verbal intervention to calm the patient and promote adherence. Restraints must be released according to protocol. Physical observation (e.g., skin integrity, circulatory status, respiratory status) is ongoing, and the patient&#x2019;s response is documented.</em></p></div>

<p class="indent">Fluid losses may result from GI losses (vomiting), profuse perspiration, and hyperventilation. In addition, the patient may be dehydrated as a result of alcohol&#x2019;s effect of decreasing antidiuretic hormone. The oral or IV route is used to restore fluid and electrolyte balance.</p>
<p class="indent">Temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are recorded frequently (every 30 minutes with delirium tremens) to monitor for peripheral circulatory collapse or hyperthermia (the two most serious complications).</p>
<p class="indent">Frequently seen complications include infections (e.g., pneumonia), trauma, hepatic failure, hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular problems. Hypoglycemia may accompany alcohol withdrawal syndrome because alcohol depletes liver glycogen stores and impairs gluconeogenesis; many patients with alcoholism also are malnourished. Parenteral dextrose may be prescribed if the liver glycogen level is depleted. Orange juice, sports drinks, or other sources of carbohydrates are given to stabilize the blood glucose level and counteract tremulousness. Supplemental vitamin therapy and a high-protein diet are provided as prescribed to counteract nutritional deficits. The patient should be referred to an alcoholic treatment center for follow-up care and rehabilitation.</p>
