<h4 class="h4" id="s1091">Anemia</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anemia:&lt;/b&gt; decreased red blood cell (RBC) count">Anemia</button></strong> is a condition characterized by a lower-than-normal hemoglobin concentration. Fewer than the normal number of red blood cells (RBCs), also called <strong>erythrocytes</strong>, are present in the circulation. Subsequently, less oxygen reaches the tissues, causing a variety of signs and symptoms. Rather than a disease state, anemia is a sign of an underlying disorder. It is the most common of all hematologic conditions and is prevalent throughout the world (Bunn, 2017a; Nair, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1092">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anemia is classified in several ways (see <a href="#tt29-1">Table 29-1</a>). Most often it is classified according to whether the decreased number of erythrocytes is associated with hypoproliferation (decreased production), hemolysis (increased destruction), or loss of cells through bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypoproliferative anemias occur when the bone marrow produces an inadequate number of erythrocytes. Decreased erythrocyte production results in a low or inappropriately normal <strong>reticulocyte</strong> (i.e., immature RBC) count. Causes of hypoproliferative anemia may include bone marrow damage from chemicals (e.g., benzene) or medication (e.g., chloramphenicol), lack of important factors that promote erythrocyte production such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythropoietin:&lt;/b&gt; hormone produced primarily by the kidney; necessary for erythropoiesis">erythropoietin</button></strong>, or lack of nutrients, including iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid.</p>
<p class="indent">In hemolytic anemias, premature destruction of erythrocytes results in the liberation of hemoglobin from the erythrocytes into the plasma; the released hemoglobin is converted in large part to bilirubin and, therefore, the bilirubin concentration rises. The increased erythrocyte destruction leads to tissue hypoxia, which in turn stimulates erythropoietin production. This increased production is reflected in an increased reticulocyte count as the bone marrow responds to the loss of erythrocytes. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemolysis:&lt;/b&gt; destruction of RBCs with release of cellular components into the circulation; may occur within or outside the vasculature">Hemolysis</button></strong> (destruction of RBCs with release of cellular components into the circulation) can result from an abnormality within the erythrocyte itself (e.g., sickle cell disease [SCD], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G-6-PD] deficiency), within the plasma (e.g., immune hemolytic anemias), or from direct injury to the erythrocyte within the circulation (e.g., hemolysis caused by a mechanical heart valve). <a href="#ct29-1">Chart 29-1</a> identifies causes of hemolytic anemias.</p>
<p class="indent">It is often possible to determine the cause of anemia in each patient based on the following factors:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The ability of the bone marrow to respond to the decrease in erythrocytes by producing reticulocytes.</span></li>
<li><span>The degree to which immature erythrocytes proliferate in the bone marrow and their ability to mature (as seen in a bone marrow biopsy).</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1093">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several factors influence the development of symptoms associated with anemia. The severity of the anemia, the rapidity with which the anemia developed, the duration (chronicity) of the anemia, metabolic requirements of the patient, the presence of other conditions, such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, and complications or related features of the condition that produced the anemia are some of these factors.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, the more quickly the anemia develops, the more severe the symptoms (Bunn, 2017a). An otherwise healthy patient may be able to tolerate as much as a 50% reduction in hemoglobin over several months without pronounced symptoms or significant incapacity; however, a rapid loss of 30% of the hemoglobin over minutes may lead to profound vascular collapse in the same person. A patient who gradually becomes anemic, such as a woman experiencing heavy menses over several months with hemoglobin levels between 9 and 11 g/dL, may have few or no symptoms except for slight tachycardia on exertion or fatigue.</p>
<p class="indent">People who are more active or who have significant life demands are more likely to have symptoms than those who are more sedentary. Patients with hypothyroidism with decreased oxygen demands may be asymptomatic without tachycardia or dyspnea with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL. Similarly, those with co-existing cardiac, vascular, or pulmonary disease may develop pronounced symptoms of anemia (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain, muscle pain, or cramping) with a higher hemoglobin level than those without concurrent health problems. Some anemias, such as SCD, or autoimmune diseases are often complicated by other abnormalities that do not result from the anemia but are inherent with the associated disease. Pain and other symptoms may overshadow those caused by the anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Complications of severe anemia include heart failure, paresthesias, and delirium. Patients with underlying heart disease are more likely to have angina and symptoms associated with heart failure than those without heart disease. Complications of specific types of anemia are included in the description of each type.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1094">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A number of studies are performed to determine the type and cause of the anemia. Initial evaluation includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and RBC indices, including mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red cell distribution width (RDW). Other studies may include iron studies (serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity [TIBC], percent saturation, and ferritin), serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folate levels, haptoglobin, and erythropoietin levels (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Elder, Winland-Brown, &#x0026; Porter, 2019</a>; <a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Nair, 2018</a>). The remaining complete blood count (CBC) values are also useful in determining if the anemia is an isolated condition or associated with another hematologic condition such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;leukemia:&lt;/b&gt; uncontrolled proliferation of WBCs">leukemia</button></strong> (i.e., malignancy of the WBCs) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)<strong>.</strong> Bone marrow aspiration may be performed to asses for cellular abnormalities. Additional studies such as colonoscopy or upper endoscopy may be performed to determine if underlying conditions causing the anemia are present. Lesions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract including ulcers, polyps, or tumors may be sources of blood loss.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1095">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of anemia is directed toward correcting or controlling the cause of the anemia; if the anemia is severe, the erythrocytes that are lost or destroyed may be replaced with a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Management of the various types of anemia is covered in the discussions that follow.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1096"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anemia is the most common hematologic condition affecting older adults, particularly those admitted to hospitals and in long-term care facilities. The overall prevalence of anemia is 17% in older adults, including approximately 10% of community-dwelling older adults, 45% of nursing homes residents, and 40% of those who are hospitalized. Most have mild anemia with hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL or higher, but even mild anemia may be associated with decreased functional ability and increased morbidity and mortality. Mild anemia in older adults is associated with decreased physical performance, decreased mobility, increased frailty, increased depression, increased risk of falls, and delirium (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Lanier, Park, &#x0026; Callahan, 2018</a>). Studies have identified an association <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page912" title="912"></span>between anemia and cognitive decline. Older adults with anemia are more likely to have fatigue, dyspnea, and confusion because of reduced cardiac reserve and inability to respond with an increase in heart rate and increased cardiac output. Those with preexisting renal and cardiac disease and those who have had recent surgery are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality when anemic (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Stauder, Valent, &#x0026; Theurl, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitle"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nursing process:&lt;/b&gt; a systematic, problem-solving approach for meeting people&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs; components involve assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation">NURSING PROCESS</button></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse17"><strong>The Patient with Anemia</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The health history and physical examination provide important data about the type of anemia involved, the extent and type of symptoms it produces, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient&#x2019;s life. Weakness, fatigue, and general malaise are common symptoms, and pallor of the skin and mucous membranes (conjunctivae, oral mucosa) are common signs (<a href="#ff29-1">Fig. 29-1</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Jaundice, angular cheilitis (inflammation and fissures in the corners of the mouth), and brittle, concave, ridged nails may be associated with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;megaloblastic anemia:&lt;/b&gt; a type of anemia characterized by abnormally large, nucleated RBCs">megaloblastic anemia</button></strong> (characterized by abnormally large, nucleated RBCs) or hemolytic anemia. The tongue may be sore and beefy red in megaloblastic anemia, and smooth and red with iron deficiency anemia. Patients with iron deficiency anemia often experience pica, a craving for ice, starch, or dirt (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2118">Cadet, 2018</a>). Restless leg syndrome is also common among those with iron deficiency anemia (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2180">Van Wyk, 2018</a>). The health history should include a medication history because some medications may depress bone marrow activity, induce hemolysis, interfere with folate metabolism, or cause GI irritation that leads to bleeding. An accurate social history should include alcohol intake, noting the amount consumed and the duration of alcohol use. Family history is also important since some types of anemia are inherited. The nurse should also inquire about athletic endeavors since extreme forms of exercise such as marathon running may influence erythropoiesis and erythrocyte survival (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Leung, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A nutritional assessment is needed because it may indicate deficiencies in essential nutrients such as iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and folate. People who follow strict vegetarian diets and do not supplement with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are at risk for megaloblastic anemia. Older adults may also have decreased intake of foods rich in vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or folate.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Cardiac status should be assessed carefully. When hemoglobin levels are low, the heart attempts to compensate by pumping faster and harder to deliver more oxygen to hypoxic tissue. This increased cardiac workload can result in symptoms including tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, orthopnea, and exertional dyspnea. Heart failure may eventually develop, evidenced by cardiomegaly (an enlarged heart), hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), and peripheral edema.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">GI assessment may reveal complaints of nausea, vomiting (with specific questions regarding the appearance of any emesis [e.g., looks like &#x201C;coffee grounds&#x201D;]), melena (dark stools), diarrhea, anorexia, and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Stool should be tested for occult blood. Women should be asked about their menstrual periods (e.g., excessive flow, other vaginal bleeding) and the use of iron and vitamin supplements during pregnancy. Neurologic examination is important because pernicious anemia with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency affects the function of the central and peripheral nervous systems (see later discussion). Examination should include assessment for the presence and extent of peripheral numbness and paresthesia, ataxia, impaired coordination, and confusion. Delirium can sometimes result from other types of anemia, particularly in older adults. It is important to monitor relevant laboratory results over time and note any changes (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> F<span class="small">ATIGUE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The most common symptom and complication of anemia is fatigue. Fatigue is often the symptom with the greatest negative impact on the patient&#x2019;s ability to function and subsequent quality of life. Fatigue is often described as overwhelming or oppressive. The sensation of fatigue may be severe even when the anemia is not severe enough to warrant transfusion. Fatigue may interfere with the patient&#x2019;s ability to engage in work as well as pleasurable activities with family and friends. Significant distress can stem from the inability to meet life&#x2019;s demands and responsibilities and the need to rely on others for assistance.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing interventions can focus on assisting the patient to prioritize activities to establish a balance between activity and rest that is acceptable to the patient. Patients with chronic anemia will need assistance in establishing a program of activity and exercise to avoid deconditioning associated with inactivity. It is also important to assess for other conditions that may contribute to fatigue, such as pain, depression, and sleep disturbances.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">AINTAINING</span> A<span class="small">DEQUATE</span> N<span class="small">UTRITION</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Inadequate intake of essential nutrients, including iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid and protein, can cause some forms of anemia. The symptoms associated with anemia (fatigue, anorexia) can interfere with maintaining adequate nutritional intake. A well-balanced diet should be encouraged. The nurse should advise the patient that alcohol can interfere with utilization of some essential nutrients and recommend limited alcohol intake (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2177">Stouten, Riedel, Droogendijk, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Dietary education involving family members when possible should be individualized to address specific needs and include cultural preferences for food preparation and selection (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). Dietary supplements (e.g., vitamins and iron) may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Equally important, the patient and family need to understand the role of nutritional supplements in the proper context. Some forms of anemia are not associated with nutritional deficiency. In some cases, excessive use of supplements will not improve the anemia and may be harmful. For example, patients with anemia who receive long-term transfusion therapy are at risk for iron overload from their transfusions. In this situation chelation therapy is implemented to reduce accumulation of excess iron (Murray, De Gelder, Pringle, et&#x00A0;al., 2016; see <a href="c30.xhtml">Chapter 30</a> for discussion of chelation therapy). The use of oral iron supplements may exacerbate the situation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<span class="small">ANAGING</span> A<span class="small">CTIVITY</span> I<span class="small">NTOLERANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients with severe anemia, with acute blood loss from hemorrhage or severe hemolysis, may not tolerate decreased blood volume or reduced circulating erythrocytes. Lost volume can be replaced with transfusions or intravenous fluids based on symptoms and laboratory test results. Supplemental oxygen may be needed, especially if there is underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease. Monitoring the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and pulse oximetry, especially with activity, is an important nursing action. Medications, including antihypertensive drugs, may need to be adjusted or withheld based on the patient&#x2019;s vital signs.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> E<span class="small">FFECTIVE</span> M<span class="small">ANAGEMENT OF</span> P<span class="small">RESCRIBED</span> T<span class="small">HERAPY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Medications, including nutritional supplements, are frequently prescribed for patients with anemia. It is important that patients understand the purpose of these therapies, how to take them, and how to manage side effects of treatment. Nurses play an important role in promoting adherence to the prescribed plan by educating patients and family caregivers about ways to incorporate the therapeutic plan in daily activities. For example, side effects of oral iron supplements including GI distress may make adherence to treatment difficult for some patients and may contribute to some patients stopping treatment. Nurses can provide important education and support to assist patients to cope with side effects. Abrupt cessation of some medications, including high-dose steroids for treatment of hemolytic anemia, can have serious consequences for patients. The cost of some medications, such as hematologic growth factors, can be quite high. Patients requiring these medications may need assistance to find alternative ways to obtain the necessary medication. Nurses may need to collaborate with social workers or other health care team members to assist patients in meeting these needs.</p>

<p class="processppara">A significant complication of anemia is heart failure associated with chronic diminished blood volume and the heart&#x2019;s compensatory effort to increase cardiac output. Patients with anemia should be assessed for signs and symptoms of heart failure (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In megaloblastic anemias associated with folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, there is potential for neurologic complications. Neurologic assessment of patients with megaloblastic anemia should be performed. Patients may complain of paresthesias, often manifested by numbness and, as the anemia progresses, symptoms worsen and other signs become apparent. Position and vibration sense may be diminished. Difficulty maintaining balance and gait disturbances may occur. Mental status changes, beginning with confusion and progressing to more severe memory changes and delirium can occur with severe folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2087">Elder et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
