<p class="nonindent">Arrhythmias include sinus, atrial, junctional, and ventricular arrhythmias and their various subcategories, as well as conduction abnormalities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s815">Sinus Node Arrhythmias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sinus node arrhythmias originate in the SA node; these include sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sinus Bradycardia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sinus bradycardia occurs when the SA node creates an impulse at a slower-than-normal rate. Causes include lower metabolic needs (e.g., sleep, athletic training, hypothyroidism), vagal stimulation (e.g., from vomiting, suctioning, severe pain), medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers [e.g., nifedipine, amiodarone], beta-blockers [e.g., metoprolol]), idiopathic sinus node dysfunction, increased intracranial pressure, and coronary artery disease, especially myocardial infarction (MI) of the inferior wall. Unstable and symptomatic bradycardia is frequently due to hypoxemia. Other possible causes include acute altered mental status (e.g., delirium) and acute decompensated heart failure (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1692">Fuster et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Sinus bradycardia has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-6">Fig.&#x00A0;22-6</a>):</p>

<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Less than 60 bpm in the adult</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Regular</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Usually normal, but may be regularly abnormal</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> Normal and consistent shape; always in front of the QRS</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> Consistent interval between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 1:1</p>
<p class="indent">All characteristics of sinus bradycardia are the same as those of normal sinus rhythm, except for the rate. The patient is assessed to determine the hemodynamic effect and the possible cause of the arrhythmia. If the decrease in heart rate results from stimulation of the vagus nerve, such as with bearing down during defecation or vomiting, attempts are made to prevent further vagal stimulation. If the bradycardia is caused by a medication such as a beta-blocker, the medication may be withheld. If the slow heart rate causes significant hemodynamic changes resulting in shortness of breath, acute alteration of mental status, angina, hypotension, ST-segment changes, or premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), treatment is directed toward increasing the heart rate. Slow heart rate may be due to sinus node dysfunction (previously known as <em>sick sinus syndrome</em>), which has a number of risk factors including increased body mass index, presence of right and left bundle branch block, history of a major cardiovascular event, increased age, and hypertension (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1712">Jackson, Rathakrishnan, Campbell, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). <em>Tachy-brady syndrome</em> is the term used when bradycardia alternates with tachycardia.</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Management depends on the cause and symptoms. Resolving the causative factors may be the only treatment needed. If the bradycardia produces signs and symptoms of clinical instability (e.g., acute alteration in mental status, chest discomfort, or hypotension), 0.5 mg of atropine may be given rapidly as an intravenous (IV) bolus and repeated every 3 to 5 minutes until a maximum dosage of 3 mg is given. Rarely, if the bradycardia is unresponsive to atropine, emergency transcutaneous pacing can be instituted, or medications, such as dopamine, isoproterenol, or epinephrine, are given (Kusumoto, Schoenfeld, Barrett, et&#x00A0;al., 2019; see later discussion).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sinus Tachycardia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sinus tachycardia occurs when the sinus node creates an impulse at a faster-than-normal rate. Causes may include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Physiologic or psychological stress (e.g., acute blood loss, anemia, shock, hypervolemia, hypovolemia, heart failure, pain, hypermetabolic states, fever, exercise, anxiety)</span></li>
<li><span>Medications that stimulate the sympathetic response (e.g., catecholamines, aminophylline, atropine), stimulants (e.g., caffeine, nicotine), and illicit drugs (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy)</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced automaticity of the SA node and/or excessive sympathetic tone with reduced parasympathetic tone that is out of proportion to physiologic demands, a condition called <em>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</em></span></li>
<li><span>Autonomic dysfunction, which results in a type of sinus tachycardia referred to as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS is characterized by tachycardia without hypotension, and by presyncopal symptoms such as palpitations, lightheadedness, weakness, and blurred vision, which occur with sudden posture changes</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Sinus tachycardia has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-7">Fig.&#x00A0;22-7</a>):</p>

<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Greater than 100 bpm in the adult, but usually less than 120 bpm</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Regular</p>

<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> Normal and consistent shape; always in front of the QRS, but may be buried in the preceding T wave</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> Consistent interval between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 1:1</p>
<p class="indent">All aspects of sinus tachycardia are the same as those of normal sinus rhythm, except for the rate. Sinus tachycardia does not start or end suddenly (i.e., it is nonparoxysmal). As the heart rate increases, the diastolic filling time decreases, possibly resulting in reduced cardiac output and subsequent symptoms of syncope (fainting) and low blood pressure. If the rapid rate persists and the heart cannot compensate for the decreased ventricular filling, the patient may develop acute pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of sinus tachycardia is determined by the severity of symptoms and directed at identifying and abolishing its cause. Vagal maneuvers, such as carotid sinus massage, gagging, bearing down against a closed glottis (as if having a bowel movement), forceful and sustained coughing, and applying a cold stimulus to the face (such as applying an ice-cold wet towel to the face), or administration of adenosine should be considered to interrupt the tachycardia. If the tachycardia is persistent and causing hemodynamic instability (e.g., acute alteration in mental status, chest discomfort, hypotension), synchronized <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardioversion:&lt;/b&gt; electrical current given in synchrony with the patient&#x2019;s own QRS complex to stop an arrhythmia">cardioversion</button></strong> (i.e., electrical current given in synchrony with the patient&#x2019;s own QRS complex to stop an arrhythmia) is the treatment of choice, if vagal maneuvers and adenosine are unsuccessful or not feasible (see later discussion). IV beta-blockers (Class II antiarrhythmic) and calcium channel blockers (Class IV antiarrhythmic) (see <a href="#tt22-1">Table&#x00A0;22-1</a>) may also be considered in treating hemodynamically stable sinus tachycardia, although synchronized cardioversion may be used if medications are ineffective or contradicted (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1725">Page, Joglar, Caldwell, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Catheter ablation (see later discussion) of the SA node may be used in cases of persistent inappropriate sinus tachycardia unresponsive to other treatments. Treatment for POTS often involves a combination of approaches, with treatment targeted at the underlying problem. For example, patients with hypovolemia may be advised to increase their fluid and sodium intake, or use salt tablets if necessary.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Sinus Arrhythmia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sinus arrhythmia occurs when the sinus node creates an impulse at an irregular rhythm; the rate usually increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration. Nonrespiratory causes include heart disease and valvular disease, but these are rare. Sinus arrhythmia has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-8">Fig.&#x00A0;22-8</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> 60 to 100 bpm in the adult</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Irregular</p>

<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 1:1</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sinus arrhythmia does not cause any significant hemodynamic effect and therefore is not typically treated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s816">Atrial Arrhythmias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Atrial arrhythmias originate from foci within the atria and not the SA node. These include aberrancies such as premature atrial complexes (PACs) as well as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Premature Atrial Complex</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A PAC is a single ECG complex that occurs when an electrical impulse starts in the atrium before the next normal impulse of the sinus node. The PAC may be caused by caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, stretched atrial myocardium (e.g., as in hypervolemia), anxiety, hypokalemia (low potassium level), hypermetabolic states (e.g., with pregnancy), or atrial ischemia, injury, or infarction. PACs are often seen with sinus tachycardia. PACs have the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-9">Fig.&#x00A0;22-9</a>):</p>

<p class="indent">PACs are common in normal hearts. The patient may say, &#x201C;My heart skipped a beat.&#x201D; A pulse deficit (a difference between the apical and radial pulse rate) may exist.</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">If PACs are infrequent; no treatment is necessary. If they are frequent (more than six per minute), this may herald a worsening disease state or the onset of more serious arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. Medical management is directed toward treating the underlying cause (e.g., reduction of caffeine intake, correction of hypokalemia).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Atrial Fibrillation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia; between 2.7 and 6.1 million Americans are living with atrial fibrillation (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1701">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017</a>). Atrial fibrillation is a serious public health concern because it is associated with aging, and the older adult population is increasing in the United States (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1702">Chen, Chung, Allen, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Atrial fibrillation can result from diverse pathophysiologic etiologies and risks (see <a href="#ct22-2">Chart&#x00A0;22-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Atrial fibrillation results from abnormal impulse formation that occurs when structural or electrophysiologic abnormalities alter the atrial tissue causing a rapid, disorganized, and uncoordinated twitching of the atrial musculature (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1714">January, Wann, Alpert, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January, Wann, Calkins, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Both the extrinsic (central) and intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous systems (CANS) are thought to play an important role in the initiation and continuance of atrial fibrillation (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Qin, Zeng, &#x0026; Liu, 2019</a>). Separate from the extrinsic (central) nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, the CANS consists of a highly interconnected network of autonomic ganglia and nerve cell bodies embedded within the epicardium, largely within the atrial myocardium and great vessels (pulmonary veins). Hyperactive autonomic ganglia in the CANS are thought to play a critical role in atrial fibrillation, resulting in impulses that are initiated from the pulmonary veins and conducted through to the AV node. The ventricular rate of response depends on the conduction of atrial impulses through the AV node, presence of accessory electrical conduction pathways, and therapeutic effect of medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Lack of consistency in describing patterns or types of atrial fibrillation has led to the use of numerous labels, such as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;paroxysmal:&lt;/b&gt; arrhythmia that has a sudden onset and terminates spontaneously; usually of short duration, but may recur">paroxysmal</button></strong> (i.e., sudden onset with spontaneous termination), persistent, and permanent. The recommended classification system is noted in <a href="#ct22-3">Chart&#x00A0;22-3</a>. The use of the term &#x201C;chronic atrial fibrillation&#x201D; is no longer included in the classification system, due to a lack of consensus on what constitutes chronicity (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Atrial fibrillation has the following characteristics (<a href="#ff22-10">Fig.&#x00A0;22-10</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Atrial rate is 300 to 600 bpm; ventricular rate is usually 120 to 200 bpm in untreated atrial fibrillation</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Highly irregular</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Usually normal, but may be abnormal</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> No discernible P waves; irregular undulating waves that vary in amplitude and shape are seen and referred to as fibrillatory or f waves</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> Cannot be measured</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> Many:1</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and embolic events such as stroke (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). A rapid and irregular ventricular response reduces the time for ventricular filling, resulting in a smaller stroke volume. Because atrial fibrillation causes a loss in AV synchrony (the atria and ventricles contract at different times), the atrial kick (the last part of diastole and ventricular filling, which accounts for 25% to 30% of the cardiac output) is also lost. As a consequence, although some patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, others experience palpitations and clinical manifestations of heart failure (e.g., shortness of breath, hypotension, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue; see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). In addition, a high ventricular rate of response during atrial fibrillation (greater than 80 bpm) can eventually lead to mitral valve dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, intraventricular conduction delays, and dilated ventricular cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with atrial fibrillation may exhibit a pulse deficit&#x2014;a numeric difference between apical and radial pulse rates. The shorter time in diastole reduces the time available for coronary artery perfusion, thereby increasing the risk of myocardial ischemia with the onset of anginal symptoms (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). Decreasing the ventricular rate may avoid and correct these effects.</p>
<p class="indent">The erratic nature of atrial contraction, alterations in ventricular ejection, and atrial myocardial dysfunction promote the formation of thrombi, especially within the left atrium, increasing the risk of an embolic event. The origin of embolisms resulting in stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is most often the left atrial appendage (LAA) (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1729">Schellinger, Tsivgoulis, Steiner, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). A therapeutic approach to addressing the role of the LAA in atrial fibrillation, left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="h7">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</p>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical evaluation of atrial fibrillation should include a history and physical examination that identifies the onset and nature of signs and symptoms, including their frequency, duration and any precipitating factors, and any response to medications. Whether or not the patient has a known history of heart disease or other risks is identified (see <a href="#ct22-2">Chart&#x00A0;22-2</a>). A 12-lead ECG is performed to verify the atrial fibrillation rhythm, as well as to identify the presence (or absence) of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, bundle branch block, prior myocardial ischemia, or other arrhythmias. The RR, QRS, and QT intervals are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of any prescribed antiarrhythmic medications (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can identify the presence of valvular heart disease, provide information about LV and right ventricular (RV) size and function, RV pressures (to identify pulmonary hypertension, which may exist concomitant with atrial fibrillation), LV hypertrophy, and presence of left atrial thrombi (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Blood tests to screen for diseases that are known risks for atrial fibrillation (see <a href="#ct22-2">Chart&#x00A0;22-2</a>), including thyroid, renal, and hepatic function, are assessed in the patient with a new onset of atrial fibrillation, as well as when the ventricular rate is difficult to control (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Additional tests may include a chest x-ray (to evaluate pulmonary vasculature in a patient suspected of having pulmonary hypertension), exercise stress test (to exclude myocardial ischemia or reproduce exercise-induced atrial fibrillation), Holter or event monitoring (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>), and an EPS (January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019; see later discussion).</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of atrial fibrillation depends on the cause, pattern, and duration of the arrhythmia, the ventricular response rate, as well as the presence of structural or valvular heart disease and other cardiac conditions such as coronary artery disease or heart failure. Strategies for both rhythm control (i.e., conversion to sinus rhythm) and rate control are dependent on shared clinical decision making between the patient and primary provider. In some cases, atrial fibrillation spontaneously converts to sinus rhythm within 24 to 48 hours and without treatment. However, in instances where atrial fibrillation is concomitant with significant other morbid conditions (e.g., severe heart failure), the atrial fibrillation may be classified as &#x201C;permanent,&#x201D; meaning that the patient and primary provider have made a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore or maintain sinus rhythm. Therefore, management of atrial fibrillation may not only be different in different patients, but it also may change over time for any one patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical management revolves around preventing embolic events such as stroke with anticoagulant medications, controlling the ventricular rate of response with antiarrhythmic agents, and treating the arrhythmia as indicated so that it is converted to a sinus rhythm (i.e., <em>cardioversion</em>).</p>
<p class="h8">Pharmacologic Therapy</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pink_c22"><strong>Antithrombotic Medications.</strong></span> Antithrombotic drugs may include anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs. Oral antithrombotic therapy is indicated for most patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (e.g., absence of mechanical heart valve) because it reduces the risk of stroke (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Atrial fibrillation guidelines recommend use of a scoring system to assist in assessment of stroke risk. Antithrombotic therapy is then selected based on risk factors outlined in the mnemonic CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VAS<sub>C</sub> (see <a href="#ct22-4">Chart&#x00A0;22-4</a>) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page701" title="701"></span>with each risk factor assigned points tallied for a total score that indicates an overall risk of stroke (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">According to pharmacologic treatment guidelines (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VAS<sub>C</sub> score of zero may choose the option of no antithrombotic therapy.</span></li>
<li><span>Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VAS<sub>C</sub> score of one may choose no antithrombotic therapy, treatment with an oral anticoagulant, or aspirin.</span></li>
<li><span>Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VAS<sub>C</sub> score of 2 or higher for men and 3 or higher for women may choose warfarin, or a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., dabigatran), or a Factor Xa inhibitor (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban).</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Patients with atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease or bioprosthetic heart valves may be prescribed warfarin, or a direct-acting oral anticoagulant, or a Factor Xa inhibitor (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1720">Malik, Yandrapalli, Aronow, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). For patients with mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). If immediate or short-term anticoagulation is necessary, the patient may be placed on IV or low&#x2013;molecular-weight heparin until warfarin therapy can be started and the international normalized ratio (INR) level reaches a therapeutic range consistent with antithrombosis, usually defined as an INR between 2.0 and 3.0 (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Medication selection for all patients with atrial fibrillation depends upon stroke and bleeding risks as well as patient preferences and values (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). For instance, treatment with warfarin will require weekly INR testing during initiation of therapy, as well as ongoing monitoring (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion). Home monitoring of therapy is an option for some patients. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants and Factor Xa inhibitors require baseline assessment of hemoglobin and hematocrit, as well as liver and renal function, along with INR. Advantages of these medications include fewer drug&#x2013;drug interactions and dietary limitations, as well as the elimination of frequent INR testing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="vol_c22"><strong>Medications that Control the Heart Rate.</strong></span> A strategy to control the ventricular rate of response so that the resting heart rate is less than 80 bpm is recommended in order to manage symptoms of atrial fibrillation (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). To decrease the ventricular rate in patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation, a beta-blocker (Class II antiarrhythmic, see <a href="#tt22-1">Table&#x00A0;22-1</a>) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (Class IV antiarrhythmic, see <a href="#tt22-1">Table&#x00A0;22-1</a>) is generally recommended (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="vol_c22"><strong>Medications that Convert the Heart Rhythm or Prevent Atrial Fibrillation.</strong></span> For patients with atrial fibrillation lasting 48 hours or longer, anticoagulation is recommended prior to attempts to restore sinus rhythm, which may be achieved through pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). In the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation, TEE may be performed prior to cardioversion to identify left atrial thrombus formation, including in the LAA (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). If no thrombus is identified, cardioversion can proceed.</p>
<p class="indent">Medications that may be given to achieve pharmacologic cardioversion to sinus rhythm include flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, amiodarone, and IV ibutilide (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). These medications are most effective if given within 7 days of the onset of atrial fibrillation. It is recommended that patients who were prescribed dofetilide be hospitalized so that the QT interval and renal function both may be monitored. Despite a degree of risk, dofetilide is a preferred medication because it is highly effective at converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm, has fewer drug-to-drug interactions, and is better tolerated by patients than other medications. Some patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation may be prescribed flecainide to self-administer at home, an approach referred to as &#x201C;pill in the pocket&#x201D; (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperative administration of beta-blockers (see <a href="#tt22-1">Table&#x00A0;22-1</a>) has resulted in a significant reduction in atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1698">Burrage, Low, Campbell, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also called statins; see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, Table&#x00A0;23-1) may also be prescribed to prevent new-onset atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1698">Burrage et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is refractory to at least one Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic medication (see <a href="#tt22-1">Table&#x00A0;22-1</a>), and rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation may be indicated (January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019; see later discussion).</p>
<p class="h8">Electrical Cardioversion for Atrial Fibrillation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Electrical cardioversion is indicated for patients with atrial fibrillation who are hemodynamically unstable (e.g., acute alteration in mental status, chest discomfort, hypotension) and do not respond to medications (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol may be given prior to cardioversion to enhance the success of cardioversion and maintain sinus rhythm (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The patient with atrial fibrillation is at high risk for thrombus formation. When electrical cardioversion is indicated, the nurse may anticipate that a transesophageal echocardiogram may be performed to evaluate for possible atrial thrombi.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Because atrial function may be impaired for several weeks after cardioversion, antithrombotic therapy (e.g., warfarin) is indicated for at least 4 weeks after the procedure (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Repeated attempts at electrical cardioversion may be made, following administration of an antiarrhythmic medication (see later discussion on Electrical Cardioversion).</p>
<p class="h7">Cardiac Rhythm Therapies</p>
<p class="nonindent">Atrial fibrillation that does not respond to medications or electrical cardioversion may be treated by cardiac rhythm therapies, including catheter ablation, maze or mini-maze procedure, or convergent procedure.</p>
<p class="h8">Catheter Ablation Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Catheter <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ablation:&lt;/b&gt; purposeful destruction of heart muscle cells, usually in an attempt to correct or eliminate an arrhythmia">ablation</button></strong> destroys specific cells that are the cause of a tachyarrhythmia. Catheter ablation is performed most often today for atrial fibrillation, although it may also be useful in treating atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) (see later discussion of these arrhythmias).</p>
<p class="indent">Atrial fibrillation is associated with intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system activity to the pulmonary veins. Ablation involves a procedure similar to a cardiac catheterization (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>); however, in this instance, a special catheter is advanced at or near the origin of the arrhythmia, where high-frequency, low-energy sound waves are passed through the catheter, causing thermal injury, localized cell destruction, and scarring. The tissue damage is more specific to the arrhythmic tissue, with less trauma to the surrounding cardiac tissue. Ablation may also be accomplished using a special catheter to apply extremely cold temperature to destroy selected cardiac cells, called <em>cryoablation.</em> The goal of each of these ablation procedures is to eliminate the arrhythmia, by preventing the ectopic activity arising from the pulmonary veins from reaching the atria, thereby stopping fibrillation (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Weber, Sagerer-Gerhardt, &#x0026; Heinze, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An EPS (see later discussion) may be performed to induce the arrhythmia prior to the catheter ablation. During the ablation procedure, defibrillation pads, an automatic blood pressure cuff, and a pulse oximeter are used. The patient is usually given moderate sedation (see <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>) and IV heparin to reduce the risk of periprocedural thromboembolism. Immediately postablation, the patient is monitored for another 30 to 60 minutes and then retested to ensure that the arrhythmia does not recur. Successful ablation is achieved when the arrhythmia cannot be induced. Major risks of catheter ablation include pericardial effusion and tamponade, phrenic nerve injury, stroke, hematoma, retroperitoneal bleeding, pulmonary vein stenosis, and atrioesophageal fistulas (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Canpolat, Kocyigit, &#x0026; Aytemir, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="vol_c22"><strong>Nursing Management.</strong></span> Postprocedural care on a step-down unit for the patient who has had ablation is similar to the nursing management of a patient who has had a cardiac catheterization (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>); the patient is monitored closely to ensure recovery from sedation. Postprocedural nursing interventions include frequent monitoring for arrhythmias and for signs and symptoms of a stroke and vascular access site complications. Because of the prolonged time required for the procedure as well as the time needed in bed to obtain hemostasis at the vascular access site, it is not unusual for the patient to have back discomfort. In addition to administering any pain medications, the nurse may help to alleviate this pain by placing rolled towels under the patient&#x2019;s knees and waist.</p>
<p class="h8">Maze and Mini-Maze Procedures</p>
<p class="nonindent">The maze procedure is an open heart surgical procedure for refractory atrial fibrillation. Small transmural incisions are made throughout the atria. The resulting formation of scar tissue prevents reentry conduction of the aberrant electrical impulse. Because the procedure requires significant time and cardiopulmonary bypass, its use is reserved only for those patients undergoing cardiac surgery for another reason (e.g., coronary artery bypass; January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019). Some patients may need a permanent pacemaker after this surgery because of subsequent injury to the SA node.</p>
<p class="indent">A modification of the maze procedure, minimally invasive maze surgery, or mini-maze, may be performed by making small incisions between the ribs, through which video-guided instruments are inserted. The pulmonary veins are encircled with surgical incisions within the left atrium. This surgery eliminates the need for opening the sternum, heart&#x2013;lung bypass, and the use of cardioplegia (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for further discussion of cardiac surgery). This results in a shorter recovery time and a lower risk of infection (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Convergent Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">The convergent procedure utilizes a hybrid approach to ablation, requiring the skills of both a cardiothoracic surgeon and an electrophysiologist, a cardiologist with specialized training. This procedure is associated with lower rates of arrhythmia recurrence than catheter ablation, but more complications within 30 days of the procedure (e.g., infections, bleeding) (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1713">Jan, Zizek, Gersak, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The surgeon creates a few small incisions in the abdomen so that a special catheter that allows visualization can be inserted through the diaphragm and toward the posterior wall of the heart. The surgeon performs ablation of the epicardial wall in the area around the pulmonary veins and the electrophysiologist performs ablation around the endocardial area of the pulmonary veins. Because of the incisions, the patient usually has a 3-day hospital length of stay (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Elrod, 2014</a>). The patient may experience mild dull chest pain caused by the resulting inflammation from the ablation that usually resolves within a few days (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Elrod, 2014</a>). This pain is usually alleviated by treatment with acetaminophen as needed. In addition, if the phrenic nerve was affected, the patient may experience shortness of breath that may take days to weeks to resolve (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Elrod, 2014</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion</p>
<p class="nonindent">LAAO is an alternative to antithrombotic medications for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1721">Masoudi, Calkins, Kavinsky, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). As noted previously, the LAA is the area where the majority of stroke-causing blood clots form in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, concerns about the risk of long-term anticoagulant use and the risk of bleeding can complicate effective management (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1724">Ojo, Yandrapalli, Veseli, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Candidates for LAAO include those patients with increased risk of stroke based on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VAS<sub>C</sub> scores of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page703" title="703"></span>one or higher (see <a href="#ct22-4">Chart&#x00A0;22-4</a>) and those patients seeking a nonpharmacologic alternative to treatment (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1721">Masoudi et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). Commonly used is the WATCHMAN, a device typically inserted while the patient is under general anesthesia. Similar to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>), a small incision is made in the femoral area and a catheter is then inserted that guides the device into position. The parachute-shaped device is threaded through to the opening of the LAA, sealing it off and preventing it from releasing clots (see <a href="#ff22-11">Fig.&#x00A0;22-11</a>).</p>

All rights reserved.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Patients typically stay in the hospital overnight after placement of a WATCHMAN device. The nursing management of patients who received this device is similar to that of patients post cardiac catheterization (see Chapter&#x00A0;21). Patients are prescribed aspirin and warfarin post procedure; approximately 6 weeks post procedure, they should return to the cardiology clinic for a TEE to confirm that the device has effectively occluded the LAA. If LAAO has occurred, then the patient may stop taking warfarin and is prescribed clopidogrel, an antiplatelet medication. After 6 months, the patient may stop taking clopidogrel but must continue taking daily aspirin indefinitely (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Carlson &#x0026; Doshi, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">In the patient with atrial fibrillation, if the QRS is wide and the ventricular rhythm is very fast and irregular, an accessory pathway should be suspected. An accessory pathway is typically congenital tissue between the atria, bundle of His, AV node, Purkinje fibers, or ventricular myocardium. This anomaly is known as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice for atrial fibrillation in the presence of WPW syndrome that causes hemodynamic instability. Medications that block AV conduction (e.g., digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil) should be avoided in WPW because they can increase the ventricular rate. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or amiodarone are recommended to restore sinus rhythm (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Catheter ablation is performed for long-term management (see previous discussion).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Atrial Flutter</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Atrial flutter occurs because of a conduction defect in the atrium and causes a rapid, regular atrial impulse at a rate between 250 and 400 bpm. Because the atrial rate is faster than the AV node can conduct, not all atrial impulses are conducted into the ventricle, causing a therapeutic block at the AV node. This is an important feature of this arrhythmia. If all atrial impulses were conducted to the ventricle, the ventricular rate would also be 250 to 400 bpm, which would result in ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening arrhythmia. Atrial flutter risk factors mirror those for atrial fibrillation (Fuster et&#x00A0;al., 2017; see <a href="#ct22-2">Chart&#x00A0;22-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Atrial flutter has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-12">Fig.&#x00A0;22-12</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Atrial rate ranges between 250 and 400 bpm; ventricular rate usually ranges between 75 and 150 bpm</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> The atrial rhythm is regular; the ventricular rhythm is usually regular but may be irregular because of a change in the AV conduction</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Usually normal, but may be abnormal or absent</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> Saw-toothed shape; these waves are referred to as F waves</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> Multiple F waves may make it difficult to determine the PR interval</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Atrial flutter can cause serious signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and low blood pressure. Medical management involves the use of vagal maneuvers (see previous discussion under Sinus Tachycardia) or a trial administration of adenosine, which causes sympathetic block and slowing of conduction through the AV node. This may terminate the tachycardia; optimally, it will facilitate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page704" title="704"></span>visualization of flutter waves for diagnostic purposes. Adenosine is given IV by rapid administration, and immediately followed by a 20-mL saline flush and elevation of the arm with the IV line to promote rapid circulation of the medication.</p>

<p class="indent">Atrial flutter is treated with antithrombotic therapy, rate control, and rhythm control in the same manner as atrial fibrillation (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1715">January et&#x00A0;al., 2014, 2019</a>). Electrical cardioversion is often successful in converting atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (see later discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s817">Junctional Arrhythmias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Junctional arrhythmias originate within AV nodal tissue, and may include premature junctional complexes, junctional rhythms, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia, and AV nodal reentry tachycardia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Premature Junctional Complex</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A premature junctional complex is an impulse that starts in the AV nodal area before the next normal sinus impulse reaches the AV node. Premature junctional complexes are less common than PACs. Causes include digitalis toxicity, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. The ECG criteria for premature junctional complex are the same as for PACs, except for the P wave and the PR interval. The P wave may be absent, may follow the QRS, or may occur before the QRS but with a PR interval of less than 0.12 seconds. This arrhythmia rarely produces significant symptoms. Treatment for frequent premature junctional complexes is the same as for frequent PACs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Junctional Rhythm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Junctional or idionodal rhythm occurs when the AV node, instead of the sinus node, becomes the pacemaker of the heart. When the sinus node slows (e.g., from increased vagal tone) or when the impulse cannot be conducted through the AV node (e.g., because of complete heart block), the AV node automatically discharges an impulse. Junctional rhythm not caused by complete heart block has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-13">Fig.&#x00A0;22-13</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Ventricular rate 40 to 60 bpm; atrial rate also 40 to 60 bpm if P waves are discernible</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Regular</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Usually normal, but may be abnormal</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> May be absent, after the QRS complex, or before the QRS; may be inverted, especially in lead II</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> If the P wave is in front of the QRS, the PR interval is less than 0.12 seconds</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 1:1 or 0:1</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Junctional rhythm may produce signs and symptoms of reduced cardiac output. If this occurs, the treatment is the same as for sinus bradycardia. Emergency pacing may be needed (see later discussion under Pacemaker Therapy).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nonparoxysmal Junctional Tachycardia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Junctional tachycardia is caused by enhanced automaticity in the junctional area, resulting in a rhythm similar to junctional rhythm, except at a rate of 70 to 120 bpm. Although this rhythm generally does not have any detrimental hemodynamic effect, it may indicate a serious underlying condition, such as digitalis toxicity, myocardial ischemia, hypokalemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">AVNRT is a common arrhythmia that occurs when an impulse is conducted to an area in the AV node that causes the impulse to be rerouted back into the same area over and over again at a very fast rate. Each time the impulse is conducted through this area, it is also conducted down into the ventricles, causing a fast ventricular rate. AVNRT that has an abrupt onset and an abrupt cessation with a QRS of normal duration has frequently been called <em>paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT)</em> and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page705" title="705"></span>also <em>paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).</em> AVNRT also occurs when the duration of the QRS complex is 0.12&#x00A0;seconds or greater and a block in the bundle branch is known to be present. This arrhythmia may last for seconds or several hours. Factors associated with the development of AVNRT include caffeine, nicotine, hypoxemia, and stress. Underlying pathologies include coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy; however, it occurs more often in females and not in association with underlying structural heart disease. AVNRT has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-14">Fig.&#x00A0;22-14</a>):</p>

Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Atrial rate usually 150 to 250 bpm; ventricular rate usually 120 to 200 bpm</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Regular; sudden onset and termination of the tachycardia</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Usually normal, but may be abnormal</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> Usually very difficult to discern</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> If the P wave is in front of the QRS, the PR interval is less than 0.12 seconds</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 1:1, 2:1</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical symptoms vary with the rate and duration of the tachycardia and the patient&#x2019;s underlying condition. The tachycardia usually is of short duration, resulting only in palpitations. A fast rate may also reduce cardiac output, resulting in significant signs and symptoms such as restlessness, chest pain, shortness of breath, pallor, hypotension, and loss of consciousness.</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because AVNRT is generally a benign arrhythmia, the goal of medical management is to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Patients who become significantly symptomatic and require emergency department visits to terminate the rhythm may want to initiate therapy immediately. However, those with minimum symptoms with an AVRNT that terminates spontaneously or with minimal treatment may choose just to be monitored and self-treat.</p>
<p class="indent">The aim of therapy is to break the reentry of the impulse. Catheter ablation is the initial treatment of choice and is used to eliminate the area that permits the rerouting of the impulse that causes the tachycardia (Katritsis, 2018; see previous discussion of Atrial Fibrillation: Catheter Ablation Therapy). Vagal maneuvers (see previous discussion under Sinus Tachycardia) may be used to interrupt AVNRT. These techniques increase parasympathetic stimulation, causing slower conduction through the AV node and blocking the reentry of the rerouted impulse. Some patients use some of these methods to terminate the episode on their own. Because of the risk of a cerebral embolic event, carotid sinus massage, which may be performed by physicians, is contraindicated in patients with carotid artery disease.</p>
<p class="h8">Pharmacologic Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">If the vagal maneuvers are ineffective, the patient may then receive a bolus of adenosine to correct the rhythm; this is usually effective in terminating AVNRT. Because the effect of adenosine is so short, AVNRT may recur; the first dose may be followed with two additional doses. If the vagal maneuvers and adenosine are ineffective, IV non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil), IV beta-blockers or IV digoxin may be considered (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Hafeez &#x0026; Armstrong, 2019</a>). If the patient is unstable or does not respond to the medications, electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">If P waves cannot be identified, the rhythm may be called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), or PSVT if it has an abrupt onset, until the underlying rhythm and resulting diagnosis is determined. SVT and PSVT indicate only that the rhythm is not VT. SVT could be atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or AVNRT, among others. Vagal maneuvers and adenosine may be used to convert the rhythm or at least slow conduction in the AV node to allow visualization of the P&#x00A0;waves.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s818">Ventricular Arrhythmias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ventricular arrhythmias originate from foci within the ventricles; these may include premature ventricular complexes, VT, ventricular fibrillation, and idioventricular rhythms. Technically, ventricular asystole is characterized by an absence of rhythm formation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Premature Ventricular Complex</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A PVC is an impulse that starts in a ventricle and is conducted through the ventricles before the next normal sinus impulse. PVCs can occur in healthy people, especially with intake of caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol. PVCs may be caused by cardiac ischemia or infarction, increased workload on the heart (e.g., heart failure and tachycardia), digitalis toxicity, hypoxia, acidosis, or electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia.</p>
<p class="indent">In a rhythm referred to as bigeminy, every other complex is a PVC. In trigeminy, every third complex is a PVC, and in quadrigeminy, every fourth complex is a PVC. PVCs have the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-15">Fig.&#x00A0;22-15</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Depends on the underlying rhythm (e.g., sinus rhythm)</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Irregular due to early QRS, creating one RR interval that is shorter than the others. The PP interval may be regular, indicating that the PVC did not depolarize the sinus node</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Duration is 0.12 seconds or longer; shape is bizarre and abnormal. When these bizarrely shaped, widened QRS complexes resemble each other, they are called unifocal. When they have at least two different morphologic appearances, they are called multifocal</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> Visibility of the P wave depends on the timing of the PVC; may be absent (hidden in the QRS or T wave) or in front of the QRS. If the P wave follows the QRS, the shape of the P wave may be different</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> If the P wave is in front of the QRS, the PR interval is less than 0.12 seconds</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 0:1; 1:1</p>

<p class="indent">The patient may feel nothing or may say that the heart &#x201C;skipped a beat.&#x201D; The effect of a PVC depends on its timing in the cardiac cycle and how much blood was in the ventricles when they contracted. Initial treatment is aimed at correcting the cause.</p>

PVCs are not considered a warning for ensuing VT. However, studies have shown an association of PVCs with adverse outcomes; therefore, patients may need to be evaluated for underlying causes (e.g., ischemic heart disease and LV dysfunction) (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1695">Al-khatib et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6"> <img class="m" src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>Ventricular Tachycardia</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">VT is defined as three or more PVCs in a row, occurring at a rate exceeding 100 bpm. The causes are similar to those of PVC. Patients with larger MIs and lower ejection fractions are at higher risk of lethal VT. VT is an emergency because the patient is nearly always unresponsive and pulseless. VT has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-16">Fig.&#x00A0;22-16</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Ventricular rate is 100 to 200 bpm; atrial rate depends on the underlying rhythm (e.g., sinus rhythm)</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> Usually regular; atrial rhythm may also be regular</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Duration is 0.12 seconds or more; bizarre, abnormal shape</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> Very difficult to detect, so the atrial rate and rhythm may be indeterminable</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> Very irregular, if P waves are seen</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> Difficult to determine, but if P waves are apparent, there are usually more QRS complexes than P waves</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s tolerance or lack of tolerance for this rapid rhythm depends on the ventricular rate and severity of ventricular dysfunction.</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Several factors determine the initial treatment, including the following: identifying the rhythm as monomorphic (having a consistent QRS shape and rate) or polymorphic (having varying QRS shapes and rhythms), determining the existence of a prolonged QT interval before the initiation of VT, any comorbidities, and ascertaining the patient&#x2019;s heart function (normal or decreased). If the patient is stable, continuing the assessment, especially obtaining a 12-lead ECG, may be the only action necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may need antiarrhythmic medications, antitachycardia pacing, or direct cardioversion or defibrillation. Procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol, and lidocaine are all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page707" title="707"></span>antiarrhythmic medications that may be considered based upon type of VT (e.g., monomorphic or polymorphic), clinical presentation, and patient comorbidities (e.g., impaired cardiac function, acute MI).</p>

<p class="indent">Cardioversion is the treatment of choice for monophasic VT in a patient who is symptomatic. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;defibrillation:&lt;/b&gt; electrical current given to stop an arrhythmia, not synchronized with the patient&#x2019;s QRS complex">Defibrillation</button></strong>, which uses an electrical current given to stop the arrhythmia that is not set to synchronize with the patient&#x2019;s QRS complex, is the treatment of choice for pulseless VT. Any type of VT in a patient who is unconscious and without a pulse is treated in the same manner as ventricular fibrillation: immediate defibrillation is the action of choice (see later discussion on Cardioversion and Defibrillation).</p>
<p class="indent">For long-term management, patients with an ejection fraction less than 35% should be considered for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) (see later discussion). Those with an ejection fraction greater than 35% may be managed with antiarrhythmic medication.</p>
<p class="indent">Torsades de pointes is a polymorphic VT preceded by a prolonged QT interval, which could be congenital or acquired. Common causes include central nervous system disease; certain medications (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, haloperidol, lithium, methadone); or low levels of potassium, calcium, or magnesium. Congenital QT prolongation is another cause. Because this rhythm is likely to cause the patient to deteriorate and become pulseless, immediate treatment is required and includes correction of any electrolyte imbalance, such as administration of IV magnesium, and with IV isoproterenol or pacing if associated with bradycardia (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link, Berkow, Kudenchuk, et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar, Donnino, Maconochie, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"> <img class="m" src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>Ventricular Fibrillation</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The most common arrhythmia in patients with cardiac arrest is ventricular fibrillation, which is a rapid, disorganized ventricular rhythm that causes ineffective quivering of the ventricles. No atrial activity is seen on the ECG. The most common cause of ventricular fibrillation is coronary artery disease and resulting acute MI. Other causes include untreated or unsuccessfully treated VT, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, several proarrhythmic medications, acid&#x2013;base and electrolyte abnormalities, and electrical shock. Another cause is Brugada syndrome, in which the patient (frequently of Asian descent) has a structurally normal heart, few or no risk factors for coronary artery disease, and a family history of sudden cardiac death (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1741">Pappone &#x0026; Santinelli, 2019</a>). Ventricular fibrillation has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-17">Fig.&#x00A0;22-17</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular rate:</em> Greater than 300 bpm</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular rhythm:</em> Extremely irregular, without a specific pattern</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Irregular, undulating waves with changing amplitudes. There are no recognizable QRS complexes</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ventricular fibrillation is always characterized by the absence of an audible heartbeat, a palpable pulse, and respirations. Because there is no coordinated cardiac activity, cardiac arrest and death are imminent if the arrhythmia is not corrected. Early defibrillation is critical to survival, with administration of immediate bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation is available. For refractory ventricular fibrillation, administration of amiodarone and epinephrine may facilitate the return of a spontaneous pulse after defibrillation (Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015; see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for further discussion on interventions during Cardiac Arrest).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Idioventricular Rhythm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Idioventricular rhythm, also called <em>ventricular escape rhythm,</em> occurs when the impulse starts in the conduction system below the AV node. When the sinus node fails to create an impulse (e.g., from increased vagal tone) or when the impulse is created but cannot be conducted through the AV node (e.g., due to complete AV block), the Purkinje fibers automatically discharge an impulse. When idioventricular rhythm is not caused by AV block, it has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-18">Fig.&#x00A0;22-18</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular rate:</em> Between 20 and 40 bpm; if the rate exceeds 40 bpm, the rhythm is known as accelerated idioventricular rhythm</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular rhythm:</em> Regular</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Bizarre, abnormal shape; duration is 0.12 seconds or more</p>

<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Idioventricular rhythm commonly causes the patient to lose consciousness and experience other signs and symptoms of reduced cardiac output. In such cases, the treatment is the same as for asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>) if the patient is in cardiac arrest or for bradycardia if the patient is not in cardiac arrest. Interventions include identifying the underlying cause; administering IV epinephrine, atropine, and vasopressor medications; and initiating emergency transcutaneous pacing. In some cases, idioventricular rhythm may cause no symptoms of reduced cardiac output.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ventricular Asystole</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Commonly called <em>flatline,</em> ventricular asystole is characterized by absent QRS complexes confirmed in two different leads, although P waves may be apparent for a short duration. There is no heartbeat, no palpable pulse, and no respiration. Without immediate treatment, ventricular asystole is fatal.</p>
<p class="h7">Medical Management</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ventricular asystole is treated the same as PEA, focusing on high-quality CPR with minimal interruptions and identifying underlying and contributing factors. The key to successful treatment is a rapid assessment to identify a possible cause, which is known as the Hs and Ts: hypoxia, hypovolemia, hydrogen ion (acid&#x2013;base imbalance), hypo- or hyperglycemia, hypo- or hyperkalemia, hypothermia, trauma, toxins, tamponade (cardiac), tension pneumothorax, or thrombus (coronary or pulmonary) (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>). After the initiation of CPR, intubation and establishment of IV access are the next recommended actions, with no or minimal interruptions in chest compressions (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s819">Conduction Abnormalities</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When assessing the rhythm strip, the underlying rhythm is first identified (e.g., sinus rhythm, sinus arrhythmia). Then, the PR interval is assessed for the possibility of an AV block. AV blocks occur when the conduction of the impulse through the AV node or bundle of His area is decreased or stopped. These blocks can be caused by medications (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers), Lyme disease, myocardial ischemia and infarction, hypothyroidism, or activities that cause an increase in vagal tone (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1717">Kusumoto et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If the AV block is caused by increased vagal tone (e.g., long-term athletic training, sleep, coughing, suctioning, pressure above the eyes or on large vessels, anal stimulation), it is commonly accompanied by sinus bradycardia. AV block may be temporary and resolve on its own, or it may be permanent and require permanent pacing.</p>
<p class="indent">The clinical signs and symptoms of a heart block vary with the resulting ventricular rate and the severity of any underlying disease processes. Whereas first-degree AV block rarely causes any hemodynamic effect, the other blocks may result in decreased heart rate, causing a decrease in perfusion to vital organs, such as the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and skin. A patient with third-degree AV block caused by digitalis toxicity may be stable; another patient with the same rhythm caused by acute MI may be unstable. Health care providers must always keep in mind the need to treat the patient, not the rhythm. The treatment is based on the hemodynamic effect of the rhythm.</p>
<h6 class="h6">First-Degree Atrioventricular Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">First-degree AV block occurs when all the atrial impulses are conducted through the AV node into the ventricles at a rate slower than normal. This conduction disorder has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-19">Fig.&#x00A0;22-19</a>):</p>

<h6 class="h6">Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block, Type I (Wenckebach)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Second-degree AV block, type I, occurs when there is a repeating pattern in which all but one of a series of atrial impulses are conducted through the AV node into the ventricles (e.g., every four of five atrial impulses are conducted). Each atrial impulse takes a longer time for conduction than the one before, until one impulse is fully blocked. Because the AV node is not depolarized by the blocked atrial impulse, the AV node has time to fully repolarize so that the next atrial impulse can be conducted within the shortest amount of time. Second-degree AV block, type I, has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-20">Fig.&#x00A0;22-20</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Depends on the underlying rhythm, but the ventricular rate is lower than the atrial rate</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rhythm:</em> The PP interval is regular if the patient has an underlying normal sinus rhythm; the RR interval characteristically reflects a pattern of change. Starting from the RR that is the longest, the RR interval gradually shortens until there is another long RR interval</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>QRS shape and duration:</em> Usually normal, but may be abnormal</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P wave:</em> In front of the QRS complex; shape depends on underlying rhythm.</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>PR interval:</em> The PR interval becomes longer with each succeeding ECG complex until there is a P wave not followed by a QRS. The changes in the PR interval are repeated between each &#x201C;dropped&#x201D; QRS, creating a pattern in the irregular PR interval measurements</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>P:QRS ratio:</em> 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, and so forth</p>
<h6 class="h6">Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block, Type II</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Second-degree AV block, type II, occurs when only some of the atrial impulses are conducted through the AV node into the ventricles. Second-degree AV block, type II, has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-21">Fig.&#x00A0;22-21</a>):</p>
<p class="un_midd_c21"><em>Ventricular and atrial rate:</em> Depends on the underlying rhythm, but the ventricular rate is lower than the atrial rate</p>

<h6 class="h6">Third-Degree Atrioventricular Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Third-degree AV block occurs when no atrial impulse is conducted through the AV node into the ventricles. In third-degree AV block, two impulses stimulate the heart: one stimulates the ventricles, represented by the QRS complex, and one stimulates the atria, represented by the P wave. P waves may be seen, but the atrial electrical activity is not conducted down into the ventricles to initiate the QRS complex, the ventricular electrical activity. Having two impulses stimulate the heart results in a condition referred to as AV dissociation, which may also occur during VT. Complete <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page710" title="710"></span>block (third-degree AV block) has the following characteristics (see <a href="#ff22-22">Fig.&#x00A0;22-22</a>):</p>

<h6 class="h6">Medical Management of Conduction&#x00A0;Abnormalities</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Based on the cause of the AV block and the stability of the patient, treatment is directed toward increasing the heart rate to maintain a normal cardiac output. If the patient is stable and has no symptoms, no treatment may be indicated or it may simply consist of decreasing or eliminating the cause (e.g., withholding the medication or treatment). If the causal medication is necessary for treating other conditions and no effective alternative is available, pacemaker implantation may be indicated. The initial treatment of choice is an IV bolus of atropine, although it is not effective in second-degree AV block, type II, or third-degree AV block. If the patient does not respond to atropine, has advanced AV block, or has had an acute MI, temporary transcutaneous pacing may be started. If the patient has no pulse, treatment is the same as for ventricular asystole (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1718">Link et&#x00A0;al., 2015</a>; <a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1732">Soar et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). A permanent pacemaker may be necessary if the block persists (see later discussion).</p>

<p class="processppara">Major areas of assessment include possible causes of the arrhythmia, contributing factors, and the arrhythmia&#x2019;s effect on the heart&#x2019;s ability to pump an adequate blood volume. When cardiac output is reduced, the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues and vital organs is diminished. This diminished oxygenation produces the signs and symptoms associated with arrhythmias. If these signs and symptoms are severe or if they occur frequently, the patient may experience significant distress and disruption of daily life.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">A health history is obtained to identify any previous occurrences of decreased cardiac output, such as syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, chest discomfort, and palpitations. Possible causes of the arrhythmia (e.g., heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) need to be identified. All medications, prescribed and over-the-counter (including herbs and nutritional supplements), as well as the route of administration, are reviewed. If a patient is taking an antiarrhythmic medication, assessment for treatment adherence, side effects, adverse reactions, and potential contraindications is necessary. For example, some medications (e.g., digoxin) can cause arrhythmias. Laboratory results are reviewed to assess levels of medications as well as factors that could contribute to the arrhythmia (e.g., anemia). A thorough psychosocial assessment is performed to identify the possible effects of the arrhythmia, the patient&#x2019;s perception and understanding of the arrhythmia and its treatment, and whether anxiety is a significant contributing factor.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse conducts a physical assessment to confirm the data obtained from the history and to observe for signs of diminished cardiac output during the arrhythmic event, especially changes in level of consciousness. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s skin, which may be pale and cool. Signs of fluid retention, such as neck vein distention and crackles and wheezes auscultated in the lungs, may be detected. The rate and rhythm of apical and peripheral pulses are also assessed, and any pulse deficit is noted. The nurse auscultates for extra heart sounds (especially S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub>) and for heart murmurs, measures blood pressure, and determines pulse pressures. A declining pulse pressure indicates reduced cardiac output. One assessment may not disclose significant changes in cardiac output; therefore, the nurse compares multiple assessment findings over time, especially those that occur with and without the arrhythmia.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include eliminating or decreasing the occurrence of the arrhythmia (by decreasing contributory factors) to maintain cardiac output; verbalizing reduction in anxiety; verbalizing an understanding about the arrhythmia, tests used to diagnose the problem, and its treatment; and developing or maintaining self-management skills.</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure, pulse rate and rhythm, rate and depth of respirations, and breath sounds on an ongoing basis to determine the arrhythmia&#x2019;s hemodynamic effect. The nurse also asks the patient about possible symptoms of the arrhythmia (e.g., episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting) as part of the ongoing assessment. If a patient with an arrhythmia is hospitalized, the nurse may obtain a 12-lead ECG, continuously monitor the patient, and analyze rhythm strips to track the arrhythmia.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Control of the occurrence or the effect of the arrhythmia, or both, is often achieved with antiarrhythmic medications. The nurse assesses and observes for the benefits and adverse effects of each medication. The nurse, in collaboration with the primary provider, also manages medication administration carefully so that a constant serum level of the medication is maintained. The nurse may also conduct a 6-minute walk test as prescribed, which is used to identify the patient&#x2019;s ventricular rate in response to exercise. The patient is asked to walk for 6 minutes, covering as much distance as possible (<a href="c22-sec12.xhtml#bib1702">Chen, Chen, Lu, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The nurse monitors the patient for symptoms. At the end, the nurse records the distance covered and the pre- and postexercise heart rate as well as the patient&#x2019;s response.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses for factors that contribute to the arrhythmia (e.g., oxygen deficits, acid&#x2013;base and electrolyte imbalances, caffeine, or nonadherence to the medication regimen). The nurse also monitors for ECG changes (e.g., widening of the QRS, prolongation of the QT interval, increased heart rate) that increase the risk of an arrhythmic event.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<span class="small_c22">EDUCING</span> A<span class="small_c22">NXIETY</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">When the patient experiences episodes of arrhythmia, the nurse stays with the patient and provides assurance of safety and security while maintaining a calm and reassuring attitude. This assists in reducing anxiety (reducing the sympathetic response) and fosters a trusting relationship with the patient. The nurse seeks the patient&#x2019;s view of the events and discusses the emotional response to the arrhythmia, encouraging verbalization of feelings and fears, providing supportive or empathetic statements, and assisting the patient to recognize feelings of anxiety, anger, or sadness. The nurse emphasizes successes with the patient to promote a sense of self-management of the arrhythmia. For example, if a patient is experiencing episodes of arrhythmia and a medication is given that begins to reduce the incidence of the arrhythmia, the nurse communicates that information to the patient and explores the patient&#x2019;s response to this information. In addition, the nurse can help the patient develop a system to identify possible causative, influencing, and alleviating factors (e.g., keeping a diary). The nursing goal is to maximize the patient&#x2019;s control and to make the episode less threatening.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> When educating patients about arrhythmias, the nurse first assesses the patient&#x2019;s understanding, clarifies misinformation, and then shares needed information in terms that are understandable and in a manner that is not frightening or threatening. The nurse clearly explains the etiology of the arrhythmia and treatment options to the patient and family. If necessary, the nurse explains the importance of maintaining therapeutic serum levels of antiarrhythmic medications so that the patient understands why medications should be taken regularly each day and the importance of regular blood testing. If the medication has the potential to alter the heart rate, the patient should be taught how to take their pulse before each dose and to notify the primary provider if the pulse is abnormal. In addition, the relationship between an arrhythmia and cardiac output is explained so that the patient recognizes symptoms of the arrhythmia and the rationale for the treatment regimen. If the patient is prescribed an anticoagulant medication, patient education points about taking anticoagulant medications are summarized in <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, <a href="c26-sec14.xhtml#ct26-10">Chart&#x00A0;26-10</a>. The patient and family need to be educated about measures to take to decrease the risk of recurrence of the arrhythmia. If the patient has a potentially lethal arrhythmia, the nurse establishes with the patient and family a plan of action to take in case of an emergency and, if appropriate, encourages a family member to obtain CPR training.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient and family should also be educated about potential risks of the arrhythmia and their signs and symptoms. For example, the patient with atrial fibrillation should be educated about the possibility of an embolic event.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4">Continuing and Transitional Care. A referral for home, community-based, or transitional care usually is not necessary for the patient with an arrhythmia unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable and has significant symptoms of decreased cardiac output. Home, community-based, or transitional care may be warranted if the patient has significant comorbidities, socioeconomic issues, or limited self-management skills that could increase the risk of nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen. A referral may also be indicated if the patient has had an electronic device implanted recently.</p>
