<h4 class="h4" id="s1532">The Patient in Traction</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;traction:&lt;/b&gt; application of a pulling force to a part of the body">Traction</button></strong> uses a pulling force to promote and maintain alignment to an injured part of the body (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Flynn, 2018</a>). The goals of traction include decreasing muscle spasms and pain, realignment of bone fractures, and correcting or preventing deformities. The type of traction, amount of weight, and whether traction can be removed for nursing care must be determined to obtain its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">At times, traction needs to be applied in more than one direction to achieve the desired line of pull. When this is done, one of the lines of pull counteracts the other. These lines of pull are known as the vectors of force. The actual resultant pulling force is somewhere between the two lines of pull (see <a href="#ff37-10">Fig. 37-10</a>). The effects of traction are evaluated with x-ray studies, and adjustments are made if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Traction is used primarily as a short-term intervention until other modalities, such as external or internal fixation, are possible (AAOS, 2019d). These operative techniques reduce the risk of disuse syndrome and minimize hospital <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1174" title="1174"></span>lengths of stay, often allowing the patient to be cared for in the home setting.</p>

Adjustments in applied forces may be prescribed over the course of treatment.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1533">Principles of Effective Traction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Whenever traction is applied, countertraction must be used to achieve effective results. Countertraction is the force acting in the opposite direction. Usually, the patient&#x2019;s body weight and bed position adjustments supply the needed countertraction.</p>
<p class="indent">When caring for the patient in traction, the nurse should follow these additional principles:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.</span></li>
<li><span>Skeletal traction is <em>never</em> interrupted.</span></li>
<li><span>Weights are not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.</span></li>
<li><span>Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated.</span></li>
<li><span>The patient must be in good body alignment in the center of the bed when traction is applied.</span></li>
<li><span>Ropes must be unobstructed.</span></li>
<li><span>Weights must hang freely and not rest on the bed or floor.</span></li>
<li><span>Knots in the rope or the footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1534">Types of Traction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The use of traction has decreased significantly due to advances in the surgical reduction of fractures, shortened lengths of hospital stay, and research that queries the effectiveness of its use (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2690">Biz, Fantoni, Crepaldi, et al., 2019</a>). However, a basic working knowledge of the use of traction is necessary, because some orthopedic surgeons still prescribe traction for their patients (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Santy-Tomlinson, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are several types of traction. <em>Straight</em> or <em>running traction</em> applies the pulling force in a straight line with the body part resting on the bed. The countertraction is provided by the patient&#x2019;s body and movement can alter the traction provided. Buck&#x2019;s extension traction (discussed later; see Fig.&#x00A0;37-11) is an example of straight traction. <em>Balanced suspension traction</em> (see <a href="#ff37-12">Fig. 37-12</a>) supports the affected extremity off the bed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1175" title="1175"></span>and allows for some patient movement without disruption of the line of pull. With this traction, the countertraction is produced by devices such as slings or splints.</p>

The patient can move vertically as long as the resultant line of pull is maintained. Note the use of overhead trapeze.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Traction may be applied to the skin (<em>skin traction</em>) or directly to the bony skeleton (<em>skeletal traction</em>). The mode of application is determined by the purpose of the traction. Traction can be applied with the hands (<em>manual traction</em>). This is temporary traction that may be used when applying a cast, giving skin care under a Buck&#x2019;s extension foam boot, or adjusting the traction apparatus.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1535">Skin Traction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Skin traction is not frequently used but it may be prescribed as a temporary measure to stabilize a fractured leg, control muscle spasms, and immobilize an area before surgery. The pulling force is applied by weights that are attached to the patient with Velcro, tape, straps, boots, or cuffs (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Duperouzel, Gray, &#x0026; Santy-Tomlinson, 2018</a>). The amount of weight applied must not exceed the tolerance of the skin. No more than 2 to 3.5 kg (4.5 to 8 lb) of traction can be used on an extremity. Pelvic traction is usually limited to 4.5 to 9 kg (10 to 20 lb), depending on the weight of the patient. Buck&#x2019;s extension traction (applied to the lower leg) is the most common type of skin traction indicated for select adults with musculoskeletal injury.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Buck&#x2019;s Extension Traction</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Buck&#x2019;s extension traction (unilateral or bilateral) is skin traction to the lower leg. The pull is exerted in one plane when partial or temporary immobilization is desired (see Fig.&#x00A0;37-11). It is used as a temporary measure to overcome muscle spasms and promote immobilization of hip fractures in adult patients waiting for more definitive treatment such as surgery. However, current data show no direct benefit; that is, there is no improvement in pain and better fracture reduction when Buck&#x2019;s traction is applied preoperatively in patients with hip fractures (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Etxebarria-Foronda &#x0026; Caeiro-Rey, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Before the traction is applied, the nurse inspects the skin for abrasions and circulatory disturbances. The skin and circulation must be in healthy condition to tolerate the traction. The extremity should be clean and dry before the foam boot or traction tape is applied.</p>
<p class="indent">To apply Buck&#x2019;s traction, the extremity is elevated and supported under the patient&#x2019;s heel and knee while the foam boot is placed under the leg, with the patient&#x2019;s heel in the heel of the boot. Next, the Velcro straps are secured around the leg. Traction tape that is overwrapped with an elastic bandage in a spiral fashion may be used instead of the boot. Excessive pressure is avoided over the malleolus and proximal fibula during application to prevent pressure injuries and nerve damage. The rope is then affixed to the spreader or footplate over a pulley fastened to the end of the bed and attaches the prescribed weight&#x2014;usually approximately 2.25 to 3.5 kg (or more precisely 5 to 8 lb)&#x2014;to the rope. The weight should hang freely, not touching parts of the bed or floor as this compromises the efficiency of the traction system (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Duperouzel et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure effective skin traction, it is important to avoid wrinkling and slipping of the traction bandage and to maintain countertraction. Proper positioning must be maintained to keep the leg in a neutral position. To prevent bony fragments from moving against one another, the patient should not turn from side to side; however, the patient may shift position slightly with assistance.</p>
<p class="h7">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse monitors for complications of skin traction, which can include skin breakdown, nerve damage, and circulatory impairment.</p>
<p class="h8">Skin Breakdown</p>
<p class="nonindent">During the initial assessment, the nurse identifies sensitive, fragile skin (common in older adults). The nurse also inspects the skin area that is in contact with tape, foam, or shearing forces, at least every 8 hours, for signs of irritation or inflammation (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Duperouzel et al., 2018</a>). The nurse performs the following procedures to monitor and prevent skin breakdown:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Removes the foam boots to inspect the skin, the ankle, and the Achilles tendon at least twice daily. A second person is needed to support the extremity during the inspection and skin care.</span></li>
<li><span>Palpates the area of the traction tapes daily to detect underlying tenderness.</span></li>
<li><span>Provides frequent repositioning to alleviate pressure and discomfort, because the patient who must remain in a supine position is at increased risk for development of a pressure injury.</span></li>
<li><span>Uses advanced static mattresses or overlays rather than standard hospital foam or alternating-air/low-air-loss mattresses to reduce the risk of pressure injury formation (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Kirman, 2018</a>).</span></li></ul>
<p class="h8">Nerve Damage</p>
<p class="nonindent">Skin traction can place pressure on peripheral nerves. Care must be taken to avoid pressure on the peroneal nerve at the point at which it passes around the neck of the fibula just below the knee when traction is applied to the lower extremity. Pressure at this point can cause footdrop. The nurse regularly questions the patient about sensation and asks the patient to move the toes and foot. The nurse should immediately investigate any complaint of a burning sensation under the traction bandage or boot. Dorsiflexion of the foot demonstrates function of the peroneal nerve. Weakness of dorsiflexion or foot movement and inversion of the foot might indicate pressure on the common peroneal nerve. Plantar flexion demonstrates function of the tibial nerve. In addition, the nurse should promptly report altered sensation or impaired motor function.</p>
<p class="h8">Circulatory Impairment</p>
<p class="nonindent">After skin traction is applied, the nurse assesses circulation of the foot within 15 to 30 minutes and then every 1 to 2 hours. Circulatory assessment consists of:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Peripheral pulses, color, capillary refill, and temperature of the fingers or toes.</span></li>
<li><span>Manifestations of DVT, which include unilateral calf tenderness, warmth, redness, and swelling.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The nurse also encourages the patient to perform active foot exercises every hour when awake.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1175</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1176" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1176">p. 1176</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1536">Skeletal Traction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Skeletal traction is often used when continuous traction is desired to immobilize, position, and align a fracture of the femur, tibia, and cervical spine. It is used when traction is to be maintained for a significant amount of time, when skin traction is not possible, and when greater weight (11 to 18 kg [25 to 40 lb]) is needed to achieve the therapeutic effect. Skeletal traction involves passing a metal pin or wire (e.g., Steinmann pin, Kirschner wire) through the bone (e.g., proximal tibia or distal femur) under local anesthesia, avoiding nerves, blood vessels, muscles, tendons, and joints (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Buckley &#x0026; Page, 2018</a>). Traction is then applied using ropes and weights attached to the end of the pin. Alternatively, skeletal traction may involve the application of tongs to the head that are fixed to the skull to immobilize cervical fractures (see <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The surgeon applies skeletal traction using surgical asepsis. The insertion site is prepared with a surgical scrub agent such as chlorhexidine solution. A local anesthetic agent is given at the insertion site and periosteum. The surgeon makes a small skin incision and drills the sterile pin or wire through the bone. The patient feels pressure during this procedure and possibly some pain when the periosteum is penetrated.</p>
<p class="indent">After insertion, the pin or wire is attached to the traction bow or caliper. The ends of the pin or wire are covered with caps to prevent injury to the patient or caregivers. The weights are attached to the pin or wire bow by a rope and pulley system that exerts the appropriate amount and direction of pull for effective traction (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Biz et al., 2019</a>). The weights applied initially must overcome the shortening spasms of the affected muscles. As the muscles relax, the traction weight is reduced to prevent fracture dislocation and to promote healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Often, skeletal traction is balanced traction, which supports the affected extremity, allows for some patient movement, and facilitates patient independence and nursing care while maintaining effective traction. The Thomas splint with a Pearson attachment is frequently used with skeletal traction for fractures of the femur (see <a href="#ff37-12">Fig. 37-12</a>). Because upward traction is required, an overbed frame is used (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Gray &#x0026; Santy-Tomlinson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When skeletal traction is discontinued, the extremity is gently supported while the weights are removed. The pin is cut close to the skin and removed by the surgeon. Internal fixation, casts, or splints are then used to immobilize and support the healing bone.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When skeletal traction is used, the nurse checks the traction apparatus to see that the ropes are in the wheel grooves of the pulleys, the ropes are not frayed, the weights hang freely, and the knots in the rope are tied securely. The nurse also evaluates the patient&#x2019;s position, making sure that the traction force is always in correct alignment with the leg, with the patient in the mid-line position (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Gray &#x0026; Santy-Tomlinson, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse must never remove weights from skeletal traction unless a life-threatening situation occurs. Removal of the weights defeats their purpose and may result in injury to the patient.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The nurse must maintain alignment of the patient&#x2019;s body in traction as prescribed to promote an effective line of pull (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Gray &#x0026; Santy-Tomlinson, 2018</a>). The nurse positions the patient&#x2019;s foot to avoid footdrop (plantar flexion), inward rotation (inversion), and outward rotation (eversion). The patient&#x2019;s foot may be supported in a neutral position by orthopedic devices (e.g., foot supports).</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient reports severe pain from muscle spasm, the weights may be too heavy, or the patient may need realignment. Pain must be reported to the primary provider if body alignment fails to reduce discomfort. Opioid and nonopioid analgesics may be used to control pain. Muscle relaxants may be prescribed to relieve muscles spasms as needed.</p>
<p class="h7">Preventing Skin Breakdown</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient&#x2019;s elbows frequently become sore, and nerve injury may occur if the patient repositions by pushing on the elbows. In addition, patients frequently push on the heel of the unaffected leg when they raise themselves. This digging of the heel into the mattress may injure the tissues. It is important to instruct patients not to use their heels or elbows to push themselves up in bed (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">El-saidy &#x0026; Aboshehata, 2019</a>). To encourage movement without using the elbows or heel, an assistive device called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;trapeze:&lt;/b&gt; overhead assistive device to promote patient mobility in bed">trapeze</button></strong> can be suspended overhead within easy reach of the patient (see <a href="#ff37-12">Fig. 37-12</a>). The trapeze helps the patient move about in bed and move on and off the bedpan. Transparent film, hydrocolloid dressings, or skin sealants may also be applied to bony prominences (such as elbows) or critical areas to decrease the force of shearing and friction (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2721">Gaspar, Peralta, Marques, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Specific pressure points are assessed for irritation and inflammation at least every 8 hours. Patients at high risk for skin breakdown (e.g., older adults, patients who are malnourished or who have impaired mobility or sensation) may need to be assessed more frequently (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Mervis &#x0026; Phillips, 2019</a>). Areas that are particularly vulnerable to pressure caused by a traction apparatus applied to the lower extremity include the ischial tuberosity, popliteal space, Achilles tendon, and heel. If the patient is not permitted to turn on one side or the other, the nurse must make a special effort to provide back care and to keep the bed dry and free of crumbs and wrinkles. The patient can assist by holding the overhead trapeze and raising the hips off the bed. If the patient cannot do this, the nurse can push down on the mattress with one hand to relieve pressure on the back and bony prominences and to provide for some shifting of weight. Given the supine position that most patients with skeletal traction assume, the use of advanced static mattresses or overlays should be considered rather than foam or alternating-air/low-air-loss mattresses to reduce the risk of pressure injury (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2791">Serraes, Van Leen, Schols, et al., 2018</a>). The patient&#x2019;s heel should be &#x201C;off-loaded&#x201D; and carefully placed on a pillow or heel suspension device to keep the heel from the bed&#x2019;s surface (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Gray &#x0026; Santy-Tomlinson, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For change of bed linens, the patient raises the torso while caregivers on both sides of the bed roll down and replace the upper mattress sheet. Then, as the patient raises the buttocks off the mattress, the sheets are slid under the buttocks. Finally, the lower section of the bed linens is replaced while the patient rests on the back. Sheets and blankets are placed over the patient in such a way that the traction is not disrupted.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1176</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1177" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1177">p. 1177</span></div>
<p class="h7">Monitoring Neurovascular Status</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse evaluates the body part to be placed in traction and compares its neurovascular status (e.g., color, temperature, capillary refill, edema, pulses, ability to move, and sensations) to the unaffected extremity every hour for the first 24 hours after traction is applied and every 4 hours thereafter. The nurse instructs the patient to report any changes in sensation or movement immediately so that they can be promptly evaluated. VTE formation is a significant risk for the patient who is immobilized. The nurse encourages the patient to do active flexion&#x2013;extension ankle exercises and isometric contraction of the calf muscles (calf-pumping exercises) 10 times an hour while awake to decrease venous stasis. In addition, anti-embolism stockings, compression devices, and anticoagulant therapy may be prescribed to help prevent thrombus formation.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse must immediately investigate every report of discomfort expressed by the patient in traction. Prompt recognition of a developing neurovascular problem is essential so that corrective measures can be instituted quickly.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Providing Pin Site Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The wound at the pin insertion site requires attention, and it is important to follow the facility&#x2019;s specific policy pertaining to skeletal pin care. The goal is to avoid infection and development of osteomyelitis (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>). For the first 48&#x00A0;hours after insertion, the site is covered with a sterile absorbent nonstick dressing and a rolled gauze or Ace-type bandage. After this time, a loose cover dressing or no dressing is recommended (a bandage is necessary if the patient is exposed to airborne dust). Expert consensus-based recommendations for pin site care include the following (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Walker, 2018</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Pins located in areas with soft tissue are at greatest risk for infection.</span></li>
<li><span>After the first 48 to 72 hours following skeletal pin placement, pin site care should be performed daily or weekly.</span></li>
<li><span>Chlorhexidine 2 mg/mL solution is the most effective cleansing solution. If chlorhexidine is contraindicated (due to known hypersensitivity or skin reaction), saline solution should be used for cleansing.</span></li>
<li><span>Strict hand hygiene before and after skeletal pin site care should always take place.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The nurse must inspect the pin sites at least every 12 hours for signs of hypersensitivity/allergic reaction (e.g., contact dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema), irritation (e.g., normal changes that occur at the pin site after insertion) and infection. Signs of irritation may include redness, warmth, and serosanguineous drainage at the site, which tend to subside after 72 hours. Signs of infection may mirror those of reaction but also include the presence of purulent drainage, pain, pin loosening, tenting of skin at pin site, odor, and fever. Patient descriptions of their pin sites might be helpful as they are often the first to notice subtle changes in their symptoms and may be able to differentiate between different pin site states (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Santy-Tomlinson, Jomeen, &#x0026; Ersser, 2019</a>). Prophylactic broad-spectrum IV antibiotics may be given for 24 to 48 hours postinsertion to prevent infection; however, the evidence is confounding and there is no general consensus on the advisability of this practice (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2816">Walker, 2018</a>). Minor infections may be readily treated with antibiotics, and infections that result in systemic manifestations may additionally warrant pin removal until the infection resolves.</p>
<p class="indent">Due to a lack of evidence-based research findings, controversy exists about skeletal pin care, showering, and the overall management of pin site crusts, which are the hardened plugs of exudate that adhere to and block the pin sites. Current evidence suggests that crusting at the pin site should be retained as long as the pin site remains uninfected as the retained crusts provides a natural barrier from the external environment, which can prevent bacterial contamination (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2722">Georgiades, 2018</a>). The patient and family should be educated on the performance of any prescribed pin site care prior to discharge from the hospital and should be provided with written follow-up instructions that include the signs and symptoms of infection.</p>
<p class="h7">Promoting Exercise</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patient exercises, within the therapeutic limits of the traction, assist in maintaining muscle strength and tone, and in promoting circulation. Active exercises include pulling up on the trapeze, flexing and extending the feet, and range-of-motion and weight-resistance exercises for noninvolved joints. Isometric exercises of the immobilized extremity (quadriceps and gluteal setting exercises) are important for maintaining strength in major ambulatory muscles (see <a href="c37-sec05.xhtml#ct37-4">Chart 37-4</a>). Without exercise, the patient will lose muscle mass and strength, and rehabilitation will be greatly prolonged.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1537">Nursing Management of the Patient in Traction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of the patient in traction includes assessing for and addressing anxiety, assisting with self-care, and monitoring for complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing Anxiety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse must consider the psychological and physiologic impact of the musculoskeletal problem, traction device, and immobility. Traction restricts mobility and independence. The equipment can look threatening, and its application can be frightening. Confusion, disorientation, and behavioral problems may develop in patients who are confined in a limited space for an extended time. Therefore, the nurse must assess and monitor the patient&#x2019;s anxiety level and psychological responses to traction.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assisting with Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Initially, the patient may require assistance with self-care activities. The nurse helps the patient eat, bathe, dress, and toilet. Convenient arrangement of items such as the telephone, tissues, water, and assistive devices (e.g., reachers, overbed trapeze) may facilitate self-care. With resumption of self-care activities, the patient feels less dependent and less frustrated and experiences improved self-esteem. Because some assistance is required throughout the period of immobility, the nurse and the patient can creatively develop routines that maximize the patient&#x2019;s independence.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1177</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1178" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1178">p. 1178</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immobility-related complications may include pressure injuries (see <a href="c56.xhtml">Chapter 56</a>), atelectasis, pneumonia, constipation, loss of appetite, urinary stasis, urinary tract infections, and VTE formation. Early identification of preexisting or developing conditions facilitates prompt interventions to resolve them.</p>
<p class="h7">Atelectasis and Pneumonia</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse auscultates the patient&#x2019;s lungs every 4 to 8 hours to assess respiratory status and educates the patient about performing deep breathing and coughing exercises to aid in fully expanding the lungs and clearing pulmonary secretions. If the patient history and baseline assessment indicate that the patient is at risk for development of respiratory complications, specific therapies (e.g., the use of an incentive spirometer) may be indicated (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c19-sec02.xhtml#ct19-1">Chart 19-1</a>). If a respiratory complication develops, prompt institution of prescribed therapy is needed.</p>
<p class="h7">Constipation and Anorexia</p>
<p class="nonindent">Reduced gastrointestinal motility results in constipation and anorexia. A diet high in fiber and fluids may help stimulate gastric motility. If constipation develops, therapeutic measures may include stool softeners, laxatives, suppositories, and enemas. To improve the patient&#x2019;s appetite, the patient&#x2019;s food preferences are included, as appropriate, within the prescribed therapeutic diet.</p>
<p class="h7">Urinary Stasis and Infection</p>
<p class="nonindent">Incomplete emptying of the bladder related to positioning in bed can result in urinary stasis and infection. In addition, the patient may find the use of a bedpan uncomfortable and may limit fluids to minimize the frequency of urination. The nurse monitors the fluid intake and the character of the urine. Adequate hydration is important; therefore, the nurse instructs the patient to consume adequate amounts of fluid and to void every 3 to 4 hours. If the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection (e.g., burning or pain on urination, hematuria), the nurse notifies the primary provider.</p>
<p class="h7">Venous Thromboembolism</p>
<p class="nonindent">Venous stasis that predisposes the patient to VTE occurs with immobility. The nurse educates the patient about how to perform ankle and foot exercises within the limits of the traction therapy every 1 to 2 hours when awake to prevent DVT. To increase adherence and promote the family&#x2019;s involvement with the patient&#x2019;s care, it is important to include the family members in any education and care decisions about VTE prevention (<a href="c37-sec11.xhtml#bib2728">Health Services Advisory Group, 2019</a>). The patient is encouraged to drink fluids to prevent dehydration and associated hemoconcentration, which contribute to stasis. The nurse monitors the patient for signs of DVT, including unilateral calf tenderness, warmth, redness, and swelling (increased calf circumference). The nurse promptly reports findings to the primary provider for evaluation and therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">During traction therapy, the nurse encourages the patient to exercise muscles and joints that are not in traction to prevent deterioration, deconditioning, and venous stasis. The physical therapist can design bed exercises that minimize loss of muscle strength. During the patient&#x2019;s exercise, the nurse ensures that traction forces are maintained and that the patient is properly positioned to prevent complications resulting from poor alignment.</p>
