<h4 class="h4" id="s1632">Diverticulum</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An esophageal diverticulum is an out-pouching of mucosa and submucosa that protrudes through a weak portion of the musculature of the esophagus. Diverticula may occur in one of the three areas of the esophagus&#x2014;pharyngoesophageal (upper), midesophageal (middle), or epiphrenic (lower).</p>
<p class="indent">The most common type of diverticulum is Zenker diverticulum (ZD). Located in the pharyngoesophageal area, ZD is caused by a dysfunctional sphincter that fails to open, which leads to increased pressure that forces the mucosa and submucosa to herniate through the esophageal musculature (called a pulsion diverticulum) (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Smith, 2015</a>) (see <a href="#ff39-11">Fig. 39-11</a>). It is usually seen in people older than 60 years of age.</p>
<p class="indent">Midesophageal diverticula are uncommon. Symptoms are less acute, and usually the condition does not require surgery. Epiphrenic diverticula are usually larger diverticula in the lower esophagus just above the diaphragm. They may be related to the improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter or to motor disorders of the esophagus. Intramural diverticulosis is the occurrence of numerous small diverticula associated with a stricture in the upper esophagus.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1633">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms experienced by the patient with a pharyngoesophageal pulsion diverticulum include dysphagia, fullness in the neck, belching, regurgitation of undigested food, and gurgling noises after eating. The diverticulum, or pouch, becomes filled with food or liquid. When the patient assumes a recumbent position, undigested food is regurgitated, and coughing may be caused by irritation of the trachea or aspiration. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;halitosis:&lt;/b&gt; foul odor from the oral cavity; in laypersons&#x2019; terms, &#x201C;bad breath&#x201D;">Halitosis</button></strong> (foul odor from the oral cavity) and a sour taste in the mouth are also common because of the decomposition of food retained in the diverticulum. Although less acute, dysphagia is the primary symptom in the other types of diverticula (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Smith, 2015</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1634">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A barium swallow may determine the exact nature and location of a diverticulum. Manometric studies may be performed for patients with epiphrenic diverticula to rule out a motor disorder. Esophagoscopy usually is contraindicated because of the danger of perforation of the diverticulum, with resulting mediastinitis (inflammation of the organs and tissues that separate the lungs). Blind insertion of an NG tube should be avoided.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1635">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">ZD can be treated by endoscopy (rigid or flexible) or open surgery. Endoscopic septotomy effectively treats ZD, with a recurrence rate of 11% to 30% of cases; POEM may be a better option as it is associated with a decreased risk of symptom recurrence (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2897">Gutierrez, Ichkhanian, Spadaccini, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If surgery is required, care is taken to avoid trauma to the common carotid artery and internal jugular veins. In addition to a diverticulectomy, a myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle is often performed to relieve spasticity of the musculature, which seems to contribute to a continuation of symptoms. An NG tube may be inserted at the time of surgery. Postoperatively, the nurse observes the incision for evidence of leakage from the esophagus and a developing fistula. Food and fluids are withheld until x-ray studies show no leakage at the surgical site. The diet begins with liquids and is progressed as tolerated.</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery is indicated for epiphrenic and midesophageal diverticula only if the symptoms are troublesome and becoming worse. Treatment consists of a diverticulectomy and long myotomy. Intramural diverticula usually regress after the esophageal stricture is dilated.</p>
