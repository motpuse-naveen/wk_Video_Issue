<h4 class="h4" id="s1240">Hodgkin Lymphoma</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively rare malignancy that has a high cure rate. It is somewhat more common in males than in females and has two peaks of incidence: one from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page970" title="970"></span>ages 15 to 34 and the other after 60 years of age (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c). The cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, several risk factors have been identified, which include age, a history of viral infections (particularly the Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus, human immune deficiency virus [HIV], or human herpesvirus 8 [HHV8]), having a family history, and being exposed to cytotoxic agents. Additionally, Hodgkin lymphoma is seen more commonly in patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., organ transplant recipients) and in veterans who were exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange (see Veterans Considerations section in CLL) (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c). The 5-year survival rate for Hodgkin lymphoma is about 92% to 94% for localized/regional disease (stage I or II) and 78% for those with distant disease (stage IV) (ACS, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1241">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Unlike other lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma is unicentric in origin, meaning that it initiates in a single node. The disease spreads by contiguous extension along the lymphatic system. The malignant cell of Hodgkin lymphoma is the Reed&#x2013;Sternberg cell, a gigantic tumor cell that is morphologically unique and thought to be of immature lymphoid origin. These cells arise from the B lymphocyte. They may have more than one nucleus and often have an owl-like appearance (see <a href="#ff30-7">Fig. 30-7</a>). The presence of Reed&#x2013;Sternberg cells is the pathologic hallmark and essential diagnostic criterion.</p>
<p class="indent">The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified Hodgkin lymphoma into five subtypes based on pathologic analyses that reflect the natural history of the disease and suggest the prognosis (NCCN, 2019g). Four of these subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma are recognized as being consistent with classical disease (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2217">Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c; Spinner, Varma, &#x0026; Advani, 2018</a>):</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Nodular sclerosis</em>: This is the most common form of Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for about 70% of all cases. It is seen most often in the young; among these patients, the lymph node contains elements of fibrous (sclerotic) tissue; approximately 40% of patients have B symptoms (see <strong><a href="c30-sec06.xhtml#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a></strong>). This type of Hodgkin lymphoma is highly curable.</p>

<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Mixed cellularity</em>: This is the second most common form of Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for 20% to 25% of all cases. This subtype is more common in older adults and in males; it is frequently seen in patients with HIV infection, and B symptoms are frequently reported.</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Lymphocyte-depleted:</em> This form of Hodgkin lymphoma is rare; it is characterized by involved lymph node(s) with few normal lymphocytes but numerous Reed&#x2013;Sternberg cells. B symptoms are commonly reported.</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Lymphocyte-rich</em>: This type of Hodgkin lymphoma is also an uncommon form of the disease; the lymph node(s) has numerous normal lymphocytes and Reed&#x2013;Sternberg cells and B symptoms are rare.</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><em>Nodular lymphocytes predominant Hodgkin lymphoma</em> (NLPHL): This is the lone type of Hodgkin lymphoma that is not considered of the classical type. In NLPHL there are few Reed&#x2013;Sternberg cells; rather, there is a predominance of lymphocyte cells called &#x201C;popcorn&#x201D; cells. Furthermore, there is minimal involvement of the lymph nodes as compared to the subtypes that fall under the four classical Hodgkin types. NLPHL is seen more often in males than females and the age at diagnosis is more often between 30 and 50 years. Patients tend to present with peripheral adenopathy and with early-stage disease. NLPHL is slow growing and highly curable, but some patients can relapse while others can transform to an aggressive NHL (see later discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1242">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hodgkin lymphoma usually begins as an enlargement of one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck. The individual nodes are painless and firm but not hard. The most common sites for lymphadenopathy are the cervical nodes. However, other nodes that can be affected include the supraclavicular and mediastinal nodes; involvement of the iliac or inguinal nodes or spleen is much less common (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c). A mediastinal mass may be seen on chest x-ray; occasionally, the mass is large enough to compress the trachea and cause dyspnea. B symptoms, if present, are indicative of more advanced disease (see <strong><a href="c30-sec06.xhtml#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a></strong>). These symptoms are found in about 40% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and are used in determining stage and prognosis (NCCN, 2019g).</p>
<p class="indent">All organs are vulnerable to invasion by tumor cells. Clinical manifestations result from compression of organs by the tumor, such as cough and pulmonary effusion (from pulmonary infiltrates), jaundice (from hepatic involvement or bile duct obstruction), abdominal pain (from splenomegaly or retroperitoneal adenopathy), or bone pain (from skeletal involvement). A mild anemia is the most common hematologic finding. The leukocyte count may be elevated or decreased. The platelet count is typically normal, unless the tumor has invaded the bone marrow, suppressing hematopoiesis. Laboratory tests that may be assessed to detect disease activity include the serum copper level, which may be elevated, and the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR):&lt;/b&gt; laboratory test that measures the rate of settling of red blood cells (RBCs); elevation is indicative of inflammation; also called the &lt;em&gt;sed rate&lt;/em&gt;">erythrocyte sedimentation rate</button></strong> (ESR). The ESR measures the rate of settling of RBCs; elevation is indicative of inflammation; it is also called the <em>sed rate.</em></p>

<p class="indent">Other symptoms seen in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are pruritus, which is common and can be extremely distressing, fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, splenomegaly, and although rare, occasional pain in affected lymph node after drinking alcohol (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c). Patients may also have impaired cellular immunity, as evidenced by an absent or decreased reaction to skin sensitivity tests (i.e., Candida, mumps) and increased susceptibility to infections, particularly herpes zoster (see <a href="#ff30-8">Fig. 30-8</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1243">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because many manifestations are similar to those occurring with infection, diagnostic studies are performed to rule out an infectious origin of the disease. The diagnosis is made by means of an excisional lymph node biopsy and the presence of Reed&#x2013;Sternberg cells. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and the histologic type is established, it is necessary to assess the stage of the disease.</p>
<p class="indent">During the health history, the patient is assessed for any B symptoms (see <strong><a href="c30-sec06.xhtml#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a></strong>). Physical examination requires a careful, systematic evaluation of all palpable lymph node chains (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>, <a href="c28-sec03.xhtml#ff28-4">Fig. 28-4</a>), as well as the size of the spleen and liver. A chest x-ray and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are crucial to identify the extent of lymphadenopathy within these regions. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is the most sensitive imaging test and is recommended for initial staging to help determine the extent of disease as well as later for evaluation of response to treatment (NCCN, 2019g). Laboratory tests include CBC with differential; serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine; ESR; liver and renal function studies; immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic evaluation; HIV testing; and hepatitis B and C testing. A multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan and/or ECG should be performed prior to the start of therapy if the patient is to receive an anthracycline-based treatment regimen, as these chemotherapeutic agents are associated with adverse cardiovascular effects. Bone marrow biopsies are not routinely performed unless cytopenias are present and the PET scan is negative (NCCN, 2019g).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1244">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma is cure, as the overall cure rate is about 90% (ACS, 2019a). Treatment is determined primarily by stage of disease, not histologic type, utilizing the Ann Arbor staging system (see <a href="#ff30-9">Fig. 30-9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment guidelines for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (NCCN, 2019g) divide patients into groups. Patients with early disease (stage I-II) may receive one of the following combination chemotherapy regimens: ABVD (doxorubicin [trade name <strong><em>A</em></strong>driamycin], <strong><em>b</em></strong>leomycin, <strong><em>v</em></strong>inblastine, and <strong><em>d</em></strong>acarbazine) or Stanford V (doxorubicin, vinblastine, mechlorethamine, etoposide, vincristine, bleomycin, and prednisone) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page972" title="972"></span>(see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#tt12-7">Table 12-7</a>, for further discussion of specific categories of chemotherapeutic/antineoplastic agents). Radiation therapy may or may not be included as part of the treatment regimen.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff30-9">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff30-9.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff30-9.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;30-9 &#x2022;</span> Stages of Hodgkin lymphoma based upon the Ann Arbor staging system. Each category is subdivided and assigned to one of the following categories: Category A indicates no symptoms are present. Category B indicates the presence of B symptoms (see <a href="c30-sec06.xhtml#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a>). Category E indicates involvement of organs or tissues beyond the lymphatic system. Category S indicates involvement of the spleen. Image used with permission of The Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society (Hodgkin Lymphoma, 2020).</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The standard treatment for patients with advanced disease (stages III to IV) and those with B symptoms is also ABVD chemotherapy, although these patients typically receive additional cycles of chemotherapy treatment. Other combinations of chemotherapy may be used; however, these options have more toxic effects.</p>
<p class="indent">When a patient has a suspected relapse of disease, a biopsy and a PET scan are performed to confirm the diagnosis and stage of disease. Treatment options for patients with refractory or relapsed disease include immunotherapeutic agents, such as a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (e.g., everolimus, brentuximab), or a checkpoint inhibitor (e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab) (see discussion of MoAbs and checkpoint inhibitors in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c; NCCN, 2019g).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment for patients with NLPHL in the early stage of disease may include radiation therapy only. In a few instances (patients who are stage IA), observation rather than any therapy may be an option (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2241">Spinner et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Patients with stage IB to IIB disease may receive ABVD, CHOP (<strong><em>c</em></strong>yclophosphamide, doxorubicin [also less commonly called <strong><em>h</em></strong>ydroxydaunorubicin], vincristine [trade name of <strong><em>O</em></strong>ncovin], and <strong><em>p</em></strong>rednisone), or CVP (<strong><em>c</em></strong>yclophosphamide, <strong><em>v</em></strong>incristine, and <strong><em>p</em></strong>rednisone) regimens in combination with rituximab. Those with advanced stage disease are treated with these same regimens but with radiation therapy added.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients typically feel better following therapy. Late effects of treatment, which may occur months to years following treatment, include development of a secondary malignancy, or cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism, and infertility (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c; NCCN, 2019g). Secondary malignancies (most common are lung and breast) often develop more than 10 years following completion of therapy. This is especially true in females who received radiation therapy to the chest or axillary areas (NCCN, 2019g).</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy) is also seen 10 years posttreatment and tends to occur in patients who received mediastinal radiation or an anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., daunorubicin, doxorubicin). Hypothyroidism may occur in about 50% of long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in those who received neck or upper mediastinal radiation (NCCN, 2019g). The use of some chemotherapy combinations can lead to infertility in both males and females. For instance, females of childbearing years may experience premature menopause following treatment with alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine). Other organ dysfunction is also well documented, including that of the endocrine system. Persistent fatigue is common in survivors and can be exacerbated by depression and other treatment-related comorbidities (ACS, 2019a; Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018c; NCCN, 2019g). Potential long-term complications associated with chemotherapy are listed in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#ct12-4">Chart 12-4</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1245">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The potential development of a second malignancy should be addressed with the patient when initial treatment decisions are made. However, patients need to be informed that Hodgkin lymphoma is often curable. The nurse should encourage patients to reduce factors that increase the risk of developing second cancers, such as use of tobacco and alcohol and exposure to environmental carcinogens and excessive sunlight. Screening for late effects of treatment, such as chemotherapy (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec06.xhtml#ct12-4">Chart 12-4</a>), is necessary. In addition, the nurse should provide education about relevant self-care strategies and disease management. See also the Nursing Management Section for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.</p>
