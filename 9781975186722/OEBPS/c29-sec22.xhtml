<h4 class="h4" id="s1191">Activated Protein C Resistance and Factor V Leiden Mutation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">APC resistance is a common condition that can occur with other hypercoagulable states. APC is an anticoagulant, and resistance to APC increases risk for venous thrombosis. A defect in the factor V gene has been identified in 90% of patients with APC resistance. This factor V Leiden mutation is the most common cause of inherited hypercoagulability in Caucasians; its incidence appears to be much lower in other ethnic groups (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Bunn &#x0026; Bauer, 2017</a>; <a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Middeldorp &#x0026; Coppens, 2016</a>). The risk of thrombosis significantly increases when factor V Leiden mutation is paired with other risk factors (e.g., increased age, use of oral contraceptives, hyperhomocysteinemia). People who are homozygous for factor V Leiden mutation are at extreme risk for thrombosis and therefore require lifelong anticoagulation. In contrast, those who are heterozygous for the mutation have a lower risk for developing a thrombus. The duration of anticoagulation is based on the coexistence of other risk factors for thrombus formation.</p>
