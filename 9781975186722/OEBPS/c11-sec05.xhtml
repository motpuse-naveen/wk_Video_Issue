<h4 class="h4" id="s345">Cardiogenic Shock</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardiogenic shock:&lt;/b&gt; shock state resulting from impairment or failure of the myocardium">Cardiogenic shock</button></strong> occurs when the heart&#x2019;s ability to contract and to pump blood is impaired and the supply of oxygen is inadequate for the heart and the tissues. The causes of cardiogenic shock are known as either coronary or noncoronary. Coronary cardiogenic shock is more common than noncoronary cardiogenic shock and is seen most often in patients with acute MI resulting in damage to a significant portion of the left ventricular myocardium (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Wilcox, 2019</a>). Patients who experience an anterior wall MI are at greatest risk for cardiogenic shock because of the potentially extensive damage to the left ventricle caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Noncoronary causes of cardiogenic shock are related to conditions that stress the myocardium (e.g., severe hypoxemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, tension pneumothorax) as well as conditions that result in ineffective myocardial function (e.g., cardiomyopathies, valvular damage, cardiac tamponade, arrhythmias).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s346">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In cardiogenic shock, cardiac output, which is a function of both stroke volume and heart rate, is compromised. When stroke volume and heart rate decrease or become erratic, BP falls and tissue perfusion is reduced. Blood supply for tissues and organs and for the heart muscle itself is inadequate, resulting in impaired tissue perfusion. Because impaired tissue perfusion weakens the heart and impairs its ability to pump, the ventricle does not fully eject its volume of blood during systole. As a result, fluid accumulates in the lungs. This sequence of events can occur rapidly or over a period of days (<a href="#ff11-5">Fig.&#x00A0;11-5</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s347">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients in cardiogenic shock may experience the pain of angina, develop arrhythmias, complain of fatigue, express feelings of doom, and show signs of hemodynamic instability.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s348">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">To assess the degree of myocardial damage, laboratory biomarkers for ventricular dysfunction (e.g., B-type natriuretic peptide), cardiac enzyme levels and biomarkers (cTn-I), and serum lactate are measured. In addition, a transthoracic echocardiography may be performed at the bedside, and serial 12-lead electrocardiograms are obtained (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bellumkonda, Gul, &#x0026; Masri, 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Wilcox, 2019</a>). Continuous ECG and ST segment monitoring is also done to closely monitor the patient for ischemic changes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s349"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of medical management in cardiogenic shock are to limit further myocardial damage and preserve the healthy myocardium and to improve cardiac function by increasing cardiac contractility, decreasing ventricular afterload, or both (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Wilcox, 2019</a>). In general, these goals are achieved by increasing oxygen supply to the heart muscle while reducing oxygen demands.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Correction of Underlying Causes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As with all forms of shock, the underlying cause of cardiogenic shock must be corrected. It is necessary first to treat the oxygenation needs of the heart muscle to ensure its continued ability to pump blood to other organs. In the case of coronary cardiogenic shock (e.g., acute coronary syndromes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, nonischemic cardiomyopathies, and myocarditis), the patient may require thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy, a percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, IABP therapy, ventricular assist device, or some combination of these treatments (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bellumkonda et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Wilcox, 2019</a>). In the case of noncoronary cardiogenic shock, interventions focus on correcting the underlying cause, such as replacement of an impaired cardiac valve, correction of an arrhythmia, correction of acidosis and electrolyte disturbances, or treatment of a tension pneumothorax. If the cause of the cardiogenic shock was related to a cardiac arrest, once the patient is successfully resuscitated, targeted temperature management, also called <em>therapeutic hypothermia,</em> may be initiated to actively lower the body temperature to a targeted core temperature (e.g., 32&#x00B0;C [89.6&#x00B0;F] to 36&#x00B0;C [96.8&#x00B0;F]) to preserve neurologic function (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib843">American Heart Association, 2018</a>). (See <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for more information regarding MI.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Initiation of First-Line Treatment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment priorities for patients in cardiogenic shock are focused upon ensuring adequate oxygenation, pain control, and maintaining hemodynamic stability.</p>
<p class="h7">Oxygenation</p>
<p class="nonindent">In the early stages of shock, if the patient&#x2019;s oxygen saturation is less than 90%, supplemental oxygen is given by nasal cannula at a rate of 2 to 6 L/min (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Neto, 2018</a>). Monitoring of arterial blood gas values, pulse oximetry values, and ventilatory effort (i.e., work of breathing) helps determine whether the patient requires a more aggressive method of oxygen delivery (including noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation).</p>
<p class="h7">Pain Control</p>
<p class="nonindent">If a patient experiences chest pain, IV morphine may be given for pain relief. In addition to relieving pain, morphine may dilate the blood vessels, reducing the workload of the heart by both decreasing the cardiac filling pressure (preload) and reducing the pressure against which the heart muscle has to eject blood (afterload). However, recent evidence suggests morphine may adversely affect antiplatelet agents used to treat the ischemic event; thus, the benefits of morphine may not outweigh its risks (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib891">McCarthy, Bhambhani, Pomerantsev, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Neto, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hemodynamic Monitoring</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hemodynamic monitoring is initiated to assess the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. In many institutions, this is performed in the intensive care unit (ICU), where an arterial line can be inserted. The arterial line enables accurate and continuous monitoring of BP and provides a port from which to obtain frequent arterial blood samples without having to perform repeated arterial punctures. A multilumen CVP and PA catheter may be inserted to allow measurement of myocardial filling pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, cardiac output, and pulmonary and systemic resistance. (For more information, see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>.)</p>
<p class="h7">Fluid Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Appropriate fluid administration is also necessary in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. Administration of fluids must be monitored closely to detect signs of fluid overload. Incremental IV fluid boluses are cautiously given to determine optimal filling pressures for improving cardiac output.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>A fluid bolus should never be given rapidly, because rapid fluid administration in patients with cardiac failure may result in acute pulmonary edema.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Pharmacologic Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Vasoactive medication therapy consists of multiple pharmacologic strategies to restore and maintain adequate cardiac output. In coronary cardiogenic shock, the aims of vasoactive medication therapy are improved cardiac contractility, decreased preload and afterload, and stabilized heart rate and rhythm.</p>
<p class="indent">Because improving contractility and decreasing cardiac workload are opposing pharmacologic actions, two types of medications may be given in combination: inotropic agents and vasodilators. Inotropic medications increase cardiac output by mimicking the action of the sympathetic nervous system, activating myocardial receptors to increase myocardial contractility (inotropic action), or increasing the heart rate (chronotropic action). These agents may also enhance vascular tone, increasing preload. Vasodilators are used primarily to decrease afterload, reducing the workload of the heart and oxygen demand. Vasodilators also decrease preload. Medications commonly combined to treat cardiogenic shock include dobutamine, nitroglycerin, and dopamine (see <a href="c11-sec03.xhtml#tt11-2">Table&#x00A0;11-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Dobutamine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dobutamine produces inotropic effects by stimulating myocardial beta-receptors, increasing the strength of myocardial activity and improving cardiac output. Myocardial alpha-adrenergic receptors are also stimulated, resulting in decreased pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance (decreased afterload) (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Maclaren et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 288</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page289" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="289">p. 289</span></div>
<p class="h8">Nitroglycerin</p>
<p class="nonindent">IV nitroglycerin in low doses acts as a venous vasodilator and therefore reduces preload. At higher doses, nitroglycerin causes arterial vasodilation and therefore reduces afterload as well. These actions, in combination with dobutamine, increase cardiac output while minimizing cardiac workload. In addition, vasodilation enhances blood flow to the myocardium, improving oxygen delivery to the weakened heart muscle (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Maclaren et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Wilcox, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Dopamine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dopamine is a sympathomimetic agent that has varying vasoactive effects depending on the dosage. It may be used with dobutamine and nitroglycerin to improve tissue perfusion. Doses of 2 to 8 &#x03BC;g/kg/min improve contractility (inotropic action), slightly increase the heart rate (chronotropic action), and may increase cardiac output. Doses that are higher than 8 &#x03BC;g/kg/min predominantly cause vasoconstriction, which increases afterload and thus increases cardiac workload. Because this effect is undesirable in patients with cardiogenic shock, dopamine doses must be carefully titrated.</p>
<p class="indent">In severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs in the later stages of shock, metabolic acidosis must first be corrected to ensure maximum effectiveness of vasoactive medications (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Maclaren et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Other Vasoactive Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Additional vasoactive agents that may be used in managing cardiogenic shock include norepinephrine, epinephrine, milrinone, vasopressin, phenylephrine, and angiotensin II. Each of these medications stimulates different receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. A combination of these medications may be prescribed, depending on the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. All vasoactive medications have adverse effects, making specific medications more useful than others at different stages of shock (see <a href="c11-sec03.xhtml#tt11-2">Table&#x00A0;11-2</a>). Diuretics such as furosemide may be given to reduce the workload of the heart by reducing fluid accumulation.</p>
<p class="h8">Antiarrhythmic Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Multiple factors, such as hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalances, and acid&#x2013;base imbalances, contribute to serious cardiac arrhythmias in all patients with shock. In addition, as a compensatory response to decreased cardiac output and BP, the heart rate increases beyond normal limits. This impedes cardiac output further by shortening diastole and thereby decreasing the time for ventricular filling. Consequently, antiarrhythmic medications are required to stabilize the heart rate. General principles regarding the administration of vasoactive medications are discussed later in this chapter. (For a full discussion of cardiac arrhythmias as well as commonly prescribed medications, see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>.)</p>
<p class="h7">Mechanical Assistive Devices</p>
<p class="nonindent">If cardiac output does not improve despite supplemental oxygen, vasoactive medications, and fluid boluses, mechanical assistive devices are used temporarily to improve the heart&#x2019;s ability to pump. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation with an IABP is one means of providing temporary circulatory assistance (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Hochman &#x0026; Reyentovich, 2019</a>). The IABP is a catheter with an inflatable balloon at the end. The catheter is usually inserted through the femoral artery and threaded toward the heart, and the balloon is positioned in the descending thoracic aorta (<a href="#ff11-6">Fig.&#x00A0;11-6</a>). The IABP uses internal counterpulsation through the regular inflation and deflation of the balloon to augment the pumping action of the heart. It inflates during diastole, increasing the pressure in the aorta during diastole and therefore increasing blood flow through the coronary and peripheral arteries. It deflates just before systole, lessening the pressure within the aorta before left ventricular contraction, decreasing the amount of resistance the heart has to overcome to eject blood and therefore decreasing left ventricular workload. The device is connected to a console that synchronizes the inflation and deflation of the balloon with the ECG or the arterial pressure (as indicators for systole and diastole). Hemodynamic monitoring is often used to determine the patient&#x2019;s response to the IABP. The IABP provides short-term (days) support for the failing myocardium.</p>

It deflates just before systole, which results in a decrease in afterload (resistance to ejection) and in the left ventricular workload.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Other means of mechanical assistance include left and right ventricular assist devices and total temporary artificial hearts (see <a href="c24.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;24</a> and <a href="c25.xhtml">25</a>). Another short-term means of providing cardiac or pulmonary support to the patient in cardiogenic shock is through an extracorporeal device similar to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system used in open-heart surgery (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). CPB is used only in emergency situations until definitive treatment, such as heart transplantation, can be initiated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s350"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The role of the nurse managing the care of a patient with cardiogenic shock revolves around preventing its serious complications, monitoring hemodynamics, administering medications and fluids, maintaining intra-aortic counterpulsation as indicated, and promoting safety and comfort.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 289</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page290" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="290">p. 290</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Cardiogenic Shock</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Identifying at-risk patients early, promoting adequate oxygenation of the heart muscle, and decreasing cardiac workload can prevent cardiogenic shock. This can be accomplished by conserving the patient&#x2019;s energy, promptly relieving angina, and administering supplemental oxygen. Often, however, cardiogenic shock cannot be prevented. In such instances, nursing management includes working with other members of the health care team to prevent shock from progressing and to restore adequate cardiac function and tissue perfusion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Hemodynamic Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A major role of the nurse is monitoring the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic and cardiac status. Arterial lines and ECG monitoring equipment must be well maintained and functioning properly. The nurse anticipates the medications, IV fluids, and equipment that might be used and is ready to assist in implementing these measures. Changes in hemodynamic, cardiac, and pulmonary status and laboratory values are documented and reported promptly. In addition, adventitious breath sounds, changes in cardiac rhythm, and other abnormal physical assessment findings are reported immediately.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Administering Medications and Intravenous Fluids</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse plays a critical role in the safe and accurate administration of IV fluids and medications. Fluid overload and pulmonary edema are risks because of ineffective cardiac function and accumulation of blood and fluid in the pulmonary tissues. The nurse documents medications and treatments that are given as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must be knowledgeable about the desired effects as well as the side effects of medications. For example, the nurse monitors the patient for decreased BP after administering morphine or nitroglycerin. Arterial and venous puncture sites must be observed for bleeding, and pressure must be applied at the sites if bleeding occurs. IV infusions must be observed closely because tissue necrosis and sloughing may occur if vasopressor medications infiltrate the tissues. When possible, vasoactive medications should be given using central IV lines (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bauer et al., 2019</a>). Furthermore, the need for the central IV access devices should be reviewed daily to reduce the risk of CLABSIs (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib890">Marschall, Mermel, Fakih, et al., 2014</a>). The nurse must also monitor urine output, serum electrolytes, BUN, and serum creatinine levels to detect decreased renal function secondary to the effects of cardiogenic shock or its treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Intra-Aortic Balloon Counterpulsation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse plays a critical role in caring for the patient receiving intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. The nurse makes ongoing timing adjustments of the balloon pump to maximize its effectiveness by synchronizing it with the cardiac cycle. The patient is at risk for circulatory compromise to the leg on the side where the catheter for the balloon has been inserted; therefore, the nurse must check the neurovascular status of the lower extremities frequently.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Enhancing Safety and Comfort</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse must take an active role in safeguarding the patient, enhancing comfort, and reducing anxiety. This includes administering medication to relieve chest pain, preventing infection at the multiple arterial and venous line insertion sites, protecting the skin, and monitoring respiratory and renal function. Proper positioning of the patient promotes effective breathing without decreasing BP and may also increase patient comfort while reducing anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">Brief explanations about procedures that are being performed and the use of comforting touch often provide reassurance to the patient and the family. The family is usually anxious and benefits from opportunities to see and talk to the patient. Explanations of treatments and the patient&#x2019;s responses are often comforting to family members.</p>
<p class="indent">Family presence during a patient&#x2019;s critical illness has been a concern for family members, patients, nurses and other health care providers. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have outlined several elements that may enhance and support the patient and family experience during critical illness. Davidson and colleagues (2017) identified the importance of frequent, clear communication, an environment which encourages comfortable visitation, flexible visitation policies, including the option for family to stay overnight, and patient and family engagement in clinical decisions as mechanisms to enhance family support. A qualitative research study conducted by Wong and colleagues (2020) explored family perspectives of participation in patient care in the adult ICU. The nurse researchers interviewed and observed 30 family members. Findings demonstrated that families&#x2019; perceptions of their contribution to the patient&#x2019;s psychosocial and emotional well-being were influenced by their engagement in care. See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="c11-sec06.xhtml#ct11-4">Chart&#x00A0;11-4</a>.</p>
