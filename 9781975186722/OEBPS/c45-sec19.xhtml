<h4 class="h4" id="s1980">Hyperparathyroidism</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperparathyroidism is caused by overproduction of parathormone by the parathyroid glands and is characterized by bone decalcification and the development of renal calculi (kidney stones) containing calcium.</p>
<p class="indent">Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs two to four times more often in women than in men and is most common in people between 60 and 70 years of age. Its incidence is approximately 25 cases per 100,000 people. The disorder is rare in children younger than 15 years, but its incidence increases 10-fold between the ages of 15 and 65 years. Half of the people diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism do not have symptoms (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Yalla &#x0026; Hickey, 2019</a>). Secondary hyperparathyroidism, with manifestations similar to those of primary hyperparathyroidism, occurs in patients who have chronic kidney failure and the so-called renal rickets as a result of phosphorus retention, increased stimulation of the parathyroid glands, and increased parathormone secretion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1981">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms resulting from involvement of several body systems. Apathy, fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias may occur. All of these signs and symptoms are attributable to the increased concentration of calcium in the blood. Psychological effects may vary from irritability and neurosis to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1471" title="1471"></span>psychoses caused by the direct action of calcium on the brain and nervous system. An increase in calcium produces a decrease in the excitation potential of nerve and muscle tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">Nephrolithiasis (formation of stones in one or both kidneys), related to the increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus, is one of the major complications of hyperparathyroidism. Although the incidence is on the decline in the United States, nephrolithiasis occurs in 15% to 20% of newly diagnosed patients (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Yalla &#x0026; Hickey, 2019</a>). Kidney damage can result from the precipitation of calcium phosphate in the renal pelvis and parenchyma, which causes renal calculi, obstruction, pyelonephritis, and kidney injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Musculoskeletal symptoms accompanying hyperparathyroidism may be caused by demineralization of the bones or by bone tumors composed of benign giant cells resulting from overgrowth of osteoclasts. The patient may develop skeletal pain and tenderness, especially of the back and joints; pain on weight bearing; pathologic fractures; deformities; and shortening of body stature. Bone loss attributable to hyperparathyroidism increases the risk of fracture.</p>
<p class="indent">The incidence of peptic ulcer and pancreatitis is increased with hyperparathyroidism and may be responsible for many of the GI symptoms that occur.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1982">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed by persistent elevation of serum calcium levels and an elevated concentration of parathormone. Radioimmunoassays for parathormone are sensitive and differentiate primary hyperparathyroidism from other causes of hypercalcemia in more than 80% of patients with elevated serum calcium levels (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Silverberg &#x0026; Fuleihan, 2019</a>). An elevated serum calcium level alone is a nonspecific finding, because serum levels may be altered by diet, medications, and kidney and bone changes. Bone changes may be detected on x-ray or bone scans in advanced disease. The double-antibody parathyroid hormone test is used to distinguish between primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy as a cause of hypercalcemia. Ultrasound, MRI, thallium scan, and fine-needle biopsy have been used to evaluate the function of the parathyroid glands and to localize parathyroid cysts, adenomas, or hyperplasia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1983">Medical Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The recommended treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy, the surgical removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Silverberg &#x0026; Fuleihan, 2019</a>). In the past, the standard parathyroidectomy involved a bilateral neck exploration under general anesthesia. Today, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy techniques allow for unilateral neck exploration using local anesthesia; these are performed on an outpatient basis. In some cases, only the removal of a single diseased gland is necessary, reducing morbidity rates associated with surgery. For asymptomatic patients who have only mildly elevated serum calcium concentrations and normal kidney function, surgery may be delayed and the patient monitored closely for worsening of hypercalcemia, bone deterioration, renal impairment, or the development of kidney stones.</p>
<p class="indent">Surgery is recommended for patients who are asymptomatic and who meet one or more of the following criteria: younger than 50 years; unable or unlikely to participate in follow-up care; serum calcium level more than 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) above normal reference range; GFR less than 60 mL/min; urinary calcium level greater than 400 mg per day (10 mmol per day); bone density at hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius with T score less than &#x2013;2.5 or previous fracture at any site; or nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Yalla &#x0026; Hickey, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hydration Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with hyperparathyroidism are at risk for renal calculi. Therefore, a daily fluid intake of 2000 mL or more is encouraged to help prevent calculus formation. The patient is instructed to report other manifestations of renal calculi, such as abdominal pain and hematuria. Thiazide diuretics are avoided, because they decrease the renal excretion of calcium and further elevate serum calcium levels. Because of the risk of hypercalcemic crisis (see later discussion), the patient is instructed to avoid dehydration and to seek immediate health care if conditions that commonly produce dehydration (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea) occur.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mobility</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse encourages the patient to be mobile. The patient with limited mobility is encouraged to walk. Bones subjected to the normal stress of walking give up less calcium. Bed rest increases calcium excretion and the risk of renal calculi. Oral phosphates lower the serum calcium level in some patients; long-term use is not recommended because of the risk of ectopic calcium phosphate deposition in soft tissues.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Diet and Medications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nutritional needs are met, but the patient is advised to avoid a diet with restricted or excess calcium. If the patient has a coexisting peptic ulcer, prescribed antacids and protein feedings are necessary. Because anorexia is common, efforts are made to improve the appetite. Prune juice, stool softeners, and physical activity, along with increased fluid intake, help offset constipation, which is common postoperatively.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1984">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The insidious onset and chronic nature of hyperparathyroidism along with its diverse and commonly vague symptoms may result in depression and frustration. The family may have considered the patient&#x2019;s illness to be psychosomatic. An awareness of the course of the disorder and an understanding approach by the nurse may help the patient and family deal with their reactions and feelings.</p>
<p class="indent">The nursing management of the patient undergoing parathyroidectomy is essentially the same as that of a patient undergoing thyroidectomy. However, the previously described precautions about airway patency, dehydration, immobility, and diet are particularly important in the patient who is awaiting or recovering from parathyroidectomy. Although not all parathyroid tissue is removed during surgery in an effort to control the calcium&#x2013;phosphorus balance, the nurse closely monitors the patient to detect symptoms of tetany (which may be an early postoperative complication). Most patients quickly regain function of the remaining parathyroid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1472" title="1472"></span>tissue and experience only mild, transient postoperative hypocalcemia. In patients with significant bone disease or bone changes, a more prolonged period of hypocalcemia should be anticipated. The nurse educates the patient and family about the importance of follow-up laboratory testing to ensure return of serum calcium levels to normal (see <a href="#ct45-9">Chart 45-9</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1985"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Complications: Hypercalcemic Crisis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute hypercalcemic crisis can occur with extreme elevation of serum calcium levels. Serum calcium levels greater than 13 mg/dL (3.25 mmol/L) result in neurologic, cardiovascular, and kidney symptoms that can be life-threatening (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Rapid rehydration with large volumes of IV isotonic saline fluids to maintain urine output of 100 to 150 mL per hour is combined with administration of calcitonin (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>). Calcitonin promotes renal excretion of excess calcium and reduces bone resorption. The saline infusion should be stopped and a loop diuretic may be needed if the patient develops edema. Dosage and rates of infusion depend on the patient profile. The patient should be monitored carefully for fluid overload. Loop diuretics are not recommended as initial therapy in the absence of heart failure and kidney insufficiency. Bisphosphonates are added to promote a sustained decrease in serum calcium levels by promoting calcium deposition in bone and reducing the GI absorption of calcium. Cytotoxic agents (e.g., mithramycin), calcitonin, and dialysis may be used in emergency situations to decrease serum calcium levels quickly.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The patient in acute hypercalcemic crisis requires close monitoring for life-threatening complications (e.g., airway obstruction) and prompt treatment to reduce serum calcium levels.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">A combination of calcitonin and corticosteroids is given in emergencies to reduce the serum calcium level by increasing calcium deposition in bone. Other agents that may be given to decrease serum calcium levels include bisphosphonates (e.g., etidronate, pamidronate) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Shane &#x0026; Berenson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Expert assessment and care are required to minimize complications and reverse the life-threatening hypercalcemia. Medications are given with care, and attention is given to fluid balance to promote return of normal fluid and electrolyte balance. Supportive measures are necessary for the patient and family. See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#tt12-13">Table 12-13</a>, for further discussion of hypercalcemic crisis.</p>
