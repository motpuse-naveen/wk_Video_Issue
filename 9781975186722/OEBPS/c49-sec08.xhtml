<p class="nonindent">In patients with a urologic disorder or with marginal kidney function, care must be taken to ensure that urinary drainage is adequate and that kidney function is preserved. When urine cannot be eliminated naturally and must be drained artificially, catheters may be inserted directly into the bladder, the ureter, or the renal pelvis.</p>
<p class="indent">Catheterization is performed to achieve the following (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Gould et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3604">Taylor, 2018</a>):</p>

<p class="indent">An indwelling urinary catheter should be placed only if necessary because catheterization commonly leads to CAUTI. <a href="#ff49-3">Figure&#x00A0;49-3</a> summarizes the pathophysiology of CAUTI.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2234">Indwelling Catheters</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If an indwelling catheter is necessary, the following specific nursing interventions are initiated to prevent CAUTI (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">McCoy et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3604">Taylor, 2018</a>):</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2235">Suprapubic Catheters</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Suprapubic catheterization allows bladder drainage by inserting a catheter or tube into the bladder through a suprapubic (above the pubis) incision or puncture (see <a href="#ff49-4">Fig.&#x00A0;49-4</a>). The catheter or suprapubic drainage tube is then threaded into the bladder and secured with sutures or tape, and the area around the catheter is covered with a sterile dressing. The catheter is connected to a sterile closed drainage system, and the tubing is secured to prevent tension on the catheter. This may be a temporary measure to divert the flow of urine from the urethra when the urethral route is impassable (because of injuries, strictures, prostatic obstruction), after gynecologic or other abdominal surgery when bladder dysfunction is likely to occur, and occasionally after pelvic fractures. A permanent indwelling suprapubic catheter may be needed in the patient who is incontinent following a spinal cord injury (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Suprapubic bladder drainage may be maintained continuously for several weeks. When the patient&#x2019;s ability to void is to be tested, the catheter is clamped for 4 hours, during which time the patient attempts to void. After the patient voids, the catheter is unclamped, and the residual urine is measured. If the amount of residual urine is less than 100 mL on two separate occasions (morning and evening), the catheter is usually removed. However, if the patient complains of pain or discomfort, the suprapubic catheter is usually left in place until the patient can void successfully.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff49-4">

<img src="images/ff49-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff49-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;49-4 &#x2022;</span> Suprapubic bladder drainage. A trocar cannula is used to puncture the abdominal and bladder walls. The catheter is threaded through the trocar cannula, which is then removed, leaving the catheter in place. The catheter is secured by tape or sutures to prevent unintentional removal.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Suprapubic drainage offers certain advantages. Patients can usually void sooner after surgery than those with urethral catheters, and they may be more comfortable. The catheter allows greater mobility, permits measurement of residual urine without urethral instrumentation, and presents less risk of bladder infection. The suprapubic catheter is removed when it is no longer required, and a sterile dressing is placed over the site.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient requires liberal amounts of fluid to prevent encrustation around the catheter. Other potential problems include the formation of bladder stones, acute and chronic infections, and problems collecting urine. A wound-ostomy-continence (WOC) nurse may be consulted to assist the patient and family in selecting the most suitable urine collection system and to educate them about its use and care.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2236">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Patient and the System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients at high risk for CAUTI need to be identified and monitored carefully. These include women; older adults; and patients who are debilitated, malnourished, chronically ill, immunosuppressed, or have diabetes (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Newman, 2017</a>). They are observed for signs and symptoms of CAUTI: cloudy malodorous urine, hematuria, fever, chills, anorexia, and malaise. Any drainage and excoriation in the area around the urethral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1619" title="1619"></span>orifice is noted. Urine cultures provide the most accurate means of assessing a patient for infection.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Certain principles of care are essential to prevent infection in patients with a closed urinary drainage system (see <a href="#ct49-9">Chart&#x00A0;49-9</a>). The catheter is an object foreign to the body and produces a reaction in the urethral mucosa with some urethral discharge. Cleansing should be done on a daily basis and after bowel movements/contamination. A clean washcloth or wipe is used, cleansing from the catheter along its length from the meatus away from the patient. Disinfectants or antibacterial lubricants have not been found to decrease infections. Water in the wash basin used for daily cleansing is avoided as it may harbor microbes. Using disposable wipes that contain purified water, aloe, and vitamin E has been shown to decrease the incidence of CAUTIs (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Newman, 2017</a>). Vigorous cleansing of the meatus while the catheter is in place is discouraged because the cleansing action can move the catheter back and forth, increasing the risk of infection. The catheter is anchored as securely as possible to prevent it from moving in the urethra (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Gould et al., 2019</a>). Special care should be taken to ensure that any patient who is confused does not remove the catheter with the retention balloon still inflated, because this could cause bleeding and considerable injury to the urethra.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Preventing Infection in the Patient with an Indwelling Urinary Catheter</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid contamination of the drainage spout. A receptacle in which to empty the bag is provided for each patient.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid routine catheter changes. The catheter is changed only to correct problems such as leakage, blockage, or encrustations.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid unnecessary handling or manipulation of the catheter by the patient or staff.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Carry out hand hygiene before and after handling the catheter, tubing, or drainage bag.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ensure a free flow of urine to prevent infection. Improper drainage occurs when the tubing is kinked or twisted, allowing pools of urine to collect in the tubing loops.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Evaluate the benefit of placing an indwelling urinary catheter versus the risk of the patient developing a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the collection bag <em>must</em> be raised above the level of the patient&#x2019;s bladder, clamp the drainage tube. This prevents backflow of contaminated urine into the patient&#x2019;s bladder from the bag.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Monitor the patient&#x2019;s voiding when the catheter is removed. The patient must void within 8 hours; if unable to void, the patient may require catheterization with a straight catheter.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Never disconnect the tubing to obtain urine samples, to irrigate the catheter, or to ambulate or transport the patient.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Never irrigate the catheter routinely. If the patient is prone to obstruction from clots or large amounts of sediment, use a three-way system with continuous irrigation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Never leave the catheter in place longer than is necessary to decrease the risk of CAUTI.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain a urine specimen for culture at the first sign of infection.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>To prevent contamination of the closed system, <em>never</em> disconnect the tubing. The drainage bag must <em>never</em> touch the floor. The bag and collecting tubing are changed if contamination occurs, if urine flow becomes obstructed, or if tubing junctions start to leak at the connections.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>To reduce the risk of bacterial proliferation, empty the collection bag at least every 8 hours through the drainage spout&#x2014;more frequently if there is a large volume of urine.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use scrupulous aseptic technique during insertion of the catheter. Use a preassembled, sterile, closed urinary drainage system of the smallest catheter size possible to minimize trauma.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wash the perineal area with soap and water at least twice a day; avoid a to-and-fro motion of the catheter. Dry the area well, but avoid applying powder because it may irritate the perineum.</p>

<p class="indent">A liberal fluid intake, within the limits of the patient&#x2019;s cardiac and renal reserve, and an increased urine output must be ensured to flush the catheter and to dilute urinary substances that might form encrustations (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Newman, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Urine cultures are obtained as prescribed or indicated when monitoring the patient for infection; many catheters have an aspiration (puncture) port from which a specimen can be obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Bacteriuria is considered inevitable in patients with indwelling catheters; therefore, controversy remains about the usefulness of taking cultures and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, because overtreatment may lead to resistant strains of bacteria. Continual observation for fever, chills, and other signs and symptoms of systemic infection is necessary. Infections are treated aggressively.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Retraining the Bladder</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When an indwelling urinary catheter is in place, the detrusor muscle does not actively contract the bladder wall to stimulate emptying because urine is continuously draining from the bladder. As a result, the detrusor may not immediately respond to bladder filling when the catheter is removed, resulting in either urine retention or urinary incontinence. This condition, known as postcatheterization detrusor instability, can be managed with bladder retraining (see <a href="#ct49-10">Chart&#x00A0;49-10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately after the indwelling catheter is removed, the patient is placed on a timed voiding schedule, usually every 2 to 3 hours. At the given time interval, the patient is instructed to void. The bladder is then scanned using a portable ultrasonic bladder scanner, and if the bladder has not emptied completely, straight catheterization may be performed (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Newman, 2017</a>). After a few days, as the nerve endings in the bladder wall become resensitized to the bladder filling and emptying, bladder function usually returns to normal. If the patient has had an indwelling catheter in place for an extended period (e.g., greater than 1 month), bladder retraining will take longer; in some cases, function may never return to normal, and long-term intermittent catheterization may become necessary.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Assisting with Intermittent Self-Catheterization</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intermittent self-catheterization provides periodic drainage of urine from the bladder. By promoting drainage and eliminating excessive residual urine, intermittent catheterization <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1620" title="1620"></span>protects the kidneys, reduces the incidence of UTIs, and improves continence. It is the treatment of choice in some patients with spinal cord injury and other neurologic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, when the ability to empty the bladder is impaired. Self-catheterization promotes independence, results in few complications, and enhances self-esteem and quality of life.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Bladder Retraining After Indwelling Catheterization</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Instruct the patient to drink a measured amount of fluid from 8 <small>AM</small> to 10 <small>PM</small> to avoid bladder overdistention. Offer no fluids (except sips) after 10 <small>PM.</small></p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>At specific times, ask the patient to void by applying pressure over the bladder, tapping the abdomen, or running water to trigger the bladder.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Immediately after the voiding attempt, perform a bladder scan to determine the amount of residual urine (see Chapter&#x00A0;47, <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#ff47-8">Fig.&#x00A0;47-8</a>).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Measure the volumes of urine voided.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Palpate the bladder at repeated intervals to assess for distention.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Instruct the patient who has no voiding sensation to be alert to any signs that indicate a full bladder, such as perspiration, cold hands or feet, or feelings of anxiety.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Perform straight catheterization, as prescribed, usually for residual urine of &#x003E;300 mL.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lengthen the intervals between catheterizations as the volume of residual urine decreases. Catheterization is usually discontinued when the volume of residual urine is &#x003C;100 mL.</p>

Welch (Eds.). <em>Core curriculum for urologic nursing</em>. Pitman, NJ: Society of Urologic Nurses and Associates.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When educating the patient about how to perform self-catheterization, the nurse often teaches the patient to use a &#x201C;clean technique&#x201D; (nonsterile) at home (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Antibacterial liquid soap is recommended for cleaning urinary catheters at home. The catheter is thoroughly rinsed with warm tap water and must be dried before reuse. It should be kept in its own container, such as a plastic food storage bag.</p>
<p class="indent">In educating the patient, the nurse emphasizes the importance of frequent catheterization and emptying the bladder at the prescribed time. The average daytime clean intermittent catheterization schedule is every 4 to 6 hours and just before bedtime. If the patient is awakened at night with an urge to void, catheterization may be performed after an attempt is made to void normally.</p>
<p class="indent">The female patient assumes a Fowler position and uses a mirror to help locate the urinary meatus. She lubricates the catheter and inserts it 7.5 cm (3 inches) into the urethra, in a downward and backward direction. The male patient assumes a Fowler or sitting position, lubricates the catheter, and retracts the foreskin of the penis with one hand while grasping the penis and holding it at a right angle to the body. (This maneuver straightens the urethra and makes it easier to insert the catheter.) He inserts the catheter 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) until urine begins to flow. After removal, the catheter is cleaned, rinsed, dried, and placed in a plastic bag or case. Patients who follow an intermittent catheterization routine should consult a primary provider at regular intervals to assess urinary function and to detect complications. If the patient cannot perform intermittent self-catheterization, a family member or caregiver may be taught to carry out the procedure at regular intervals during the day.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative to self-catheterization is creation of the Mitrofanoff umbilical appendicovesicostomy, which provides easy access to the bladder but requires an extensive surgical procedure (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">King, 2017</a>). In this procedure, the bladder neck is closed and the appendix is used to create access to the bladder from the skin surface through a submucosal tunnel created with the appendix. One end of the appendix is brought to the skin surface and used as a stoma, and the other end is tunneled into the bladder. The appendix serves as an artificial urinary sphincter when an alternative is necessary to empty the bladder. A surgically prepared continent urine reservoir with a sphincter mechanism is required in cases of bladder cancer and severe interstitial cystitis. Various types of urinary diversions may be used when a radical <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cystectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of the urinary bladder">cystectomy</button></strong> (surgical removal of the bladder) is necessary (see discussion later in chapter).</p>
