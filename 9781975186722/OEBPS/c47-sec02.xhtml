<h4 class="h4" id="s2086">Assessment of the Kidney and Urinary Systems</h4>
<p class="nonindent">An assessment of the kidney and urinary systems involves conducting a health history and physical assessment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2087">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Obtaining a urologic health history requires excellent communication skills, because many patients are embarrassed or uncomfortable discussing genitourinary function or symptoms (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3478">Ball, Dains, Flynn, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). It is important to use language the patient can understand and to avoid medical jargon. It is also important to review risk factors, particularly for those patients who are at high risk. For example, the nurse needs to be aware that multiparous women delivering their children vaginally have a high risk for stress urinary incontinence, which, if severe enough, can also lead to urge incontinence. People with neurologic disorders such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson&#x2019;s disease often have incomplete emptying of the bladder and urinary stasis, which may result in UTI or increasing bladder pressure, leading to overflow incontinence, hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis, or chronic kidney disease (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Risk factors for specific disorders and kidney and lower urinary tract dysfunction are summarized in <a href="c47-sec01.xhtml#tt47-1">Table&#x00A0;47-1</a> and discussed in <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapters&#x00A0;48</a> and <a href="c49.xhtml">49</a>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Dysfunction of the kidney can produce a complex array of symptoms throughout the body. Pain, changes in voiding, and gastrointestinal symptoms are particularly suggestive of urinary tract disease.</p>
<p class="h7">Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Genitourinary pain is usually caused by distention of some portion of the urinary tract as a result of obstructed urine flow or inflammation and swelling of tissues. Severity of pain is related to the sudden onset, rather than the extent of distention.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#tt47-2">Table&#x00A0;47-2</a> lists the various types of genitourinary pain, characteristics of the pain, associated signs and symptoms, and possible causes. However, kidney disease does not always involve pain. It tends to be diagnosed because of other symptoms that cause a patient to seek health care, such as pedal edema, shortness of breath, and changes in urine elimination (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Changes in Voiding</p>
<p class="nonindent">Micturition is normally a painless function that occurs approximately eight times in a 24-hour period. The average person voids 1 to 2 L of urine in 24 hours, although this amount varies depending on fluid intake, sweating, environmental temperature, vomiting, or diarrhea. Common problems associated with voiding include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urinary frequency:&lt;/b&gt; voiding more frequently than every 3&#x00A0;hours">urinary frequency</button></strong> (voiding more frequently than every 3 hours), urgency, dysuria, hesitancy, incontinence, enuresis, polyuria, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;oliguria:&lt;/b&gt; diminished urine output; less than 0.5 mL/kg/h over at least 6 hours, or less than 400 mL in 24 hours">oliguria</button></strong> (urine output less than 400 mL in 24 hours or less than 0.5 mL/kg/h over 6 hours), and hematuria. These problems and others are described in <a href="#tt47-3">Table&#x00A0;47-3</a>. Increased urinary urgency and frequency, coupled with decreasing urine volumes strongly suggest urine retention. Depending on the acuity of the onset of these symptoms, immediate bladder emptying via catheterization and evaluation may be necessary to prevent kidney dysfunction.</p>
<p class="h7">Gastrointestinal Symptoms</p>
<p class="nonindent">Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are often associated with urologic conditions because of shared autonomic and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1543" title="1543"></span>sensory innervation and renointestinal reflexes (see <a href="#tt47-3">Table&#x00A0;47-3</a>). The proximity of the right kidney to the colon, duodenum, head of the pancreas, common bile duct, liver, and gallbladder may cause gastrointestinal disturbances. The proximity of the left kidney to the colon (splenic flexure), stomach, pancreas, and spleen may also result in intestinal symptoms. The most common signs and symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal distention.</p>

<p class="h7">Unexplained Anemia</p>
<p class="nonindent">Gradual kidney dysfunction can be insidious in its presentation, although fatigue is a common symptom. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance all result from the condition known as anemia of inflammation formerly known as anemia of chronic disease. See <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> for more information on anemia of inflammation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health, Family, and Social History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Data collection about previous health problems or diseases provides the health care team with useful information for evaluating the patient&#x2019;s current urinary status. People with diabetes who have hypertension are at risk for renal dysfunction. Older men are at risk for prostatic enlargement, which causes urethral obstruction and can result in UTIs and kidney disease. People with a family history of urinary tract problems are at increased risk for renal disorders. Genetics may also influence renal conditions (see <a href="#ct47-2">Chart&#x00A0;47-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">It is also important to assess the patient&#x2019;s psychosocial status, level of anxiety, perceived threats to body image, available support systems, and sociocultural patterns.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2088">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several body systems can affect upper and lower urinary tract dysfunction, and conversely that dysfunction can affect several end organs; therefore, a head-to-toe assessment is indicated. Areas of emphasis include the abdomen, suprapubic region, genitalia, lower back, and lower extremities.</p>
<p class="indent">The kidneys are not usually palpable. However, palpation of the kidneys may detect an enlargement that could prove to be very important (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The correct technique for palpation is illustrated in <a href="#ff47-5">Figure&#x00A0;47-5</a>. It may be possible to palpate the smooth, rounded lower pole of the kidney between the hands. The right kidney is easier to detect, because it is somewhat lower than the left one. In patients with obesity, palpation of the kidneys is more difficult.</p>

<p class="indent">Renal dysfunction may produce tenderness over the costovertebral angle, which is the angle formed by the lower border of the 12th, or bottom, rib and the spine (see <a href="#ff47-6">Fig.&#x00A0;47-6</a>). The abdomen (just slightly to the right and left of the midline in both upper quadrants) is auscultated to assess for bruits (low-pitched murmurs that indicate renal artery stenosis or an aortic aneurysm). The abdomen is also assessed for the presence of ascites (accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1545" title="1545"></span>cavity), which may occur with kidney as well as liver dysfunction (see <a href="c43.xhtml">Chapter 43</a> for further discussion of ascites and liver disorders).</p>

<p class="indent">To check for residual urine, the bladder can be percussed after the patient voids. Percussion of the bladder begins at the midline just above the umbilicus and proceeds downward. The sound changes from tympanic to dull when percussing over the bladder. The bladder, which can be palpated only if it is moderately distended, feels like a smooth, firm, round mass rising out of the abdomen, usually at midline (see <a href="#ff47-7">Fig.&#x00A0;47-7</a>). Dullness to percussion of the bladder after voiding indicates incomplete bladder emptying (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Positive Outcomes with the Use of a Portable Bladder Ultrasound</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Chen, S., Chen, P., Chen, G., et al. (2018). Portable bladder ultrasound reduces incidence of urinary tract infection and shortens hospital length of stay in patients with acute ischemic stroke. <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing</em>, <em>31</em>(6), 551&#x2013;558.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Certain patient populations, such as those who have had a stroke, have high rates of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there was a change in patient outcomes, such as UTI rates, following implementation of the use of portable bladder ultrasound to measure postvoid urine residuals on a unit that provided care for patients following an acute ischemic stroke.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The medical records of all patients admitted to one unit for a 3-year period prior to the implementation of the use of portable bladder ultrasound were retrospectively reviewed and outcomes compared to all patients admitted for a 3-year period after the implementation of the use of portable bladder ultrasound.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Those patients admitted during the period after the implementation of the portable bladder ultrasound had a lower incidence of UTI (4% vs. 6.9%) and a shorter hospital length of stay (11.9 days vs. 13.6 days). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients at higher risk of UTI were patients 75 years of age or older, women, and those with a more severe stroke.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses can make a difference in patient outcomes by using portable bladder ultrasound to measure postvoid urine residuals in patients at risk for UTI when this technology is available. This study reported that UTI rates and hospital length of stay were lower following implementation of this technology. This study needs to be replicated in other patient populations at high risk for UTI.</p>

<p class="indent">Portable bladder ultrasound is another method of detecting urinary retention. These devices provide a three-dimensional image of the bladder and should be used after voiding to detect urine retention. Researchers have reported that the use of a portable bladder ultrasound reduces the rate of UTIs and shortens the length of stay for patients who have had an ischemic stroke (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3488">Chen, Chen, Chen, et al., 2018</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct47-3">Chart&#x00A0;47-3</a> and the later discussion in the bladder ultrasonography section.</p>
<p class="indent">In older men, BPH or prostatitis can cause difficulty with urination. Because the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer can mimic those of BPH, the prostate gland is palpated by digital rectal examination (DRE) as part of the yearly physical examination in men 40 years and older (see <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a>). In addition, a blood specimen is obtained to test the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level annually; the results of the DRE and PSA are then correlated. Blood is drawn for PSA before the DRE, because manipulation of the prostate can cause the PSA level to increase temporarily. The inguinal area is examined for enlarged nodes, an inguinal or femoral hernia, and varicocele (varicose veins of the spermatic cord).</p>
<p class="indent">In women, the vulva, urethral meatus, and vagina are examined (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The urethra is palpated for diverticula, and the vagina is assessed for adequate estrogen effect and any of five types of herniation: urethrocele, cystocele, pelvic prolapse, enterocele, and rectocele. Urethrocele is the bulging of the anterior vaginal wall into the urethra. Cystocele is the herniation of the bladder wall into the vaginal vault. Pelvic prolapse is bulging of the cervix into the vaginal vault. Enterocele is herniation of the bowel into the posterior vaginal wall. Rectocele is herniation of the rectum into the vaginal wall. These prolapses are graded depending on the degree of herniation. See <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="indent">The woman is asked to cough and perform a Valsalva maneuver to assess the urethra&#x2019;s system of muscular and ligament support. If urine leakage occurs, the index and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1546" title="1546"></span>middle fingers of the examiner&#x2019;s gloved hand are used to support either side of the urethra as the woman is asked to repeat the Valsalva maneuver; this is called the <em>Marshall&#x2013;Bonney maneuver.</em> If this produces urinary leakage, referral is suggested.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is assessed for edema and changes in body weight. Edema may be observed, particularly in the face and dependent parts of the body, such as the ankles and sacral areas, and suggests fluid retention. An increase in body weight commonly accompanies edema. A 1 kg weight gain equals approximately 1000 mL of fluid (1 lb is approximately 500 mL) (<a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#bib3493">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The deep tendon reflexes of the knee are examined for quality and symmetry. This is an important part of testing for neurologic causes of bladder dysfunction, because the sacral area, which innervates the lower extremities, is the same peripheral nerve area responsible for urinary continence. The gait pattern of the person with bladder dysfunction is also noted, as well as the patient&#x2019;s ability to walk toe to heel. These tests evaluate possible supraspinal causes for urinary incontinence.</p>

<p class="box5text">Recall from <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a> <span class="unfold"><strong>Lloyd Bennett</strong></span>, who presented to the emergency department with a hip fracture. What effect can significant blood loss from surgery to repair the fracture have on renal function? What clinical findings would indicate to the nurse that kidney function is impaired? What clinical assessment findings would alert the nurse of potential trauma to the urinary tract resulting from the hip fracture? What diagnostic tests may be used to identify a urinary tract complication that the nurse would consider for preparatory patient education?</p>
