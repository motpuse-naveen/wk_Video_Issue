<p class="nonindent">Unlike HAV, the HBV is transmitted primarily through blood (percutaneous and permucosal routes). HBV can be found in blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions and can be transmitted through mucous membranes and breaks in the skin. HBV is also transferred from carrier mothers to their infants, especially in areas with a high incidence (e.g., Southeast Asia). The infection usually is not transmitted via the umbilical vein but from the mother at the time of birth and during close contact afterward.</p>
<p class="indent">HBV has a long incubation period. It replicates in the liver and remains in the serum for relatively long periods, allowing transmission of the virus. Risk factors for HBV infection are summarized in <a href="#ct43-7">Chart 43-7</a>. Screening of blood <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1388" title="1388"></span>donors has greatly reduced the occurrence of HBV after blood transfusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Most people (more than 90%) who contract HBV infection develop antibodies and recover spontaneously in 6&#x00A0;months. The mortality rate from acute HBV has been reported to be as high as 1%. Another 10% of patients who have HBV progress to a carrier state or develop chronic hepatitis with persistent HBV infection and hepatocellular injury and inflammation. It remains a major worldwide cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with higher mortality rates (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Sedhom, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3272">Schiff et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). In fact, approximately 15% of those who develop chronic hepatitis B during adulthood die of cirrhosis or liver cancer. Mortality rates are even higher (25%) for those whose chronic infection occurs during childhood (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>). An estimated 730,000 adult residents of the United States are afflicted with chronic hepatitis B infection; however, there has been a small but significant decrease in the prevalence among U.S.-born adults who are 20 to 49 years of age (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Sedhom, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1839"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The immune system is altered in older adults. A less responsive immune system may be responsible for the increased incidence and severity of HBV among older adults and the increased incidence of liver abscesses secondary to decreased phagocytosis by the Kupffer cells. The older patient with HBV has a serious risk of severe liver cell necrosis or acute hepatic failure, particularly if other illnesses are present. With the advent of an HBV vaccine as the standard for prevention, the incidence of hepatic diseases may decrease in the future.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1840">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinically, HBV closely resembles HAV, but the incubation period is much longer (1 to 6 months). Signs and symptoms of HBV may be insidious and variable. Fever and respiratory symptoms are rare; some patients have arthralgias and rashes. The patient may have loss of appetite, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, generalized aching, malaise, and weakness. Jaundice may or may not be evident. If jaundice occurs, light-colored stools and dark urine accompany it. The liver may be tender and enlarged to 12 to 14 cm vertically. The spleen is enlarged and palpable in a few patients; the posterior cervical lymph nodes may also be enlarged. Subclinical episodes also occur frequently.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1841">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">HBV is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus composed of the following antigenic particles:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>HBcAg&#x2014;hepatitis B core antigen (antigenic material in an inner core)</span></li>
<li><span>HBsAg&#x2014;hepatitis B surface antigen (antigenic material on the viral surface, a marker of active replication and infection)</span></li>
<li><span>HBeAg&#x2014;an independent protein circulating in the blood</span></li>
<li><span>HBxAg&#x2014;gene product of X gene of HBV DNA</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Each antigen elicits its specific antibody and is a marker for different stages of the disease process:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>anti-HBc&#x2014;antibody to core antigen of HBV; persists during the acute phase of illness; may indicate continuing HBV in the liver</span></li>
<li><span>anti-HBs&#x2014;antibody to surface determinants on HBV; detected during late convalescence; usually indicates recovery and development of immunity</span></li>
<li><span>anti-HBe&#x2014;antibody to hepatitis B e-antigen; usually signifies reduced infectivity</span></li>
<li><span>anti-HBxAg&#x2014;antibody to the hepatitis B x-antigen; may indicate ongoing replication of HBV</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">HBsAg appears in the circulation in 80% to 90% of infected patients 1 to 10 weeks after exposure to HBV and 2 to 8 weeks before the onset of symptoms or an increase in transferase levels. Patients with HBsAg that persists for 6 months or longer after acute infection are considered to be HBsAg carriers (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Sedhom, 2018</a>). HBeAg is the next antigen of HBV to appear in the serum. It usually appears within 1 week of the appearance of HBsAg but before changes in aminotransferase levels; it disappears from the serum within 2 weeks. HBV DNA, detected by polymerase chain reaction testing, appears in the serum at about the same time as HBeAg. HBcAg is not always detected in the serum in HBV infection.</p>
<p class="indent">In the United States, the number of cases of chronic HBV is estimated to be 0.8 to 1.4 million persons. However, an accurate estimate is difficult to obtain because there is no national chronic-hepatitis surveillance program (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3324">Younossi, Stepanova, Younossi, et al., 2019</a>). In 2013, males who died with HBV had a mortality rate that was nearly three times the mortality rate of females who died with HBV (0.8 deaths/100,000 population compared to 0.3 deaths/100,000 population). From 2009 to 2013, HBV-related mortality remained relatively stable for males and females (CDC, 2017). In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 887,000 deaths worldwide, mostly from cirrhosis and HCC (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3319">World Health Organization [WHO], 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1842">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention of hepatitis B transmission requires a multifaceted approach, including public health interventions and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1389" title="1389"></span>education as well as programs to foster immunization against this virulent virus in an effort to reduce the disease burden.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Transmission</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Continued screening of blood donors for the presence of hepatitis B antigen (HBAg) further decreases the risk of transmission by blood transfusion. The use of disposable syringes, needles, and lancets and the introduction of needleless IV administration systems have reduced the risk of spreading this infection from one patient to another or to health care personnel during the collection of blood samples or the administration of parenteral therapy. In the clinical laboratory and the hemodialysis unit, work areas are disinfected daily. Gloves are worn when handling all blood and body fluids, as well as HBAg&#x2013;positive specimens, or when there is potential exposure to blood (e.g., blood drawing) or to patients&#x2019; secretions. Eating is prohibited in the laboratory and in other areas exposed to secretions, blood, or blood products. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease, its infectiousness, and prognosis is a critical factor in preventing transmission and protecting contacts (see <a href="c43-sec12.xhtml#ct43-5">Chart 43-5</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Active Immunization: HBV</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Active immunization is recommended for people who are at high risk for HBV (e.g., health care personnel, patients undergoing hemodialysis). In addition, people with HCV and other chronic liver diseases should receive the vaccine. In 2018, the Advisory Committee on Immunization <strong>Practices</strong> (<strong>ACIP</strong>) recommended the use of a newly licensed hepatitis B vaccine, HEPLISAV-B, for people over the age of 18. This new vaccine is administered in two doses given 1 month apart. The decreased number of doses and abbreviated time period between doses may increase the rates of completion of the full vaccine series (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to 2019, a yeast-recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was used to provide active immunity and has shown rates of protection greater than 90% in healthy people (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3286">Chan, Wong, Qin, et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3312">Terrault, Lok, McMahon, et al., 2018</a>). Although antibody levels may become low or undetectable, immunologic memory may remain intact for at least 5 to 10&#x00A0;years. Measurable levels of antibodies may not be essential for protection. In general, in those with normal immune systems, booster doses are not required, and no data support the use of booster doses of hepatitis B vaccine among people who are immunocompetent and have responded to the vaccination series. However, booster doses are recommended for people who are immunocompromised (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). A hepatitis B vaccine prepared from plasma of humans chronically infected with HBV is used only rarely in patients who are immunodeficient or allergic to recombinant yeast-derived vaccines.</p>
<p class="indent">Hepatitis B vaccines should be administered to adults in the deltoid muscle. Antibody response may be measured by anti-HBs levels 1 to 3 months after completion of the basic course of vaccine, but this testing is not routine and is not currently recommended. People who do not respond may benefit from additional doses (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">People at high risk, including nurses and other health care personnel exposed to blood or blood products, should receive active immunization. Health care workers who have had frequent contact with blood are screened for anti-HBs to determine whether immunity is already present from previous exposure. The vaccine produces active immunity to HBV in 90% to 95% of healthy people (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). It does not provide protection to those already exposed to HBV nor does it provide protection against other types of viral hepatitis.</p>
<p class="indent">Because HBV infection is frequently transmitted sexually, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all people who are unvaccinated and are being evaluated for a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is also recommended for those with a history of an STI, people with multiple sex partners, people who have sex with people who use injection drugs, and men who are sexually active and have sex with other men (CDC, 2017; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Universal childhood vaccination for hepatitis B prevention has been instituted in the United States, and universal vaccination of all infants is encouraged. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for all children and prepubertal adolescents up to the age of 19 years who have not been previously immunized (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Feldman et al., 2016</a>). Development of chronic carrier states has not been reported in adult responders to the vaccine.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Passive Immunity: Hepatitis B Immune Globulin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) provides passive immunity to HBV and is indicated for people exposed to HBV who have never had hepatitis B and have never received hepatitis B vaccine. Specific indications for postexposure vaccine with HBIG include inadvertent exposure to HBAg-positive blood through percutaneous (needlestick) or transmucosal (splashes in contact with mucous membrane) routes, sexual contact with people positive for HBAg, and perinatal exposure (infants born to HBV-infected mothers should receive HBIG within 12 hours after delivery). HBIG is prepared from plasma selected for high titers of anti-HBs. Prompt immunization with HBIG (within hours to a few days after exposure to hepatitis B) increases the likelihood of protection. Both active and passive immunization are recommended for people who have been exposed to HBV through sexual contact or through the percutaneous or transmucosal routes. If HBIG and hepatitis B vaccines are given at the same time, separate sites and separate syringes should be used. HBIG is considered very safe, and there has been no evidence that infectious diseases have been transmitted due its administration (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chi et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1843">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Goals are to minimize infectivity and liver inflammation and decrease symptoms. Of all the agents that have been used to treat chronic type B viral hepatitis, alpha-interferon is the single modality of therapy that offers the most promise. A regimen of 5 million U daily or 10 million U three times weekly for 16 to 24 weeks results in remission of disease in approximately one third of patients (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). A prolonged course of treatment may also have additional benefits and is under study. Interferon must be given by injection and has significant side effects, including fever, chills, anorexia, nausea, myalgias, and fatigue. Delayed side effects are more serious and may necessitate dosage reduction or discontinuation. These include bone marrow suppression, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1390" title="1390"></span>thyroid dysfunction, alopecia, and bacterial infections. Several recombinant forms of alpha-interferon are also available, including the pegylated form (peginterferon alfa-2a), with once-weekly dosing. Pegylated interferon, also referred to as peginterferon, has largely replaced standard interferon due to its dosing schedule (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends pegylated interferon, entecavir or tenofovir, as preferred initial therapy for adults with chronic hepatitis B (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">AASLD, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). These two antiviral agents, entecavir and tenofovir, are oral nucleoside analogs approved for use in chronic hepatitis B in the United States. They are the currently recommended agents for patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">AASLD, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). Studies have revealed improved seroconversion rates and loss of detectable virus, improved liver function, and reduced progression to cirrhosis with entecavir and tenofovir. These agents can also be used for patients with decompensated cirrhosis who are awaiting liver transplantation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Terrault et al., 2018</a>). Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have such severely damaged liver parenchyma that normal liver function severely deteriorates, resulting in life-threatening ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal hemorrhage (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bed rest may be recommended until the symptoms of hepatitis have subsided. Activities are restricted until the hepatic enlargement and levels of serum bilirubin and liver enzymes have decreased. Gradually, increased activity is then allowed.</p>
<p class="indent">Adequate nutrition should be maintained. Proteins are not restricted. Protein intake should be 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/day (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Yao et al., 2018</a>). Measures to control the dyspeptic symptoms and general malaise include the use of antacids and antiemetic agents, but all medications should be avoided if vomiting occurs. If vomiting persists, the patient may require hospitalization and fluid therapy. Because of the mode of transmission, the patient is evaluated for other bloodborne diseases (e.g., human immune deficiency virus infection).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1844">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Convalescence may be prolonged, with complete symptomatic recovery sometimes requiring 3 to 4 months or longer (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Papadakis &#x0026; McPhee, 2020</a>). During this stage, gradual resumption of physical activity is encouraged after the jaundice has resolved.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse identifies psychosocial issues and concerns, particularly the effects of separation from family and friends if the patient is hospitalized during the acute and infective stages. Even if not hospitalized, the patient will be unable to work and must avoid sexual contact. Planning is required to minimize social isolation. Planning that includes the family helps to reduce their fears and anxieties about the spread of the disease.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the prolonged period of convalescence, the patient and family must be prepared for care in the home. Provision for adequate rest and nutrition must be ensured. The nurse educates family members and friends who have had intimate contact with the patient about the risks of contracting HBV and makes arrangements for them to receive hepatitis B vaccine or HBIG as prescribed. Those at risk must be made aware of the early signs of HBV and of ways to reduce risk by avoiding all modes of transmission. Patients with all forms of hepatitis should avoid drinking alcohol (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Chan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Wang, Cheng, &#x0026; Kao, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Follow-up visits by a transitional or home health nurse may be needed to assess the patient&#x2019;s progress and answer family members&#x2019; questions about disease transmission. During a home visit, the nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status and confirms that the patient and family understand the importance of adequate rest and nutrition. The nurse also reinforces previous education. Because of the risk of transmission through sexual activity, strategies to prevent exchange of body fluids are recommended, such as abstinence or the use of condoms. The nurse emphasizes the importance of keeping follow-up appointments and participating in other health promotion activities and recommended health screenings.</p>
