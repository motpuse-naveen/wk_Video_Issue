<p class="nonindent">A psychiatric emergency is an urgent, serious disturbance of behavior, affect, or thought that makes the patient unable to cope with life situations and interpersonal relationships. A patient presenting with a psychiatric emergency may display overactive or violent, underactive or depressed, or suicidal behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important concern of the ED personnel is determining whether the patient is at risk for injuring self or others. The aim is to try to maintain the patient&#x2019;s self-esteem (and life, if necessary) while providing care. Determining whether the patient is under psychiatric care is important so that contact can be made with the therapist or provider who works with the patient.</p>
