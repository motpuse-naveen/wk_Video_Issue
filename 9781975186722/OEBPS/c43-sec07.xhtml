<h4 class="h4" id="s1807">Ascites</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1808">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The mechanisms responsible for the development of ascites are not completely understood. Portal hypertension and the resulting increase in capillary pressure and obstruction of venous blood flow through the damaged liver are contributing factors. The vasodilation that occurs in the splanchnic circulation (the arterial supply and venous drainage of the GI system from the distal esophagus to the midrectum, including the liver and spleen) is also a suspected causative factor. The failure of the liver to metabolize aldosterone increases sodium and water retention by the kidney. Sodium and water retention, increased intravascular fluid volume, increased lymphatic flow, and decreased synthesis of albumin by the damaged liver all contribute to the movement of fluid from the vascular system into the peritoneal space. The process becomes self-perpetuating; loss of fluid into the peritoneal space causes further sodium and water retention by the kidney in an effort to maintain the vascular fluid volume.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of liver damage, large amounts of albumin-rich fluid, 20 L or more, may accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>). Ascites may also occur with disorders such as cancer, kidney disease, and heart failure. With the movement of albumin from the serum to the peritoneal cavity, the osmotic pressure of the serum decreases. This, combined with increased portal pressure, results in movement of fluid into the peritoneal cavity (see <a href="#ff43-5">Fig. 43-5</a>).<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1373" title="1373"></span></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1809">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Increased abdominal girth and rapid weight gain are common presenting symptoms of ascites. The patient may be short of breath and uncomfortable from the enlarged abdomen; striae and distended veins may be visible over the abdominal wall. Umbilical hernias also occur frequently in those patients with cirrhosis. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances are common.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1810">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The presence and extent of ascites are assessed by percussion of the abdomen. When fluid has accumulated in the peritoneal cavity, the flanks bulge when the patient assumes a supine position. The presence of fluid can be confirmed by percussing for shifting dullness or by detecting a fluid wave (see <a href="#ff43-6">Fig. 43-6</a>) (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). A fluid wave is likely to be found only if a large amount of fluid is present (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>). Daily measurement and recording of abdominal girth and body weight are essential to assess the progression of ascites and its response to treatment.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1811">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The medical management of the patient with ascites includes dietary modifications, pharmacologic therapy, bed rest, paracentesis, the use of shunts, and other therapies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment for the patient with ascites is a negative sodium balance to reduce fluid retention. Table salt, salty foods, salted butter and margarine, and all canned and frozen foods that are not specifically prepared for low-sodium (2-g sodium) diets should be avoided (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto, Liu, &#x0026; Kamath, 2019</a>). It may take 2 to 3 months for the patient&#x2019;s taste buds to adjust to unsalted foods. In the meantime, the taste of unsalted foods can be improved by using salt substitutes such as lemon juice, oregano, and thyme. Commercial salt substitutes need to be approved by the patient&#x2019;s primary provider, because those that contain ammonia could precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Most salt substitutes contain potassium and should be avoided if the patient has impaired renal function. The patient should make liberal use of powdered, low-sodium milk and milk products. If fluid accumulation is not controlled with this regimen, the daily sodium allowance may be reduced further to 500 mg, and diuretic agents may be given. However, most patients will not accept such a severe sodium restriction as 500 mg, so clinicians often will not recommend it (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>

The examiner places the hands along the sides of the patient&#x2019;s flanks, then strikes one flank sharply, detecting any fluid wave with the other hand. An assistant&#x2019;s hand is placed (ulnar side down) along the patient&#x2019;s midline to prevent the fluid wave from being transmitted through the tissues of the abdominal wall.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Dietary control of ascites via strict sodium restriction is difficult to achieve at home. The likelihood that the patient will follow a 2-g sodium diet increases if the patient and the person preparing meals understand the rationale for the diet and receive periodic guidance about selecting and preparing appropriate foods. Approximately 10% of patients with ascites respond to these measures alone. Patients who do not respond and those who find sodium restriction difficult require diuretic therapy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The use of diuretic agents along with sodium restriction is successful in 90% of patients with ascites (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>). Spironolactone, an aldosterone-blocking agent, is most often the first-line therapy in patients with ascites from cirrhosis. When used with other diuretic agents, spironolactone helps prevent potassium loss. Oral diuretic agents such as furosemide may be added but should be used cautiously, because long-term use may induce severe hyponatremia (sodium depletion). Ammonium chloride and acetazolamide are contraindicated because of the possibility of precipitating hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Daily weight loss should not exceed 1 kg (2.2 lb) in patients with ascites and peripheral edema or 0.5&#x00A0;to 0.75 kg (1.1 to 1.65 lb) in patients without edema (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Bope &#x0026; Kellerman, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Fluid restriction is not attempted unless the serum sodium concentration is very low.</p>
<p class="indent">Possible complications of diuretic therapy include fluid and electrolyte disturbances (including hypovolemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremic alkalosis) (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) and encephalopathy. Encephalopathy may be precipitated by dehydration and hypovolemia. In addition, when potassium stores are depleted, the amount of ammonia in the systemic circulation increases, which may cause impaired cerebral functioning and encephalopathy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bed Rest</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In patients with ascites, an upright posture is associated with activation of the renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>). This causes reduced renal glomerular filtration and sodium excretion and a decreased response to loop diuretics. Therefore, bed rest may be a useful therapy, especially for patients whose condition is refractory to diuretic agents.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1373</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1374" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1374">p. 1374</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Paracentesis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Paracentesis is the removal of fluid (ascites) from the peritoneal cavity through a puncture or a small surgical incision through the abdominal wall under sterile conditions (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). Ultrasound guidance may be indicated in some patients who are at high risk for bleeding because of an abnormal coagulation profile and in those who have had previous abdominal surgery and may have adhesions. Paracentesis was once considered a routine form of treatment for ascites. However, it is now performed primarily for diagnostic examination of ascitic fluid; in treatment for massive ascites that is resistant to nutritional and diuretic therapy and is causing severe problems to the patient; and as a prelude to diagnostic imaging studies, peritoneal dialysis, or surgery. A sample of the ascitic fluid may be sent to the laboratory for cell count, albumin and total protein levels, culture, and other tests.</p>
<p class="indent">Large-volume (5 to 6 L) paracentesis is a safe method for treating patients with severe ascites. The use of this therapeutic intervention should not be restricted to patients in whom diuretic therapy has failed but should be considered the treatment of choice for all patients with large-volume ascites (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). This technique, in combination with the IV infusion of salt-poor albumin or other colloid, has become a standard management strategy yielding an immediate effect. Refractive, massive ascites is unresponsive to multiple diuretic agents and sodium restriction for 2 weeks or more and can result in severe sequelae such as respiratory distress, which requires rapid intervention. Albumin infusions help to correct decreases in effective arterial blood volume that lead to sodium retention. The use of this colloid reduces the incidence of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction with renal dysfunction, hyponatremia, and rapid reaccumulation of ascites associated with decreased effective arterial volume (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). The beneficial effects of albumin administration on hemodynamic stability and renal functional status may be related to an improvement in cardiac function as well as a decrease in the degree of arterial vasodilation. Although the patient with cirrhosis has a greatly increased extracellular blood volume, the kidney incorrectly senses that the intravascular volume has decreased. The renin&#x2013;angiotensin&#x2013;aldosterone axis is stimulated, and sodium is reabsorbed (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>). In addition, antidiuretic hormone secretion increases, which leads to increased retention of free water and sometimes to the development of dilutional hyponatremia. Therapeutic paracentesis provides only temporary removal of fluid; ascites rapidly recurs, necessitating repeated fluid removal.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Assisting with Paracentesis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a method of treating ascites in which a cannula is threaded into the portal vein by the transjugular route (see <a href="#ff43-7">Fig. 43-7</a>). To reduce portal hypertension, an expandable stent is inserted to serve as an intrahepatic shunt between the portal circulation and the hepatic vein. This is extremely effective in decreasing sodium retention, improving the renal response to diuretic therapy, and preventing recurrence of fluid accumulation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). TIPS is an effective management strategy for refractive ascites. However, due to a higher risk of encephalopathy and higher cost of TIPS compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, many consider TIPS a second-line therapy for refractive ascites that continues to occur despite medical management (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hung &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>).</p>

A stent is inserted via catheter to the portal vein to divert blood flow and reduce portal hypertension.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Because the development of ascites in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a 50% mortality rate, patients considered candidates for liver transplantation may be referred for TIPS if paracentesis is contraindicated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Methods of Treatment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ascites can also be treated by the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt to redirect ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the systemic circulation via an abdominal and a thoracic catheter that drain into the superior vena cava through a one-way valve (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Hammer &#x0026; McPhee, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Simonetto et al., 2019</a>). However, this procedure is rarely used due to the availability of newer, more effective therapies such as TIPS. In patients with ESLD, some with refractory ascites may be candidates for peritoneal catheters for palliation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3297">Macken, Hashim, Mason, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1812">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If a patient with ascites from liver dysfunction is hospitalized, nursing measures include assessment and documentation of intake and output (I&#x0026;O), abdominal girth, and daily weight to assess fluid status. The nurse also closely monitors the respiratory status because large volumes of ascites can compress the thoracic cavity and inhibit adequate lung expansion. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1375" title="1375"></span>The nurse monitors serum ammonia, creatinine, and electrolyte levels to assess electrolyte balance, response to therapy, and indications of hepatic encephalopathy.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon21.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient treated for ascites is likely to be discharged with some ascites still present. Before hospital discharge, the nurse educates the patient and family about the treatment plan, including the need to avoid all alcohol intake, adhere to a low-sodium diet, take medications as prescribed, and check with the primary provider before taking any new medications, including OTC and herbal preparations. Additional home care education is summarized in <a href="c43-sec08.xhtml#ct43-3">Chart 43-3</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A referral for transitional, home, or community-based care may be warranted, especially if the patient lives alone or cannot provide self-care. The home visit enables the nurse to assess changes in the patient&#x2019;s condition and weight, abdominal girth, skin, and cognitive and emotional status. The nurse assesses the home environment and the availability of resources needed to adhere to the treatment plan (e.g., a scale to obtain daily weights, facilities to prepare and store appropriate foods, resources to purchase needed medications). The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s adherence to the treatment plan and the ability to buy, prepare, and eat appropriate foods. The nurse reinforces previous education and emphasizes the need for regular follow-up and the importance of keeping scheduled health care appointments.</p>
