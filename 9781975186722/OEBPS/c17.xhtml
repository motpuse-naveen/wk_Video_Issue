<p class="nonindent">Disorders of the respiratory system are common and are encountered by nurses in every setting, from the community to the intensive care unit. Expert assessment skills must be developed and used to provide the best care for patients with acute and chronic respiratory problems. Alterations in respiratory status have been identified as important predictors of clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1355">Institute for Healthcare Improvement [IHI], 2019</a>). To differentiate between normal and abnormal assessment findings and recognize subtle changes that may negatively impact patient outcomes, nurses require an understanding of respiratory function and the significance of abnormal diagnostic test results.</p>
