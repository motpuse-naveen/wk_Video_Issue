<h4 class="h4" id="s3085">Cerebral Metastases</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A significant number of patients with cancer experience neurologic deficits caused by metastasis to the nervous system, which can include the brain, CSF, and meninges. Metastatic lesions to the brain are more common than primary brain tumors and have an associated 2-year survival rate of less than 10% (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Achrol et al., 2019</a>). The high number of metastatic brain tumors is clinically important, as more patients with all forms of cancer live longer because of improved therapies. Neurologic signs and symptoms include headache, gait disturbances, visual impairment, personality changes, altered mentation (memory loss and confusion), focal weakness, paralysis, aphasia, and seizures (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). These signs and symptoms can be devastating to both patient and family. Metastases to the CSF and meninges, known as leptomeningeal metastases, can produce symptoms of headache and isolated cranial nerve deficits.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3086">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment of metastatic nervous system cancer is palliative and involves eliminating or reducing serious symptoms. Even when palliation is the goal, distressing signs and symptoms can be relieved, thereby improving the quality of life for both patient and family (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). Patients with intracerebral metastases who are not treated have a poor prognosis with a limited survival time. The therapeutic options include whole brain radiation therapy (the foundation of treatment) for multiple metastases or stereotactic radiosurgery for up to three sites of metastases. Surgery may be considered for a single symptomatic metastasis. Systemic chemotherapy directed at the primary cancer may be ineffective in crossing the blood&#x2013;brain barrier, but chemotherapy that crosses this barrier may be added. Intrathecal chemotherapy, with direct injection of chemotherapy agents into the CSF of the brain or spinal canal, may be useful in persons with metastases (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4529">Song, Li, Yin, et al., 2018</a>). Some combination of these treatments is usually the optimal method.</p>
<p class="indent">Pain can be a significant problem and is managed by means of a stepped progression in the doses and type of analgesic agents needed for relief. If the patient has severe pain, morphine can be infused into the epidural or subarachnoid space through a spinal needle and a catheter placed as near as possible to the spinal segment where the pain is projected. Small doses of morphine are given at prescribed intervals (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph1_1" id="nurse64"><strong>The Patient with Nervous System Metastases or Primary Brain Tumor</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The nursing assessment includes a baseline neurologic examination and focuses on how the patient is functioning, moving, and walking; adapting to weakness or paralysis and to loss of vision and speech; and dealing with seizures. Assessment addresses symptoms that cause distress to the patient and affect the quality of life, including pain, respiratory problems, bowel and bladder disorders, and sleep disturbances, as well as impairment of skin integrity, fluid balance, and temperature regulation (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Nutritional status is assessed, because cachexia and cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome are common (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse takes a dietary history to assess food intake, intolerance, and preferences. Calculation of body mass index can confirm the loss of subcutaneous fat and lean body mass (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2119" title="2119"></span>Biochemical measurements are reviewed to assess the degree of malnutrition, impaired cellular immunity, and electrolyte balance (normal laboratory values are found in Appendix A on <img class="m" src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/>). A dietitian assists in determining the caloric needs of the patient.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse works with other members of the health care team to assess the impact of the illness on the family in terms of home care, altered relationships, financial problems, time pressures, and family problems. This information is important in helping family members cope with the diagnosis and the changes associated with it.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired self-feeding, impaired ability to perform hygiene, impaired ability to dress, and impaired self-toileting associated with loss or impairment of motor and sensory functions and decreased cognitive abilities</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional status associated with cachexia due to treatment and tumor effects, decreased nutritional intake, and malabsorption</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional status associated with increased nutritional intake and impaired metabolism</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with uncertainty, change in appearance, or altered lifestyle</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Interrupted family process associated with situational crisis imposed by the care of the person with a terminal illness</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Seizures (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>)</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Headaches (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>)</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The goals for the patient include compensating for self-care deficits, improving nutrition, reducing anxiety, enhancing family coping skills, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>C<small>OMPENSATING FOR</small> S<small>ELF</small>-C<small>ARE</small> D<small>EFICITS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient may have difficulty participating in goal setting depending on the tumor location and if cognitive function is affected. The nurse encourages the family to assist the patient to be as independent as possible for as long as possible (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Increasing assistance with self-care activities is to be expected. Because the patient with nervous system metastasis and the family live with uncertainty, they are encouraged to plan for each day and to make the most of each day. The tasks and challenges are to assist the patient to find useful coping mechanisms, adaptations, and compensations for solving problems that arise. Use of an interprofessional health care team is helpful. An individualized exercise program helps maintain strength, endurance, and range of motion. Eventually, referral for home or hospice care may be necessary (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> N<small>UTRITION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, breathlessness, and pain are rarely interested in eating. These symptoms are managed or controlled through assessment, planning, and care. The nurse educates the family about how to position the patient for comfort and safety during meals. A dietician may help with alternative food choices that are easily tolerated. Meals are planned for times when the patient is rested and in less distress from pain or the effects of treatment.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient needs to be clean, comfortable, and free of pain for meals in an environment that is as attractive as possible. Oral hygiene before meals helps to improve appetite. Offensive sights, sounds, and odors are eliminated. Creative strategies may be required to make food more palatable, provide enough fluids, and increase opportunities for socialization during meals. The family may be asked to keep a log of daily weights and to record the quantity of food eaten to determine the daily calorie count. Dietary supplements, if acceptable to the patient, can be provided to meet increased caloric needs. If the patient is not interested in most usual foods, those foods preferred by the patient should be offered. When the patient shows marked deterioration as a result of tumor growth and effects, some other form of nutritional support (e.g., tube feeding, parenteral nutrition) may be indicated if consistent with the patient&#x2019;s end-of-life preferences (AANN, 2016) (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for discussion of tube feeding and <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> for discussion of parenteral nutrition). Nursing interventions include assessing the patency of the central and intravenous lines or feeding tube, monitoring the insertion site for infection, checking the infusion rate, monitoring intake and output, and changing the intravenous tubing and dressing. Family members are instructed in these techniques if they will be providing care at home. Parenteral nutrition can be provided at home if indicated. The patient&#x2019;s quality of life may guide the selection, initiation, maintenance, and discontinuation of nutritional support. The nurse and family should not place too much emphasis on eating or on discussions about food, because the patient may not desire aggressive nutritional intervention. The subsequent course of action must be congruent with the wishes and choices of the patient and family.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Increased appetite may occur in patients receiving steroids and may result in weight gain as well as hyperglycemia. Patients and family members should be instructed to monitor weight and blood glucose (if appropriate), as well as maintain a healthy diet with caloric intake appropriate to patient needs.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patients may be restless, with changing moods that may include intense depression, euphoria, paranoia, and severe anxiety. The patient&#x2019;s response to a life-threatening illness reflects their pattern of reaction to other crisis situations. Serious illness imposes additional strains that often bring other unresolved problems to light. The patient&#x2019;s own coping strategies can help deal with anxious and depressed feelings. Health care providers need to be sensitive to the patient and caregivers&#x2019; concerns and fears (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4511">Ketcher et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients need the opportunity to exercise some control over their situation. A sense of mastery can be gained as they learn to understand the disease and its treatment and how to deal with their feelings. Researchers have reported that resilience positively influences problem-based coping strategies (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4515">Liang, Liu, Lu, et al., 2020</a>).&#x00A0;The presence of family, friends, a spiritual advisor, and health care professionals may be supportive. Brain tumor support services may provide a feeling of meaning and strength (see the Resources section).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2119</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2120" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2120">p. 2120</span></div>
<p class="processpparapindent">Spending time with patients allows them time to talk and to communicate their fears and concerns. Open communication and acknowledgment of fears are often therapeutic. Touch is also a form of communication. These patients need reassurance that continuing care will be provided and that they will not be abandoned. If a patient&#x2019;s emotional reactions are very intense or prolonged, additional help from a spiritual advisor, social worker, or mental health professional may be indicated.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> F<small>AMILY</small> P<small>ROCESSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The family needs to be reassured that their loved one is receiving optimal care and that attention will be paid to the patient&#x2019;s changing symptoms and concerns. If the patient can no longer carry out self-care, the family and additional support systems (social worker, home health aide, home health nurse, hospice nurse) may be needed. Assessment and education of family caregivers about neurologic and cognitive symptoms is necessary, acute, and challenging (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4495">Boele, Terhorst, Prince, et al., 2019</a>). Investigating resources that are available may decrease the burden on the caregivers. These efforts improve the psychosocial well-being of the patient and family caregivers (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4495">Boele et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4511">Ketcher et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> <span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient and family often have major responsibility for care at home. Caregivers may struggle with a new &#x201C;normal&#x201D; while their support systems fluctuate as their relationship with the patient they are caring for is strengthened, maintained, or strained (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4511">Ketcher et al., 2020</a>). In addition to the psychological aspect, education includes pain management strategies, prevention of complications related to treatment strategies, and methods to ensure adequate fluid and food intake (see <a href="#ct65-2">Chart&#x00A0;65-2</a>). Educational needs of the patient and family regarding care priorities are likely to change as the disease progresses; the nurse should assess the changing needs of the patient and the family and inform them about resources and services early and frequently to assist them (see the Resources section).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Home health services are valuable resources that should be made available to the patient and the family early in the course of an illness. Anticipating needs before they occur can assist in smooth initiation of services. Home health focuses on the areas of symptom and pain control, assistance in self-care, control of treatment complications, and administration of specific forms of treatment (e.g., parenteral nutrition). The nurse assesses pain management, respiratory status, complications of the disorder and its treatment, and the patient&#x2019;s cognitive and emotional status. In addition, the nurse assesses the family&#x2019;s ability to perform necessary care and notifies the primary provider about changing needs or complications, if indicated.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Steps to initiate hospice care, including discussion of hospice care as an option, should not be postponed until death is imminent for the patient with a metastasis or high-grade tumor. Exploration of hospice care as an option should be initiated at a time when hospice services can provide support and care to the patient and family consistent with their end-of-life decisions and can assist in allowing death with dignity. See <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a> for in-depth discussion of end-of-life care.</p>
