<h4 class="h4" id="s3078">Brain Tumors</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A brain tumor occupies space within the skull, growing as a spherical mass or diffusely infiltrating tissue. The effects of brain tumors are caused by inflammation, compression, and infiltration of tissue. A variety of physiologic changes result, causing any or all of the following pathophysiologic events (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>):</p>

<li><span>Seizure activity</span></li>
<li><span>Hydrocephalus</span></li>
<li><span>Altered pituitary function</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Neoplastic lesions in the brain ultimately cause death by increasing ICP and impairing vital functions, such as respiration.</p>
<p class="indent">There are over 100 types of brain tumors with an estimated 78,000 new cases each year. These include 25,000 malignant and 53,000 nonmalignant brain tumors (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4482">American Association of Neuroscience Nurses [AANN], 2016</a>). Brain tumors are classified as primary or secondary. Primary brain tumors originate from cells within the brain. In adults, most primary brain tumors originate from glial cells (cells that make up the structure and support system of the brain and spinal cord) and are supratentorial (located above the covering of the cerebellum). Primary tumors progress locally, rarely metastasize outside the CNS, and have a 5-year survival rate of 33.4% (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4502">Garcia, Slone, Dolecek, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Developed countries have a higher incidence of primary brain tumors, with rates of 5.1 per 100,000 compared to 3.0 per 100,000 in less developed countries. This is most likely due to more frequent diagnosis with improved imaging modalities. Although many risk factors have been investigated, exposure to ionizing radiation is the only known modifiable risk factor (AANN, 2016). Many genetic factors and genetic syndromes (such as neurofibromatosis) are associated with brain tumor risk in families (AANN, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary, or metastatic, brain tumors develop from structures outside the brain and are twice as common as primary brain tumors (AANN, 2016). Metastatic lesions to the brain can occur from the lung, breast, lower gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, kidney, and skin (melanomas) neoplasms. Single or multiple metastases may occur, and brain metastases may be found at any time during the disease course, even at initial diagnosis of the primary disease. Patient survival rates from primary brain cancers are improving, however, the incidence of brain metastases is increasing (AANN, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">The highest incidence of brain tumors in adults occurs in the fifth through seventh decades of life (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4535">Young, Chmura, Wainwright, et al., 2017</a>). There is a slight male predominance in the incidence of malignant brain tumors.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3079">Types of Primary Brain Tumors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Brain tumors may be classified into several groups: those arising from the coverings of the brain (e.g., dural meningioma), those developing in or on the cranial nerves (e.g., acoustic neuroma), those originating within brain tissue (e.g., glioma), and metastatic lesions originating elsewhere in the body. Tumors of the pituitary and pineal glands and of cerebral blood vessels are also types of brain tumors. Relevant clinical considerations include the location and the histologic character of the tumor. About 70% of the time tumors are benign but even benign tumors, such as colloid cysts, can occur in vital areas and can grow large enough to have serious effects (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). See <a href="#ct65-1">Chart&#x00A0;65-1</a> for the classification of brain tumors.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Gliomas</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In adults, gliomas (principally astrocytoma) account for approximately 25% of symptomatic primary brain tumors. Glial tumors, the most common type of intracerebral brain neoplasm, are divided into many categories (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). Astrocytomas, arising from astrocytic cells, are the most common type of glioma and are graded from I to IV, indicating the degree of malignancy (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). The grade is based on cellular density, cell mitosis, and degree of differentiation from the original cell type. Grades III and IV tumors are known as glioblastomas and have little resemblance to the original cell type. Astrocytomas infiltrate into the surrounding neural connective tissue and therefore cannot be totally removed without causing considerable damage to vital structures.</p>
<p class="indent">Oligodendroglial tumors, arising from oligodendroglial cells, represent about 1.4% of gliomas (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Most oligodendrogliomas occur in adults aged 50 to 60, are found in men more often than in women, and are categorized as low or high grade (anaplastic) (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Young et al., 2017</a>). The histologic distinction between astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas is difficult to make but is important, because oligodendrogliomas are more sensitive than astrocytomas to chemotherapy. Tumors originating from ependymal cells, another type of glial cell, are known as ependymomas and are more common in children than adults. Glial tumors may be treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on specific cell and patient characteristics as well as the location of the tumor (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Young et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2113</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2114" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2114">p. 2114</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Meningiomas</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Meningiomas, which represent 37% of all primary brain tumors, are common benign encapsulated tumors of arachnoid cells on the meninges (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). They are slow growing, occur most often in middle-aged adults, and are more common in women. Meningiomas often occur in areas proximal to the venous sinuses. Manifestations depend on the area involved and are often the result of compression rather than invasion of brain tissue. Preferred treatment for symptomatic lesions is surgery with complete removal or partial dissection, although radiation therapy may be useful for some patients. Metastasis is rare with meningiomas but benign meningiomas may be challenging to remove surgically without causing neurologic deficits if the tumor is located at the base of the skull or surrounds the optic nerve, or in the rare case if the tumor is invasive. Multiple meningiomas may occur with neurofibromatosis type 2 (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Euskirchen &#x0026; Peyre, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acoustic Neuromas</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acoustic neuromas account for 16% of brain tumors, with men and women equally affected, and occur most commonly in the fifth decade of life (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hong &#x0026; Moliterno, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">An acoustic neuroma is a tumor of the eighth cranial nerve&#x2014;the cranial nerve most responsible for hearing and balance. It usually arises just within the internal auditory meatus, where it frequently expands before filling the cerebellopontine recess. An acoustic neuroma may grow slowly and attain considerable size before it is diagnosed. The patient usually experiences loss of hearing, tinnitus, and episodes of vertigo and staggering gait. As the tumor becomes larger, painful sensations of the face may occur on the same side as a result of the tumor&#x2019;s compression of the fifth cranial nerve (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hong &#x0026; Moliterno, 2019</a>). Many acoustic neuromas are benign and can be managed conservatively. Many that continue to grow can be surgically removed and have a good prognosis (see <a href="c59.xhtml">Chapter 59</a>). Some acoustic neuromas may be suitable for stereotactic radiotherapy rather than open craniotomy. Stereotactic radiotherapy is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pituitary Adenomas</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pituitary tumors account for about 16% of all primary brain tumors (AANN, 2016). They can occur at any age but are more common in older adults. Women are affected more often than men, particularly during the childbearing years. Pituitary tumors are rarely malignant but cause symptoms as a result of pressure on adjacent structures or hormonal changes (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4509">Jang, Oh, Lee, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Pressure Effects of Pituitary Adenomas</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pressure from a pituitary adenoma may be exerted on the optic nerves, optic chiasm, or optic tracts or on the hypothalamus or the third ventricle if the tumor invades the cavernous sinuses or expands into the sphenoid bone. These pressure effects produce headache, visual dysfunction, hypothalamic disorders (disorders of sleep, appetite, temperature, and emotions), increased ICP, and enlargement and erosion of the sella turcica (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Donovan &#x0026; Welch, 2018</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4509">Jang et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Molitch, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hormonal Effects of Pituitary Adenomas</p>
<p class="nonindent">Functioning pituitary tumors can produce one or more hormones normally produced by the anterior pituitary. Hormonal hypersecretion is caused only by pituitary adenomas (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Molitch, 2017</a>). Many adenomas (50%) secrete an excess amount of hormone including prolactin (prolactinomas), growth hormone (GH) producing acromegaly in adults, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resulting in Cushing&#x2019;s disease, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Molitch, 2017</a>). Adenomas that secrete TSH or follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone occur infrequently, whereas adenomas that produce both GH and prolactin are relatively common.</p>
<p class="indent">The female patient whose pituitary gland is secreting excessive quantities of prolactin presents with amenorrhea or galactorrhea (excessive or spontaneous flow of milk). Male patients with prolactinomas may present with impotence and hypogonadism. Acromegaly, caused by excess GH, produces enlargement of the hands and feet, distortion of the facial features, and pressure on peripheral nerves (entrapment syndromes). The clinical features of Cushing&#x2019;s disease, a condition associated with prolonged overproduction of cortisol, occur with excessive production of ACTH. Manifestations include a form of obesity with redistribution of fat to the facial, supraclavicular, and abdominal areas; hypertension; purple striae and ecchymoses; osteoporosis; elevated blood glucose levels; and emotional disorders. See <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a> for a discussion of endocrine disorders resulting from these tumors.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3080"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of all brain tumors increases with age (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Young et al., 2017</a>). Intracranial tumors can produce personality changes, confusion, speech dysfunction, or disturbances of gait. In older adult patients, early signs and symptoms of intracranial tumors can be easily overlooked or incorrectly attributed to cognitive and neurologic changes associated with normal aging (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Neurologic signs and symptoms in the older adult must be carefully evaluated, because brain metastases occur in patients with a history of prior cancer. Regardless of the age of the patient or the decision to proceed or not with treatment, the nurse provides supportive care. Researchers have reported that the degree of frailty influences clinical outcomes of older adult patients undergoing surgery for brain tumor resection (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4504">Harland, Wang, Gunaydin, et al., 2020</a>). Patients identified as moderately frail or frail are at increased risk for a longer length of hospital stay and tend to require discharge to a long-term care facility rather than home (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Harland et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3081">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Brain tumors can produce both focal or generalized neurologic signs and symptoms. Generalized symptoms reflect increased ICP, and the most common focal or specific signs and symptoms result from tumors that interfere with functions in specific brain regions. <a href="#ff65-1">Figure&#x00A0;65-1</a> indicates common brain tumor sites.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Increased Intracranial Pressure</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As discussed in <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, the skull is a rigid compartment containing essential noncompressible contents: brain matter, intravascular blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The Monro-Kellie hypothesis or doctrine explains the dynamic equilibrium of the cranial contents. According to this hypothesis, if any one of these skull components increases in volume, ICP increases unless one of the other components decreases in volume. Consequently, any change in volume occupied by the brain (as occurs with disorders such as brain tumor or cerebral edema) produces signs and symptoms of increased ICP (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Witherspoon &#x0026; Ashby, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The enlarging tumor and its associating edema disrupts the equilibrium between the brain, blood, and CSF. As the tumor grows, compensatory adjustments may occur through compression of intracranial veins, reduction of CSF volume (by increased absorption or decreased production), a modest decrease in cerebral blood flow, or reduction of intra- and extracellular brain tissue mass. When these compensatory mechanisms fail, the patient develops signs and symptoms of increased ICP, most often including headache, nausea with or without vomiting, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;papilledema:&lt;/b&gt; swelling of the optic disc usually due to increased intracranial pressure">papilledema</button></strong> (swelling of the optic nerve) (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Personality changes and a variety of focal deficits, including motor, sensory, and cranial nerve dysfunction, are common.</p>
<p class="h7">Headache</p>
<p class="nonindent">One third of patients with brain tumors report headache as an early symptom (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Headache is most commonly reported in the early morning and is made worse by coughing, straining, or sudden movement (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Norris, 2019</a>). It is thought to be caused by the tumor invading, compressing, or distorting the pain-sensitive structures or by edema that accompanies the tumor. The headaches may be generalized or localized to the site of the tumor. As the edema increases, headache is generally bifrontal or bioccipital regardless of the tumor location (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Vomiting</p>
<p class="nonindent">Vomiting, seldom related to food intake, is usually the result of irritation of the vagal centers in the medulla (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Forceful vomiting is described as projectile vomiting. Headache may be relieved by vomiting.</p>
<p class="h7">Visual Disturbances</p>
<p class="nonindent">The tumor itself or the surrounding edema can compress the third cranial nerve, causing optic disc swelling or papilledema. This limits the visual acuity along the visual pathway, mildly or profoundly, as diplopia (double vision), hemianopsia (visual field deficits), or varying levels of blindness (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4509">Jang et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Seizures</p>
<p class="nonindent">Seizures are common in patients with brain tumors either initially or throughout their disease process (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). Seizures may be focal or generalized. Tumors of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes carry the greatest risk of seizures; seizures are unusual with brainstem or cerebellar tumors. See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for discussion about seizures and related management.</p>
<p class="indent">If not the initial presentation, seizures can be a result of metabolic factors (electrolyte imbalances, liver failure or kidney disease, radiation or chemotherapy side effects), structural causes (parenchymal metastases, leptomeningeal disease, dural metastases) or a new hemorrhage, thrombosis, or development of meningitis (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). If the patient presents with a seizure, then anticonvulsant drugs are prescribed. Medications with the best evidence for controlling <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2116" title="2116"></span>seizure activity include levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and zonisamide (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Localized Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When specific regions of the brain are affected, local signs and symptoms occur, such as sensory or motor abnormalities, visual alterations, alterations in cognition, or language disturbances (e.g., aphasia). Identifying the signs and symptoms is important, because it can help identify tumor location. Some tumors are not easily localized because they lie in so-called silent areas of the brain (i.e., areas in which functions are not well defined). Many tumors can be localized by correlating the signs and symptoms to specific areas in the brain, as follows (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>):</p>
<p class="BL1First0"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>A tumor in the motor cortex of the frontal lobe produces hemiparesis and partial seizures on the opposite side of the body or generalized seizures. A frontal lobe tumor may also produce changes in emotional state and behavior, as well as an apathetic mental attitude. The patient often becomes impulsive, inappropriate in speech, gestures, and behavior.</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>A parietal lobe tumor may cause decreased sensation on the opposite side of the body or generalized seizures.</span></li>
<li><span>A temporal lobe tumor may cause seizures as well as psychological disorders.</span></li>
<li><span>An occipital lobe tumor produces visual manifestations: contralateral homonymous hemianopsia (visual loss in half of the visual field on the opposite side of the tumor) and visual hallucinations.</span></li>
<li><span>A cerebellar tumor causes dizziness; an ataxic or staggering gait with a tendency to fall toward the side of the lesion; marked muscle incoordination; and nystagmus (involuntary rhythmic eye movements), usually in the horizontal direction.</span></li>
<li><span>A cerebellopontine angle tumor usually originates in the sheath of the acoustic nerve and gives rise to a characteristic sequence of symptoms. Tinnitus and vertigo appear first, soon followed by progressive nerve deafness (eighth cranial nerve dysfunction). Numbness and tingling of the face and tongue occur (due to involvement of the fifth cranial nerve). Later, weakness or paralysis of the face develops (seventh cranial nerve involvement). Finally, because the enlarging tumor presses on the cerebellum, abnormalities in motor function may be present.</span></li>
<li><span>Brainstem tumors may be associated with cranial nerve deficits along with complex motor and sensory function impairments (see <a href="c64.xhtml">Chapter 64</a>, <a href="c64-sec11.xhtml#tt64-3">Table&#x00A0;64-3</a>).</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3082">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The history of the illness, the manner, and the time frame in which the symptoms evolved are key components in the diagnosis of brain tumors. A neurologic examination indicates the involved areas of the CNS. To assist in the precise localization of the lesion, a battery of tests is performed. Computed tomography (CT) scans, enhanced by a contrast agent, can give specific information concerning the number, size, and density of the lesions, and the extent of secondary cerebral edema. CT can provide information about the ventricular system. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the most helpful diagnostic tool for detecting brain tumors, particularly smaller lesions, and tumors in the brainstem and pituitary regions, where bone is thick. MRI is also useful in monitoring response to treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Computer-assisted stereotactic (three-dimensional) biopsy is used to diagnose deep-seated brain tumors and to provide a basis for treatment and prognosis. Stereotactic approaches involve the use of a three-dimensional frame that allows very precise localization of the tumor; a stereotactic frame and multiple imaging studies (x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs) are used to localize the tumor and verify its position (see <a href="#ff65-2">Fig.&#x00A0;65-2</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2117" title="2117"></span>Brain-mapping technology helps determine the proximity of diseased areas of the brain to structures essential for normal brain function.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff65-2">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff65-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff65-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;65-2 &#x2022;</span> <strong>A.</strong> Using stereotactic or &#x201C;brain-mapping&#x201D; guided approach, a three-dimensional computer image fuses the computed tomography image and magnetic resonance image to pinpoint the exact location of the brain tumor. This low-grade astrocytoma is localized adjacent to the brainstem, is inoperable, and is treated with radiation. Note the optic chasm and optic nerves. <strong>B.</strong> Computerized image of the prescribed radiation dose.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Positron emission tomography (PET) is used to supplement MRI scanning in many centers. On PET scans, low-grade tumors are associated with hypometabolism, and high-grade tumors show hypermetabolism. This information can be useful in making treatment decisions (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4488">Achrol, Rennert, Anders, et al., 2019</a>). An electroencephalogram can detect abnormal brain waves in regions occupied by or adjacent to tumor; it is used to evaluate temporal lobe seizures and to assist in ruling out other disorders. Cytologic studies of the CSF may be performed to detect malignant cells as CNS tumors can shed cells into the CSF resulting in metastasis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3083">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A variety of medical management approaches, including surgery, chemotherapy, and external-beam radiation therapy, are used alone or in combination (AANN, 2016; <a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). A relatively new treatment option for glioblastomas is tumor-treating fields. This device provides alternating electric field therapy that disrupts the mitotic process and is worn on the head (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). The main side effect is skin irritation.</p>
<p class="indent">Secreting tumors may be treated with medications that suppress hormones. Nonfunctioning tumors may have no effect on pituitary function or may suppress hormone production and release. Hormone replacement may be necessary for these patients to restore normal endocrine function. The management of brain tumors is complex and requires an interdisciplinary approach to care to optimize patient outcomes (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Achrol et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The objective of surgical management is to remove as much tumor as possible without increasing the neurologic deficit (paralysis, blindness), or to relieve symptoms by partial removal (decompression). Surgery also provides the opportunity to biopsy tissue to establish a definitive diagnosis. A variety of surgical approaches may be used; the specific approach depends on the type of tumor, its location, and its accessibility. Conventional surgical approaches require a craniotomy (incision into the skull). See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a> for a discussion of care of the patient who has undergone a craniotomy. This approach is used in patients with meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, cystic astrocytomas of the cerebellum, colloid cysts of the third ventricle, congenital tumors such as dermoid cyst, and some of the granulomas. With improved imaging techniques and the availability of the operating microscope and microsurgical instrumentation, even large tumors can be removed through a relatively small craniotomy. For patients with malignant glioma, complete removal of the tumor and cure are not possible, but the rationale for resection includes relief of ICP, removal of any necrotic tissue, and reduction in the bulk of the tumor, which theoretically leaves behind fewer cells to become resistant to radiation or chemotherapy. Most pituitary adenomas are treated by transsphenoidal microsurgical removal (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>), and the remainder of tumors that cannot be removed completely are treated by radiation (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radiation Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radiation therapy&#x2014;the cornerstone of treatment for many brain tumors&#x2014;decreases the incidence of recurrence of incompletely resected tumors (AANN, 2016). Gamma radiation is delivered via an external beam to the tumor in multiple fractions. Brachytherapy (the surgical implantation of radiation sources to deliver high doses at a short distance) is an option for some types of tumors depending on their location. It is usually used as an adjunct to conventional radiation therapy or as a rescue measure for recurrent disease. Radioisotopes such as iodine 131 (<sup>131</sup>I) are used to minimize effects on surrounding brain tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">Stereotactic procedures may be performed using a linear accelerator or gamma knife to perform radiosurgery (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). These procedures allow treatment of deep, inaccessible tumors, often in a single session. Precise localization of the tumor is accomplished by the stereotactic approach and by minute measurements and precise positioning of the patient. Multiple narrow beams then deliver a very high dose of radiation. An advantage of this method is that no surgical incision is needed. Disadvantages include the lag time between treatment and the desired result as well as the potential for developing radiation necrosis (AANN, 2016).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chemotherapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Chemotherapy may be used in conjunction with radiation therapy, or as the sole therapy, with the goal of increasing survival time. The greatest challenge in chemotherapy of brain tumors is that the blood&#x2013;brain barrier prevents drugs from getting to the tumor in effective doses without causing systemic toxicity (AANN, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Malignant glioma is usually treated with 6 weeks of oral temozolomide during radiation therapy, followed by 6 to 12 months of oral temozolomide. Low-grade gliomas may be treated with 6 months of oral temozolomide alone. Temozolomide is an oral chemotherapy that crosses the blood&#x2013;brain barrier (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">McFaline-Figueroa &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>). Several other chemotherapy agents are used alone or in combination depending on the type of tumor.</p>
<p class="indent">Autologous bone marrow transplantation is used in some patients who will receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy, because it can &#x201C;rescue&#x201D; the patient from the bone marrow toxicity associated with high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. A fraction of the patient&#x2019;s bone marrow is aspirated, usually from the iliac crest, and stored. The patient receives large doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy large numbers of malignant cells. The marrow is then reinfused intravenously after treatment is completed. See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for discussion of bone marrow transplant.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Corticosteroids are useful in relieving headache and alterations in level of consciousness. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are thought to reduce inflammation and edema around tumors (AANN, 2016). Other medications used include osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol and hypertonic saline) to decrease the fluid content of the brain, which leads to a decrease in ICP. Anticonvulsant medications are used to treat and control seizures (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s3084">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The characteristics of headache, when present, should be assessed. Upright positioning and pain medications may be useful in managing pain; nurses should evaluate the effectiveness of pain management interventions (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4508">Ijzerman-Korevaar, Snijers, Saskia, et al., 2018</a>). Even if seizure history is absent, the patient and family should be educated about the possibility of seizure and the need to adhere to prophylactic anticonvulsant medications, if prescribed. The patient with a brain tumor may be at increased risk for aspiration as a result of cranial nerve dysfunction. Medications to alleviate nausea and to prevent vomiting should be considered (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4546">Ijzerman-Korevaar et al., 2018</a>). Preoperatively, the gag reflex and ability to swallow are evaluated. In patients with diminished gag response, care includes educating the patient to direct food and fluids toward the unaffected side, having the patient sit upright to eat, offering a semisoft diet, and having suction readily available. The effects of increased ICP caused by the tumor mass are reviewed in <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>. The nurse performs neurologic checks; monitors vital signs; maintains a neurologic observation record (see <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, <a href="c61-sec02.xhtml#ff61-6">Fig.&#x00A0;61-6</a>); spaces nursing interventions to prevent rapid increase in ICP; and reorients the patient when necessary to person, time, and place. The use of corticosteroids to control headache and neurologic symptoms requires astute nursing assessment and intervention because many adverse effects can occur, including hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and muscle weakness (see <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>, <a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#tt45-3">Table&#x00A0;45-3</a>). Patients with changes in cognition caused by their lesion require frequent reorientation and the use of orienting devices (e.g., personal possessions, photographs, lists, a clock), supervision of and assistance with self-care, and ongoing monitoring and intervention for prevention of injury. Patients with seizures are carefully monitored and protected from injury. Motor function is checked at intervals because specific motor deficits may occur, depending on the tumor&#x2019;s location. When muscle weakness is present, an interprofessional approach, including the nurse and physical and occupational therapists, can be used to preserve muscle strength, promote range of motion, and facilitate independence in self-care. Sensory disturbances are assessed and any area of numbness should be protected from injury. Speech is evaluated, and patients with speech deficits can be educated to use alternative forms of communication. Eye movement and pupillary size and reaction may be affected by cranial nerve involvement. Fatigue is common during therapy; efforts should be made to conserve energy and promote rest.</p>
<p class="indent">The psychosocial effects on family caregivers of a family member who has brain metastases may be significant (<a href="c65-sec13.xhtml#bib4511">Ketcher, Otto, &#x0026; Reblin, 2020</a>). Caregivers should be included in the plan of care.</p>
<p class="indent">The nursing process for patients undergoing neurosurgery is discussed in <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>. The patient&#x2019;s functional abilities should be reassessed postoperatively, because changes can occur.</p>
