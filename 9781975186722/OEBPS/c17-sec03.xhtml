<h4 class="h4" id="s529">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in patients with respiratory conditions. The nurse should educate the patient on the purpose of the studies, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse should note trends in results because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s530">Pulmonary Function Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders to aid diagnosis. They are performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction, response to therapy, and as screening tests in potentially hazardous industries, such as coal mining and those that involve exposure to asbestos and other noxious irritants. PFTs are also used prior to surgery to screen patients who are scheduled for thoracic and upper abdominal surgical procedures, patients who are obese, and symptomatic patients with a history suggesting high risk. Such tests include measurements of lung volumes, ventilatory function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">PFTs generally are performed by a respiratory therapist using a spirometer that has a volume-collecting device attached to a recorder that demonstrates volume and time simultaneously. Several tests are carried out because no single measurement provides a complete picture of pulmonary function. The most frequently used PFTs are described in <a href="#tt17-8">Table&#x00A0;17-8</a>. Technology is available that allows for more complex assessment of pulmonary function. Methods include exercise tidal flow&#x2013;volume loops, negative expiratory pressure, nitric oxide, forced oscillation, and diffusing capacity for helium or carbon monoxide. These assessment methods allow for detailed evaluation of expiratory flow limitations and airway inflammation (<a href="#bib1371">Pagana, Pagana, &#x0026; Pagana, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">PFT results are interpreted on the basis of the degree of deviation from normal, taking into consideration the patient&#x2019;s height, weight, age, gender, and ethnicity. Because there is a wide range of normal values, PFTs may not detect early localized changes. The patient with respiratory symptoms usually undergoes a complete diagnostic evaluation, even if the results of PFTs are &#x201C;normal.&#x201D; Patients with respiratory disorders may be taught how to measure their peak flow rate (which reflects maximal expiratory flow) at home using a spirometer. This allows them to monitor the progress of therapy, to alter medications and other interventions as needed on the basis of caregiver guidelines, and to notify the primary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page487" title="487"></span>provider if there is inadequate response to their own interventions. (Instructions for home care education are described in <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, which discusses asthma.)</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s531">Arterial Blood Gas Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial blood gas (ABG) studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, which reflects ventilation, and the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH, which reflects metabolic states. ABG levels are obtained through an arterial puncture at the radial, brachial, or femoral artery or through an indwelling arterial catheter. Pain (related to nerve injury or noxious stimulation), infection, hematoma, and hemorrhage are potential complications that may be associated with obtaining ABGs (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> for discussion of ABG analysis).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s532">Venous Blood Gas Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Venous blood gas (VBG) studies provide additional data on oxygen delivery and consumption. VBG levels reflect the balance between the amount of oxygen used by tissues and organs and the amount of oxygen returning to the right side of the heart in the blood. VBG levels can be obtained by drawing blood from the venous circulation; this test is performed to provide an estimation of this balance when the ability to draw ABGs is not feasible. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (S<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub>) levels, the most accurate indicator of this balance, can be obtained only from blood samples drawn from a pulmonary artery catheter. However, central venous oxygen saturation (Sc<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub>) levels, which are measured using blood drawn from a central venous catheter placed in the superior vena cava, closely approximate S<img class="m" src="images/vbar.jpg" alt=""/>O<sub>2</sub> levels and are, therefore, useful as an alternative measure in patients without pulmonary artery catheters (<a href="#bib1371">Morton, Reck, &#x0026; Headly, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s533">Pulse Oximetry</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pulse oximetry, or SpO<sub>2</sub>, is a noninvasive method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SaO<sub>2</sub>). Although pulse oximetry does not replace blood gas analysis, it is an effective tool to monitor for changes in SaO<sub>2</sub> and can easily be used in the home and various health care settings.</p>
<p class="indent">A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip (<a href="#ff17-13">Fig.&#x00A0;17-13</a>), forehead, earlobe, or bridge of the nose. The sensor detects changes in oxygen saturation levels by monitoring light signals generated by the oximeter and reflected by blood pulsing through the tissue at the probe. Normal SpO<sub>2</sub> values are more than 95%. Values less than 90% indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, in which case further evaluation is needed. Advantages of pulse oximetry include the ability to obtain rapid results and continuous data using a noninvasive technique. Limitations of pulse oximetry include its inability to detect significant hyperoxemia (excess levels of oxygen), and to measure PaO<sub>2</sub> and ventilation. In order to ensure accurate readings, the nurse should verify correct placement of the probe and decrease or eliminate excess motion (e.g., from patient shivering or movement of the extremity). Readings are unreliable in settings of hypothermia, hemodynamic instability, or low perfusion states (e.g., shock, vasoconstriction, or decreased perfusion of the limb), and when a patient has dark skin or is wearing nail polish. In these situations, analysis of ABGs should be conducted, and when hyperoxemia is suspected, analysis of PaO<sub>2</sub> or PaCO<sub>2</sub> is required (<a href="#bib1371">Mechem, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s534">End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide</h5>
<p class="nonindent">End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring is a noninvasive method of monitoring partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) at end exhalation. ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is considered to be a reliable tool for detecting and monitoring life-threatening conditions because it provides immediate information about ventilation, perfusion, and metabolism by determining the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. Changes in ETCO<sub>2</sub> and the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at the end of each breath can help to diagnose or indicate the severity of a disease or the outcome of a treatment. It is now part of the standard of care for all patients receiving general anesthesia, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page488" title="488"></span>procedural sedation and/or analgesia, and is frequently part of routine monitoring in the prehospital and acute care settings (<a href="#bib1371">Krauss, Falk, &#x0026; Ladde, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The application of ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring can indicate early respiratory depression and impaired airway function sooner than other devices, helping nurses to detect potential complications earlier (<a href="#bib1352">Aminiahidashti, Shafiee, Kiasari, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Data are reported as a number (capnometry) or as a number and a waveform (capnography). Capnography uses infrared technology to obtain results and monitors four phases of the respiratory cycle to depict the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of each phase.</p>
<p class="indent">A capnometry device, such as the colorimetric ETCO<sub>2</sub> detector, is a portable device which contains litmus paper that changes color when exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>. An improper ET intubation, for instance with esophageal intubation, will not result in CO<sub>2</sub> exchange and thus the color of the litmus paper will not change (<a href="#bib1356">Krauss et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is the most reliable indicator that an ET tube is placed in the trachea during intubation (<a href="#bib1356">Krauss et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Some additional indications for ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring include continuous monitoring of ET tube placement during patient transport, confirming return of spontaneous circulation with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, determining a prognosis in patients with trauma, and as an early indicator of respiratory compromise (<a href="#bib1352">Aminiahidashti et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1356">Krauss et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1371">Smallwood &#x0026; Walsh, 2017</a>). The clinician should use caution when interpreting results in patients who are mechanically ventilated with a bag or mask ventilation device, or who have received sodium bicarbonate, or who have ingested carbonated beverages or antacids, as any of these can result in false-positive results (<a href="#bib1352">Aminiahidashti et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s535">Cultures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Throat, nasal, and nasopharyngeal cultures can identify pathogens responsible for respiratory infections, such as pharyngitis. Throat cultures are performed in adults with severe or ongoing sore throats accompanied by fever and lymph node enlargement and are most useful in detecting streptococcal infection. Rapid strep tests are now available that can provide results within 15 minutes, often replacing the need for throat cultures. Other sources of infection, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or <em>Influenza,</em> are detected via nasal or nasopharyngeal cultures. Ideally, all cultures should be obtained prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Results usually take between 48 and 72 hours, with preliminary reports available usually within 24 hours. Cultures may be repeated to assess a patient&#x2019;s response to therapy (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s536">Sputum Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present. Periodic sputum examinations may be necessary for patients receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive medications for prolonged periods because these agents are associated with opportunistic infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Sputum samples ideally are obtained early in the morning before the patient has had anything to eat or drink. The patient is instructed to clear the nose and the throat and rinse the mouth to decrease contamination of the sputum and not to simply spit saliva into the container. Rather, after taking a few deep breaths, the patient coughs deeply and expectorates sputum from the lungs into a sterile container.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient cannot expel an adequate sputum sample following the above techniques, coughing can be induced by administering an aerosolized hypertonic solution via a nebulizer. Other methods of collecting sputum specimens include endotracheal or transtracheal aspiration or bronchoscopic removal. The nurse should label the specimen and send it to the laboratory as soon as possible to avoid contamination.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s537">Imaging Studies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Imaging studies, including x-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radioisotope or nuclear scanning may be part of any diagnostic workup, ranging from a determination of the extent of infection in sinusitis to tumor growth in cancer.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Chest X-Ray</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Normal pulmonary tissue is radiolucent because it consists mostly of air and gases; therefore, densities produced by fluid, tumors, foreign bodies, and other pathologic conditions can be detected by x-ray examination. In the absence of symptoms, a chest x-ray may reveal an extensive pathologic process in the lungs. The routine chest x-ray consists of two views: the posteroanterior projection and the lateral projection. Chest x-rays are usually obtained after full inspiration because the lungs are best visualized when they are well aerated. In addition, the diaphragm is at its lowest level and the largest expanse of lung is visible. Patients, therefore, need to be able to take a deep breath and hold it without discomfort. Chest x-rays are contraindicated in pregnant women.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should notify the patient that chest x-rays do not require fasting, nor typically cause pain. However, in order to best visualize the lungs, the patient must be able to take a deep breath and hold it without discomfort, while the technician takes the images. The patient will be positioned in a standing, sitting, or recumbent position, in order to obtain the appropriate view of the chest (posterior&#x2013;anterior, lateral, oblique, or decubitus position). The patient will be asked to wear a gown, remove metal objects from the chest, such as necklaces, and may be given a lead shield to minimize radiation exposure to the thyroid gland, ovaries, or testicles (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Computed Tomography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A CT of the chest is an imaging method in which the lungs, mediastinum, and vascular structures within the chest are scanned in successive layers by a narrow-beam x-ray. The images produced provide a cross-sectional view of the chest. Whereas a chest x-ray shows major contrasts between body densities such as bone, soft tissue, and air, a CT scan can distinguish fine tissue density. A CT scan may be used to define pulmonary nodules and small tumors adjacent to pleural surfaces that are not visible on routine chest x-rays and to demonstrate mediastinal abnormalities and hilar adenopathy, which are difficult to visualize with other techniques. Contrast agents are useful when evaluating the mediastinum and its contents, particularly its vasculature. CT with contrast <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page489" title="489"></span>agent is not suitable for patients with compromised kidney function, or those with an allergy to iodine dye or shellfish, or who are pregnant, claustrophobic, or have severe obesity. Patients taking metformin should withhold the dose the day of the test in order to prevent lactic acidosis from developing (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib1371">Thompson &#x0026; Kabrhel, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Advancements in CT scanning technology, referred to as multidetection, spiral, or helical CT, enable the chest to be scanned quickly while generating an extensive number of images that can generate a three-dimensional analysis (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should inform patients preparing for CT scans that they will be required to remain supine and still for a short period, typically less than 30 minutes, while a body scanner surrounds them and takes multiple images. Patients typically do not experience claustrophobia during CT scanning but can be given antianxiety medications preprocedure if this is a concern. If contrast agent is required, patients will need to stay <em>nil per os</em> (NPO) for 4 hours prior to the examination. In this case, the nurse should also assess for allergies to iodine or shellfish (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Vital signs should be monitored and documented before, during, and after the scan especially if sedation or analgesia is administered.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pulmonary Angiography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary angiography is used to investigate congenital abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular tree, and less frequently PE, when less invasive tests are inconclusive. This study has primarily been replaced by CT scan of the chest. To visualize the pulmonary vessels, a radiopaque agent is injected through a catheter, which has been initially inserted into a vein (e.g., jugular, subclavian, brachial, or femoral vein) and then threaded into the pulmonary artery. Contraindications include allergy to the radiopaque agent, pregnancy, and bleeding abnormalities, whereas potential complications include acute kidney injury, acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and bleeding (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) combines pulmonary angiography and CT scan imaging. CTPA images the pulmonary arteries and is used primarily if treatment is required for a PE. This procedure typically takes no longer than 30 minutes to complete (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The patient lies in a supine position on an x-ray table. A catheter is placed in the femoral vein, advanced into the inferior vena cava and into the pulmonary artery. Contrast agent and fluoroscopy are utilized for visualization of the pulmonary vasculature when CTPA is performed. The same contraindications for CT with contrast agent apply to CTPA (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib1371">Thompson &#x0026; Kabrhel, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to the angiography, the nurse should verify that informed consent has been obtained; assess for known allergies that may suggest allergies to radiopaque agent (e.g., iodine and shellfish); assess anticoagulation status and renal function; ensure that the patient has not eaten or had anything to drink preprocedurally as prescribed (normally for 4 hours); and administer preprocedure medications that may include antianxiety medications, secretion-reducing agents, and antihistamines (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The nurse should instruct patients that they may experience a warm flushing sensation or chest pain during the injection of the dye. If an arterial puncture is necessary, the affected extremity will need to be immobilized for a certain amount of time depending on the size of the sheath used and the type of arterial closure device employed. Introduction of the catheter into the right ventricle may trigger ventricular irritability. Therefore, during and after the procedure, the patient should be monitored for cardiac arrhythmias such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Following the procedure, the nurse should closely monitor vital signs, level of consciousness, oxygen saturation, and the vascular access site for bleeding or hematoma, and perform frequent assessment of neurovascular status. It may be indicated to apply cold compresses to the puncture site to decrease swelling (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h6>
<p class="nonindent">MRI is similar to a CT scan except that magnetic fields and radiofrequency signals are used instead of radiation. MRI is able to better distinguish between normal and abnormal tissues than CT and, therefore, yields a much more detailed diagnostic image. MRI is used to characterize pulmonary nodules; to help stage bronchogenic carcinoma (assessment of chest wall invasion); and to evaluate inflammatory activity in interstitial lung disease, acute PE, and chronic thrombolytic pulmonary hypertension. Contraindications for MRI include severe obesity, claustrophobia, confusion and agitation, and having implanted metal or metal support devices that are considered unsafe (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Various labels and icons are used to indicate whether a medical device is safe or unsafe for use during MRI. Recent improvements in technology have contributed to the design of certain medical devices, such as infusion pumps and ventilators, deemed safe for the MRI room. The nurse should consult with specially trained MRI personnel to clarify the safety of various devices (<a href="#bib1371">Wells &#x0026; Murphy, 2014</a>). Gadolinium-based contrast agents used during MRI may potentially lead to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with reduced kidney function. Therefore, additional kidney function testing may be necessary, especially in adults older than 60 years of age (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients scheduled for MRI should be instructed to remove all metal items such as hearing aids, hair clips, and medication patches with metallic foil components (e.g., nicotine patches). Prior to the MRI, the nurse should assess for the presence of implanted metal devices, such as aneurysm clips or a cardiac implantable electronic device. Patients with any type of cardiac implantable electronic device need to be screened to determine if they can safely undergo MRI (<a href="#bib1354">Indik, Gimbel, Abe, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse should inform patients preparing for MRI that they will need to lie flat and remain still for between 30 and 90 minutes, while the table that they are on moves into a large tubular magnet. Patients should be notified that they will hear a loud humming or thumping noise. Earplugs are typically offered to patients to minimize this noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff via a microphone and earphones. The nurse should clarify with the primary provider or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page490" title="490"></span>the technologist if the prescribed test requires the use of a contrast agent or if the patient should remain NPO pre-examination. Patients who experience claustrophobia should be offered antianxiety medications preprocedure or be scheduled at a facility that uses an open MRI system (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluoroscopic Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluoroscopy, which allows live x-ray images to be generated via a camera to a video screen, is used to assist with invasive procedures, such as a chest needle biopsy or transbronchial biopsy, that are performed to identify lesions. It also may be used to study the movement of the chest wall, mediastinum, heart, and diaphragm; to detect diaphragm paralysis; and to locate lung masses. The specific procedure performed under fluoroscopy will guide those respective nursing interventions (e.g., see nursing interventions described in the Lung Biopsy Procedures section).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radioisotope Diagnostic Procedures (Lung Scans)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several types of lung scans&#x2014;V./Q. scan, gallium scan, and positron emission tomography (PET)&#x2014;are performed to assess normal lung functioning, pulmonary vascular supply, and gas exchange. Pregnancy is a contraindication for these scans.</p>
<p class="indent">A V./Q. lung scan is performed by injecting a radioactive agent into a peripheral vein and then obtaining a scan of the chest to detect radiation. The isotope particles pass through the right side of the heart and are distributed into the lungs in proportion to the regional blood flow, making it possible to trace and measure blood perfusion through the lung. This procedure is used clinically to measure the integrity of the pulmonary vessels relative to blood flow and to evaluate blood flow abnormalities, as seen in PE. The imaging time is 20 to 40 minutes, during which the patient lies under the camera with a mask fitted over the nose and the mouth. This is followed by the ventilation component of the scan. The patient takes a deep breath of a mixture of oxygen and radioactive gas, which diffuses throughout the lungs. A scan is performed to detect ventilation abnormalities in patients who have regional differences in ventilation. It may be helpful in the diagnosis of bronchitis, asthma, inflammatory fibrosis, pneumonia, emphysema, and lung cancer. Ventilation without perfusion is seen with PE.</p>
<p class="indent">A gallium scan is a radioisotope lung scan used to detect inflammatory conditions, abscesses, adhesions, and the presence, location, and size of tumors. It is used to stage bronchogenic cancer and to document tumor regression after chemotherapy or radiation. Gallium is injected intravenously, and scans are obtained at intervals (e.g., 6, 24, and 48 hours) to evaluate gallium uptake by the pulmonary tissues.</p>
<p class="indent">PET is a radioisotope study with advanced diagnostic capabilities that is used to evaluate lung nodules for malignancy. PET can detect and display metabolic changes in tissue, distinguish normal tissue from diseased tissue (such as in cancer), differentiate viable from dead or dying tissue, and show regional blood flow. PET is more accurate in detecting malignancies than CT and has equivalent accuracy in detecting malignant nodules when compared with invasive procedures such as thoracoscopy. Images from PET scans are now being superimposed on CT and MRI images to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">For each of these nuclear scans, the nurse should educate the patient on what to expect. Intravenous access is required. Chest x-ray should be performed prior to a V./Q. scan. Patients should be told that V./Q. and gallium scans require only a small amount of radioisotopes; therefore, radiation safety measures are not indicated. Normally, the patient may eat or drink prior to V./Q. or gallium scans. Multiple factors can hinder the uptake of radioactive agents used for a PET scan. The nurse should instruct the patient to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco for 24 hours prior to the PET scan and abstain from food and fluids for 4 hours prior to the scan. Accurate results depend on an empty bladder; thus, a Foley catheter may be indicated. The nurse should encourage fluid intake postprocedure to facilitate the elimination of radioisotopes in the urine (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s538">Endoscopic Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Endoscopic procedures include bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, and thoracentesis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bronchoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bronchoscopy:&lt;/b&gt; direct examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi using an endoscope">Bronchoscopy</button></strong> is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi through either a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or a rigid bronchoscope (<a href="#ff17-14">Fig.&#x00A0;17-14</a>). The fiberoptic scope is used more frequently in current practice.</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">The purposes of diagnostic bronchoscopy are (1) to visualize tissues and determine the nature, location, and extent of the pathologic process; (2) to collect secretions for analysis and to obtain a tissue sample for diagnosis; (3) to determine whether a tumor can be resected surgically; and (4) to diagnose sources of hemoptysis.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff17-14">

<img src="images/ff17-14.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff17-14.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;17-14 &#x2022;</span> Endoscopic bronchoscopy permits visualization of bronchial structures. The bronchoscope is advanced into bronchial structures orally. Bronchoscopy permits the clinician to not only diagnose but also treat various lung problems.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 490</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page491" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="491">p. 491</span></div>
<p class="indent">Therapeutic bronchoscopy is used to (1) remove foreign bodies or secretions from the tracheobronchial tree, (2) control bleeding, (3) treat postoperative atelectasis, (4) destroy and excise lesions, and (5) provide brachytherapy (endobronchial radiation therapy). It has also been used to insert stents to relieve airway obstruction that is caused by tumors or miscellaneous benign conditions or that occurs as a complication of lung transplantation.</p>
<p class="indent">The fiberoptic bronchoscope is a thin, flexible bronchoscope that can be directed into the segmental bronchi. Because of its small size, its flexibility, and its excellent optical system, it allows increased visualization of the peripheral airways and is ideal for diagnosing pulmonary lesions. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy allows biopsy of previously inaccessible tumors and can be performed at the bedside. It also can be performed through ET or tracheostomy tubes of patients on ventilators. Cytologic examinations can be performed without surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="indent">The rigid bronchoscope is a hollow metal tube with a light at its end. It is used mainly for removing foreign substances, investigating the source of massive hemoptysis, or performing endobronchial surgical procedures. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room, not at the bedside.</p>
<p class="indent">Possible complications of bronchoscopy include a reaction to the local anesthetic, oversedation, prolonged fever, infection, aspiration, vasovagal response, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypoxemia, pneumothorax, and bleeding (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before the procedure, the nurse should verify that informed consent has been obtained. Food and fluids are withheld for 4 to 8 hours before the test to reduce the risk of aspiration when the cough reflex is blocked by anesthesia. The patient must remove dentures and other oral prostheses. The nurse explains the procedure to the patient to reduce fear and decrease anxiety and then administers preoperative medications (usually atropine and a sedative or opioid) as prescribed to inhibit vagal stimulation (thereby guarding against bradycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension), suppress the cough reflex, sedate the patient, and relieve anxiety.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Sedation given to patients with respiratory insufficiency may precipitate respiratory arrest.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The examination is usually performed under local anesthesia or moderate sedation; however, general anesthesia may be used for rigid bronchoscopy. A topical anesthetic such as lidocaine is normally sprayed on the pharynx or dropped on the epiglottis and vocal cords and into the trachea to suppress the cough reflex and minimize discomfort.</p>
<p class="indent">After the procedure, the patient must take nothing by mouth until the cough reflex returns, because the preoperative sedation and local anesthesia impair the protective laryngeal reflex and swallowing. Once the patient demonstrates a cough reflex, the nurse may offer ice chips and eventually fluids. In the older adult patient, the nurse assesses for confusion and lethargy, which may be owing to the large doses of lidocaine given during the procedure. The nurse also monitors the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status and observes for hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Any abnormality is reported promptly. A small amount of blood-tinged sputum and fever may be expected within the first 24 hours (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The patient is not discharged from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) until adequate cough reflex and respiratory status are present. The nurse instructs the patient and caregivers to report any shortness of breath or bleeding immediately.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff17-15">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff17-15.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff17-15.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;17-15 &#x2022;</span> Endoscopic thoracoscopy. Like bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy uses fiberoptic instruments and video cameras for visualizing thoracic structures. Unlike bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy usually requires the surgeon to make a small incision before inserting the endoscope. A combined diagnostic&#x2013;treatment procedure, thoracoscopy includes excising tissue for biopsy.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Thoracoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Thoracoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural cavity is examined with an endoscope and fluid and tissues can be obtained for analysis (<a href="#ff17-15">Fig.&#x00A0;17-15</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">This procedure is performed in the operating room, normally under anesthesia. Small incisions are made into the pleural cavity in an intercostal space at the location indicated by clinical and diagnostic findings. The fiberoptic mediastinoscope is inserted into the pleural cavity, any fluid present is aspirated, and the pleural cavity is inspected through the instrument. After the procedure, a chest tube may be inserted to facilitate re-expansion of the lung.</p>
<p class="indent">Thoracoscopy is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of pleural effusions, pleural disease, and tumor staging. Biopsies of the lesions and resection of tissues can be performed under visualization for diagnosis.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 491</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page492" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="492">p. 492</span></div>
<p class="indent">Thoracoscopic procedures have expanded with the availability of video monitoring, which permits improved visualization of the lung. Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of empyema, pleural effusion, pulmonary and pleural masses, and pneumothorax. Although VATS does not replace the need for thoracotomy in the treatment of some lung cancers, its use continues to grow, because it is less invasive than open surgical procedures, and hospitalization and recovery are shorter.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse should follow routine preoperative practices, such as ensuring that informed consent is obtained and that the patient remains NPO prior to the procedure. Postoperatively, the nurse should monitor vital signs, pain level, and respiratory status, and should look for signs of bleeding and infection at the incisional site. Shortness of breath may indicate a pneumothorax and should be reported immediately. If a chest tube was inserted during the procedure, monitoring of the chest drainage system and chest tube insertion site is essential (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Thoracentesis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In some respiratory disorders, pleural fluid may accumulate. Thoracentesis (aspiration of fluid and air from the pleural space) is performed for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. Purposes of the procedure include removal of fluid and, very rarely, air from the pleural cavity; aspiration of pleural fluid for analysis; pleural biopsy; and instillation of medication into the pleural space. Studies of pleural fluid include Gram stain culture and sensitivity, acid-fast staining and culture, differential cell count, cytology, pH, total protein, lactic dehydrogenase, glucose, amylase, triglycerides, and cancer markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box492"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for assisting with a thoracentesis, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s539">Biopsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Biopsy&#x2014;the excision of a small amount of tissue&#x2014;may be performed to permit examination of cells from the upper and lower respiratory structures and adjacent lymph nodes. Local, topical, or moderate sedation, or general anesthesia, may be given, depending on the site and the procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pleural Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pleural biopsy is accomplished by needle biopsy of the pleura, thoracoscopy, or pleuroscopy, a visual exploration through a fiberoptic pleuroscope inserted into the pleural space or through a thoracotomy. Pleural biopsy is performed when there is pleural exudate of undetermined origin or when there is a need to culture or stain the tissue to identify tuberculosis or fungi.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lung Biopsy Procedures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Lung biopsy is performed to obtain tissue for examination when other diagnostic testing indicates potential interstitial lung disease, such as cancer, infection, or sarcoidosis. Several nonsurgical lung biopsy techniques are used because they yield accurate information with low morbidity: transbronchial brushing or needle aspiration, transbronchial lung biopsy, and percutaneous (through-the-skin) needle biopsy. Possible complications for all methods include pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, and empyema (<a href="#bib1347">Pagana et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">In transbronchial brushing, a fiberoptic bronchoscope is introduced into the bronchus under fluoroscopy. A small brush attached to the end of a flexible wire is inserted through the bronchoscope. Under direct visualization, the area under suspicion is brushed back and forth, causing cells to slough off and adhere to the brush. The catheter port of the bronchoscope may be used to irrigate the lung tissue with saline solution to secure material for additional studies. The brush is removed from the bronchoscope, and a slide is made for examination under the microscope. The brush may be cut off and sent to the pathology laboratory for analysis. This procedure is especially useful in the immunologically compromised patient.</p>
<p class="indent">In transbronchial needle aspiration, a catheter with a needle is inserted into the tissue through the bronchoscope and aspirated, whereas in transbronchial lung biopsy, biting or cutting forceps are introduced by a fiberoptic bronchoscope to excise the tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">In percutaneous needle biopsy, a cutting needle or a spinal-type needle is used to obtain a tissue specimen for histologic study under fluoroscopic or CT guidance. Analgesia may be given before the procedure. The skin over the biopsy site is cleansed and anesthetized and a small incision is made. The biopsy needle is inserted through the incision into the pleura with the patient holding their breath in midexpiration. The surgeon guides the needle into the periphery of the lesion and obtains a tissue sample from the mass.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">After the procedure, recovery and home care are similar to those for bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy. Nursing care involves monitoring the patient for complications such as shortness of breath, bleeding, or infection. In preparation for discharge, the patient and the family are instructed to report pain, shortness of breath, visible bleeding, redness of the biopsy site, or purulent drainage (pus) to the primary provider immediately. Patients who have undergone biopsy are often anxious because of the need for the biopsy and the potential findings; the nurse must consider this in providing postbiopsy care and patient education.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lymph Node Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The scalene lymph nodes, which are enmeshed in the deep cervical pad of fat overlying the scalenus anterior muscle, drain the lungs and mediastinum and may show histologic changes from intrathoracic disease. If these nodes are palpable on physical examination, a scalene node biopsy may be performed. A biopsy of these nodes may be performed to detect spread of pulmonary disease to the lymph nodes and to establish a diagnosis or prognosis in such diseases as Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoidosis, fungal disease, tuberculosis, and carcinoma.</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">Mediastinoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the mediastinum for exploration and biopsy of mediastinal lymph <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page493" title="493"></span>nodes that drain the lungs; this examination does not require a thoracotomy. Biopsy is usually performed through a suprasternal incision. Mediastinoscopy is carried out to detect mediastinal involvement of pulmonary malignancy and to obtain tissue for diagnostic studies of other conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis).</p>
<p class="indent">An anterior mediastinotomy is thought to provide better exposure and diagnostic possibilities than a mediastinoscopy. An incision is made in the area of the second or third costal cartilage. The mediastinum is explored, and biopsies are performed on any lymph nodes found. Chest tube drainage is required after the procedure. Mediastinotomy is particularly valuable to determine whether a pulmonary lesion is resectable.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Postprocedure care focuses on providing adequate oxygenation, monitoring for bleeding, and providing pain relief. The patient may be discharged a few hours after the chest drainage system is removed. The nurse should instruct the patient and the family about monitoring for changes in respiratory status, taking into consideration the impact of anxiety about the potential findings of the biopsy on their ability to remember those instructions.</p>
