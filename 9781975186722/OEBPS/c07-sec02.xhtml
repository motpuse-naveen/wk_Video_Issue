<h4 class="h4" id="s122">Right of Access to Health Care</h4>
<p class="nonindent">People with disabilities have the right of access to health care that is equal in quality to that of other people. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD, 2006) identifies the rights of people with disabilities to receive the highest standard of health care, without discrimination. More than 30 years after the passage of the ADA, the United States has not ratified the CRPD. Despite the rights identified by the CRPD and the ADA in the United States, people with disabilities continue to experience health disparities (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Kaye, 2019</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib480">McClintock, Kurichi, Barg, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For years, people with disabilities around the world have been discriminated against in employment, public accommodations, and public and private services, including health care (WHO, 2018a). Unmet needs of people with disabilities include but are not limited to medical, dental, and prescription medication needs. The needs of people with disabilities in health care settings present challenges to health care providers: how to communicate effectively if there are communication deficits, how to address the additional physical requirements for mobility, and how to ensure sufficient time to provide assistance with self-care routines during <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page147" title="147"></span>hospitalization. Nurses and other clinicians need to be aware of the specific needs of people with disabilities and to provide appropriate care and services for them. People with disabilities have a legally mandated right to accessible health care facilities for all medical care and screening procedures. Furthermore, they have the right to health care provided by knowledgeable clinicians who are sensitive to the effects of disability on access to health care, including care that addresses their reproductive issues and sexuality. As multiple recent studies have demonstrated, however, improvements are needed to provide women with disabilities with quality care targeting their sexuality and reproductive health care needs (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib467">Hayward, Chen, Forbes, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">LaPierre, Zimmerman, &#x0026; Hall, 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib483">Mitra, Smith, Smeltzer, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib484">Morris, Maragh-Bass, Griffin, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Tarasoff, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Reasonable accommodations are mandated by law and are the financial responsibility of the health care provider or facility. People with disabilities should not be expected to provide their own accommodations (e.g., sign language interpreters, assistants). Family members should not be expected to serve as interpreters because of concern for the patient&#x2019;s privacy and confidentiality and the risk of errors in interpreting information by either the patient or the health care provider. <a href="#ct7-4">Chart&#x00A0;7-4</a> identifies strategies to communicate effectively with people with disabilities. <a href="#ff7-1">Figures 7-1A,B</a> and <a href="#ff7-2">7-2A,B</a> illustrate inappropriate and appropriate communication, respectively, with a person with a disability who uses a wheelchair or is seated.</p>

<p class="indent">In response to continued accessibility issues, the U.S. Surgeon General issued <em>Call to Action to Improve the Health and Wellness of Persons with Disabilities</em> (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Smeltzer, 2007</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib443">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2005</a>). This report recognized that all people with disabilities need to have access to comprehensive health care so that they are able to have full, engaged, and productive lives in their own communities. Among strategies to accomplish this, the call to action stipulated that health care professionals need to become knowledgeable about disability. It further recommended that schools educating health care professionals educate about disability and address the need for increased availability of methods to screen, diagnose, and treat the whole person with a disability with dignity.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Interacting and Communicating with People Who Have Disabilities</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients will feel most comfortable receiving health care if you consider the following suggestions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not be afraid to make a mistake when interacting and communicating with someone with a disability or chronic medical condition. Keep in mind that a person with a disability is a person first and is entitled to the dignity, consideration, respect, and rights you expect for yourself.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Treat adults as adults. Address people with disabilities by their first names only if extending the same familiarity to all others present. Never patronize people by patting them on the head or the shoulder.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Relax. If you do not know what to do, allow the person who has a disability to identify how you may be of assistance and to put you at ease.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you offer assistance and the person declines, do not insist. If your offer is accepted, ask how you can best help, and follow directions. Do not take over.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If someone with a disability is accompanied by another person, address the person with a disability directly rather than speaking through the accompanying companion.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be considerate of the extra time it might take for a person with a disability to get things done or said. Let the person set the pace.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not be embarrassed to use common expressions, such as &#x201C;See you later&#x201D; or &#x201C;Got to be running,&#x201D; that seem to relate to the person&#x2019;s disability.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use people-first language: Refer to &#x201C;a person with a disability&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;a disabled person&#x201D; and avoid referring to people by the disability or disorder they have (e.g., &#x201C;the diabetic&#x201D;).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Mobility Limitations</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not make assumptions about what a person can and cannot do.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not push a person&#x2019;s wheelchair or grab the arm of someone walking with difficulty without first asking whether you can be of assistance and how you can assist. Personal space includes a person&#x2019;s wheelchair, scooter, crutches, walker, cane, or other mobility aid.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Never move someone&#x2019;s wheelchair, scooter, crutches, walker, cane, or other mobility aid without permission.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When speaking for more than a few minutes to a person who is seated in a wheelchair, try to find a seat for yourself so that the two of you are at eye level (see <a href="#ff7-2">Fig.&#x00A0;7-2</a>A,B).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When giving directions to people with mobility limitations, consider distance, weather conditions, and physical obstacles such as stairs, curbs, and steep hills.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Shake hands when introduced to a person with a disability. People who have limited hand use or who wear an artificial limb do shake hands.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Vision Loss (Low Vision and Blindness)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify yourself when you approach a person who has low vision or blindness. If a new person approaches, introduce them.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Touch the person&#x2019;s arm lightly when you speak so that they know to whom you are speaking before you begin.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Face the person and speak directly to them. Use a normal tone of voice.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not leave without saying that you are leaving.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you are offering directions, be as specific as possible and point out obstacles in the path of travel. Use specifics such as &#x201C;Left about 20 feet&#x201D; or &#x201C;Right 2 yards.&#x201D; Use clock cues, such as &#x201C;The door is at 10 o&#x2019;clock.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When you offer to assist someone with vision loss, allow the person to take your arm. This will help you guide rather than propel or lead the person. When offering seating, place the person&#x2019;s hand on the back or the arm of the seat.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Alert people with low vision or blindness to posted information.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Never pet or otherwise distract a canine companion or service animal unless the owner has given you permission.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Hearing Loss (Hard of Hearing, Deaf, Deaf&#x2013;Blind)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ask the person how they prefer to communicate.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you are speaking through a sign language interpreter, remember that the interpreter may lag a few words behind&#x2014;especially if there are names or technical terms to be finger spelled&#x2014;so pause occasionally to allow the interpreter time to translate completely and accurately.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Talk directly to the person who has hearing loss, not to the interpreter. However, although it may seem awkward to you, the person who has hearing loss will look at the interpreter and may not make eye contact with you during the conversation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Before you start to speak, make sure that you have the attention of the person you are addressing. A wave, a light touch on the arm or the shoulder, or other visual or tactile signals are appropriate ways of getting the person&#x2019;s attention.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Speak in a clear, expressive manner. Do not over enunciate or exaggerate words. Unless you are specifically requested to do so, do not raise your voice. Speak in a normal tone; do not shout.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>To facilitate lip reading, face the person and keep your hands and other objects away from your mouth. Maintain eye contact. Do not turn your back or walk around while talking. If you look away, the person might assume that the conversation is over.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid talking while you are writing a message for someone with hearing loss, because the person cannot read your note and your lips at the same time.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Try to eliminate background noise.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encourage feedback to assess clear understanding.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you do not understand something that is said, ask the person to repeat it or to write it down. The goal is communication; do not pretend to understand if you do not.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If you know any sign language, try using it. It may help you communicate, and it will at least demonstrate your interest in communicating and your willingness to try.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Speech Disabilities or Speech Difficulties</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Talk to people with speech disabilities as you would talk to anyone else.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be friendly; start up a conversation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be patient; it may take the person a while to answer. Allow extra time for communication. Do not speak for the person.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Give the person your undivided attention.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ask the person for help in communicating with them. If the person uses a communication device such as a manual or electronic communication board, ask the person the best way to use it.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Speak in your regular tone of voice.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Tell the person if you do not understand what they are trying to say. Ask the person to repeat the message, spell it, tell you in a different way, or write it down. Use hand gestures and notes.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Repeat what you understand. The person&#x2019;s reactions will clue you in and guide you to understanding.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" title="149"></span><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>To obtain information quickly, ask short questions that require brief answers or a head nod. Avoid insulting the person&#x2019;s intelligence with oversimplification.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep your manner encouraging rather than correcting.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Intellectual/Cognitive Disabilities</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Treat adults with intellectual/cognitive disabilities as adults.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be alert to the person&#x2019;s responses so that you can adjust your method of communication as necessary. For example, some people may benefit from simple, direct sentences or from supplementary visual forms of communication, such as gestures, diagrams, or demonstrations.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use concrete rather than abstract language. Be specific, without being too simplistic. When possible, use words that relate to things you both can see. Avoid using directional terms such as right, left, east, or west.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be prepared to give the person the same information more than once in different ways.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>When asking questions, phrase them to elicit accurate information. People with intellectual/cognitive disabilities may be eager to please and may tell you what they think you want to hear. Verify responses by repeating the question in a different way.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Give exact instructions. For example, &#x201C;Be back for lab work at 4:30,&#x201D; not &#x201C;Be back in 15 min.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid giving too many directions at one time, which may be confusing.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep in mind that the person may prefer information provided in written or verbal form. Ask the person how you can best relay the information.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Using humor is fine, but do not interpret a lack of response as rudeness. Some people may not grasp subtleties of language.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Know that people with brain injuries may have short-term memory deficits and may repeat themselves or require information to be repeated.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that people with auditory perceptual problems may need to have directions repeated and may take notes to help them remember directions or the sequence of tasks. They may benefit from watching a task demonstrated.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Understand that people with perceptual or &#x201C;sensory overload&#x201D; problems may become disoriented or confused if there is too much to absorb at once. Provide information gradually and clearly. Reduce background noise if possible.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Repeat information using different wording or a different communication approach if necessary. Allow time for the information to be fully understood.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not pretend to understand if you do not. Ask the person to repeat what was said. Be patient, flexible, and supportive.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that some people who have an intellectual disability are easily distracted. Try not to interpret distraction as rudeness.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not expect all people to be able to read well. Some people may not read at all.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Psychiatric-Mental Health Disabilities</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Speak directly to the person. Use clear, simple communication.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Offer to shake hands when introduced. Use the same good manners in interacting with a person who has a psychiatric-mental health disability that you would with anyone else.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Make eye contact and be aware of your own body language. Like others, people with psychiatric-mental health disabilities will sense your discomfort.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Listen attentively, and wait for the person to finish speaking. If needed, clarify what the person has said. Never pretend to understand.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Treat adults as adults. Do not patronize, condescend, or threaten. Do not make decisions for the person or assume that you know the person&#x2019;s preferences.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not give unsolicited advice or assistance. Do not panic or summon an ambulance or the police if a person appears to be experiencing a mental health crisis. Calmly ask the person how you can help.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not blame the person. A person with a psychiatric disability has a complex, biomedical condition that is sometimes difficult to control. The person cannot just &#x201C;shape up.&#x201D; It is rude, insensitive, and ineffective to tell or expect a person to do so.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Question the accuracy of media stereotypes of psychiatric-mental health disabilities: Movies and media often sensationalize psychiatric-mental health disabilities. Most people never experience symptoms that include violent behavior.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Relax. Be yourself. Do not be embarrassed if you happen to use common expressions that seem to relate to a psychiatric-mental health disability.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that beneath the symptoms and behaviors of psychiatric disabilities is a person who has many of the same wants, needs, dreams, and desires as anyone else. If you are afraid, learn more about psychiatric-mental health disabilities.</p>

<p class="indent">Health care in people with disabilities received further national attention through specific national objectives in <em>Healthy People 2020</em> (HHS, 2010). The midcourse review of those objectives indicated some improvement in health and health-related outcomes for people with disabilities (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib496">Sinclair, Fox, Jonas, et al., 2018</a>). For example, the midcourse review revealed that national goals for health were improved or exceeded for 44.6% of objectives for people without disabilities compared to only 30.6% for people with disabilities (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib439">National Center for Health Statistics, 2016</a>). These results indicate that work toward achieving equity in health care for individuals with disability is still needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirty years after the passage of the ADA in 1990, significant health status and health care disparities persist for people with disabilities. Furthermore, progress has been slow in ensuring that health care professionals receive adequate education about providing quality health care to them.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s123">Barriers to Health Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">People with disabilities often encounter barriers in their daily lives and in their efforts to obtain health care, health promotion, and preventive health screening. For example, structural barriers such as stairs, lack of ramps, and narrow doorways may prevent people who are wheelchair users from entering facilities. Other structural barriers include restroom <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" title="150"></span>facilities that lack grab bars or sufficiently large restroom stalls, elevated toilet seats, and accessible sinks (CDC, 2018; WHO, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">Structural barriers to accessibility are most easily identified and eliminated. Other less visible barriers include negative and stereotypic attitudes (e.g., believing that all people with disabilities have a poor quality of life and are dependent and nonproductive) on the part of the public. Health care providers with similar negative attitudes make it difficult for people with disabilities to obtain health care equal in quality to that of people without disabilities. The Rehabilitation Act and the ADA were passed more than 46 and 30 years ago, respectively, to ensure equal access to people with disabilities; however, people with disabilities continue to encounter and report multiple barriers to health care facilities and providers. This legislation, the U.S. Surgeon General&#x2019;s call to action (HHS, 2005) and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 are examples of efforts to eliminate barriers encountered by people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">People with disabilities have also reported lack of access to information, transportation difficulties, inability to pay because of limited income, difficulty finding a health care provider knowledgeable about their particular disability, previous negative health care encounters, reliance on caregivers, and the demands of coping with the disability itself (HHS, 2005). These issues affect both men and women with severe disabilities; however, women are at higher risk for receiving a lower level of health care than men. Women with disabilities are significantly less likely to receive pelvic examinations than women without disabilities; the more severe the disability, the less frequent the examination. In particular, minority women and older women with disabilities are less likely to have regular pelvic examinations and Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. Reasons given by women for not having regular pelvic examinations are difficulty transferring on to the examination table, belief that they do not need pelvic examinations because of their disability, difficulty in accessing the office or the clinic, and difficulty finding transportation (HHS, 2005). Health care providers often underestimate the effect of disabilities on women&#x2019;s ability to access health care, including health screening and health promotion, and they focus on women&#x2019;s disabilities while ignoring women&#x2019;s general health issues and concerns. Furthermore, women with disabilities have reported lack of knowledge about disability and insensitivity on the part of health care providers.</p>
<p class="indent">Individuals with disabilities living in rural settings also face barriers associated with having fewer resources and less access to care than those living in larger communities or urban settings. Therefore, establishing and maintaining involvement in their community can help ensure that they remain active and connected to others living around them, as described by Thurman, Harrison, and Walker (2019) (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct7-5">Chart&#x00A0;7-5</a>). Additionally, those living in rural areas are less likely to have many types of recommended screenings (Goyat, Vyas, &#x0026; Sambamoorthi, 2016; Maga&#x00F1;a, Parish, Morales, et al., 2016; WHO, 2018a, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Costs of care continue to be a factor in delaying or forgoing health care despite changes brought about by legislation, including the ADA and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (see later discussion in this chapter). Working individuals with disability are two to four times more likely to delay necessary health care than those without disabilities. Lack of transportation and being refused care are also associated with failure to obtain needed health care among those with disabilities. Further, individuals with multiple limitations and more severe disabilities are less likely to obtain or receive health care than those without disabilities and those without multiple limitations or less severe disability (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib438">Na, Hennessy, Boner, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib494">Reichard, Stransky, Phillips, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Race, gender, and type of disability also affect prevalence, health status and receipt of health care and screening. For example, African American women with intellectual disabilities are less likely to receive mammography than Caucasian women with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the persistence of these and other barriers, it is essential that nurses and other health care providers take steps to ensure that clinics, offices, hospitals, and other health care facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. This includes removal of structural barriers by the addition of ramps, designation of accessible parking spaces, and modification of restrooms to make them usable by people with disabilities. Alternative communication methods (e.g., sign language interpreters, teletypewriter devices, assistive listening devices) and types of patient education (e.g., audiotapes, large print, Braille) are essential to provision of appropriate health-related information to people with disabilities. Such accommodations are mandated by the ADA, which requires their provision without cost to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">People with intellectual and developmental disabilities often need assistance in obtaining health care, including preventive health screening. They often lack knowledge about cancer screening, including breast cancer screening. Educational materials and interventions modified to accommodate patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities are needed to enable them to make informed decisions about screening. Major barriers to breast cancer screening by this population of women include fear, anxiety, and embarrassment, primarily due to lack of understanding about cancer and the importance of its early detection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s124">Federal Assistance Programs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lack of financial resources, including health insurance, is an important barrier to health care for people with chronic illness and disabilities. However, several federal assistance programs provide financial assistance for health-related expenses for people with some chronic illnesses, acquired disabling acute and chronic diseases, and childhood disabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Medicare is a federal health insurance program that is available to most people 65 years of age and older, people with permanent kidney injury, and qualified people with disabilities. Title II of the Social Security Disability Insurance program pays benefits to those people who meet medical criteria for disability, who have worked long enough (40 quarters of covered employment) to qualify, and who have paid Social Security taxes. Title II also provides benefits to people disabled since childhood (younger than 22 years), who are dependents of a deceased insured parent or a parent entitled to disability or retirement benefits, and disabled widows or widowers, 50 to 60 years of age, if their deceased spouse was insured under Social Security. Title XVI of the Social Security <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" title="151"></span>Disability Insurance program provides supplemental security income payments to people who are disabled and have limited income and resources.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Thurman, W. A., Harrison, T. C., Walker, V. G., et al. (2019). Pursuing well-being among rural-dwelling adults with disabilities. <em>Qualitative Health Research, 29</em>(12), 1699&#x2013;1710.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The rate of disabilities is higher in rural areas globally than in more urban settings across gender, race, and type of disability or impairment. Individuals with disability who reside in rural communities are at a greater disadvantage for receiving services than those who live in urban settings. Although sociocultural and environmental factors affect the well-being of individuals with disabilities, little is known about the experience of adults with disabilities who live in rural areas. This qualitative study was conducted to explore the experience of living with a disability in rural America with the goal of greater understanding of how disability affects social roles, adaptation to impairments, and use of resources to improve well-being in individuals. The researchers&#x2019; goal was to examine how working-age adults (35&#x2013;70 years of age) with mobility and sensory disabilities living in rural areas of the United States define and pursue well-being.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The researchers used a constructivist grounded theory approach with constant comparison analysis to study the well-being of community-residing adults with disabilities living in rural settings, defined as communities with fewer than 10,000 residents. The study participants were recruited through community organizations, newspaper announcements, word of mouth, and professional networks of the researchers. Twelve individuals who met inclusion criteria, including the ability to understand spoken or written English, participated in up to three one-to-one interviews. The interview questions addressed participants&#x2019; perceptions of how their disability affected their lives over time, activities they enjoyed, qualities of their rural communities, and people who interacted with them regularly. Demographic data (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, length of time they lived in their rural setting, level of education, income, housing, employment status, occupation, age at onset of their disability, and the structure of their family) were collected to describe the sample. The study participants had a variety of mobility and sensory impairments, including osteoarthritis, paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, hearing loss, diabetes, and heart disease. Ten of the participants used some type of assistive device.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Six concepts related to well-being were identified: values, rural attitude, demands, set expectations, strategic participation, and membership. Membership in the rural community, identified as the core category, refers to a feeling of belonging and being part of something greater than one&#x2019;s self. This was sustained by ongoing contributions to the rural community. Establishing and maintaining membership in the community described participants&#x2019; sense of belonging to a group, and they felt that they were regarded as contributing participants in their communities. Membership also provided access to support from other community members when needed. These findings support previous research on rural settings indicating the importance of a sense of belonging to well-being. In the rural setting, social processes are used to mobilize resources needed to overcome functional limitations secondary to disability to establish group membership and create a sense of well-being. Meaningful social relationships contributed to participants&#x2019; well-being, self-confidence, and self-valuing.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The findings indicate the importance of having social support, being a member of a group, and belonging to a network in which there is a reciprocal exchange of support and services for individuals with disabilities from rural communities. Thus, nurses and other health professionals working in rural settings could encourage individuals with disabilities to maintain social relationships, memberships, and participation in meaningful activities. Such participation could promote confidence and a sense of well-being and facilitate access to material and psychological support.</p>

<p class="indent">Medicaid provides home and community-based services to people with disabilities and long-term illnesses to enable them to lead meaningful lives in their families and communities (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Krahn, Walker, &#x0026; Correa-De-Araujo, 2015</a>). The ACA has expanded insurance options for people with disabilities and made these options more affordable. Furthermore, although the ACA stipulates that people with preexisting chronic conditions and disabilities can no longer be dropped by insurance companies and no longer have a lifetime cap on benefits, comparison of pre-ACA and post-ACA access to health care indicates that health disparities based on disability status persist (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Kaye, 2019</a>). Because of differences in states&#x2019; implementation of the ACA, differences in access to health care among people with disability also differ (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib478">Lindner, Rowland, Spurlock, et al., 2018</a>). See later discussion of the ACA in this chapter, and the Resources section at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the availability of these federal programs, people with disabilities often have health-related costs and other expenses related to disability that result in low-income status. Furthermore, people must undergo a disability determination process to establish eligibility for benefits, and the process can be prolonged and cumbersome for those who may need assistance in establishing their eligibility.</p>
