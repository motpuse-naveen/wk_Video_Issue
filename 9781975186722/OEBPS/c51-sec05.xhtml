<p class="nonindent">After menopause, the vaginal mucosa becomes thinner and may atrophy. While vulvovaginal atrophy can occur at any time in a woman&#x2019;s life, it is most common in women who are postmenopausal, with an incidence of nearly 50% (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Naumova &#x0026; Castelo-Branco, 2018</a>). This condition can be complicated by infection from phylogenic bacteria, resulting in atrophic vaginitis (see <a href="c51-sec02.xhtml#tt51-1">Table&#x00A0;51-1</a>). Leukorrhea (vaginal discharge) may cause itching and burning. Management is similar to bacterial vaginosis. Estrogenic hormones, either taken orally or inserted into the vagina in a cream form, can also be effective in restoring the epithelium.</p>
<p class="indent">Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is an uncommon but severe purulent form of vaginal infection that occurs mostly in Caucasian women who are perimenopausal. It results in vaginal inflammation, burning, discharge, and dyspareunia (pain with penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse). Topical anti-inflammatory and antibiotic treatment is usually effective (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Mills, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph1" id="nurse42"><strong>The Patient with a Vulvovaginal Infection</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The woman with vulvovaginal symptoms should be examined as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. She should be instructed not to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;douche:&lt;/b&gt; rinsing the vaginal canal with fluid">douche</button></strong> (rinse the vaginal canal), because doing so removes the discharge needed to make the diagnosis. The area is observed for erythema, edema, excoriation, and discharge. Each of the infection-producing organisms produces its own characteristic discharge and effect (see <a href="c51-sec02.xhtml#tt51-1">Table&#x00A0;51-1</a>). The patient is asked to describe any discharge and other symptoms, such as odor, itching, or burning. Dysuria often occurs as a result of local irritation of the urinary meatus. A urinary tract infection may need to be ruled out by obtaining a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity testing.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is asked about the occurrence of factors that may contribute to vulvovaginal infection:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Physical and chemical factors, such as constant moisture from tight or synthetic clothing, perfumes and powders, soaps, bubble bath, poor hygiene, and the use of feminine hygiene products</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1680" title="1680"></span>Psychogenic factors (e.g., stress, fear of STIs, intimate partner violence [IPV])</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Medical conditions or endocrine factors, such as a predisposition to <em>Monilia</em> in a patient who has diabetes</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The use of medications such as antibiotics, which may alter the vaginal flora and allow an overgrowth of monilial organisms</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>New sex partner, multiple sex partners, previous vaginal infection</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient is also asked about factors that could contribute to infection, including hygiene practices (douching) and the use or nonuse of condoms.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse may prepare a vaginal smear (wet mount) to assist in diagnosing the infection. A common method for preparing the smear is to collect vaginal secretions with an applicator and place the secretions on two separate glass slides. A drop of saline solution is added to one slide and a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is added to another slide for examination under a microscope. If bacterial vaginosis is present, the slide with normal saline solution added shows epithelial cells dotted with bacteria (clue cells). If <em>Trichomonas</em> species is present, small motile cells are seen. In the presence of yeast, the potassium hydroxide slide reveals branching hyphae (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Discharge associated with bacterial vaginosis produces a strong odor when mixed with potassium hydroxide. Testing the pH of the discharge with Nitrazine paper assists in proper diagnosis (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Discomfort associated with distressing symptoms and feelings of discomfort from the infectious process</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with worry about symptoms</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Risk for infection or spread of infection</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge about proper hygiene and preventive measures</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Major goals may include increased comfort, reduction of anxiety related to symptoms, prevention of reinfection or infection of sexual partner, and acquisition of knowledge about methods for preventing vulvovaginal infections and managing self-care.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> I<small>MPAIRED</small> C<small>OMFORT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Treatment with the appropriate medication usually relieves discomfort. Sitz baths may be occasionally recommended and may provide temporary relief of symptoms.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Vulvovaginal infections are upsetting and require treatment. The patient who experiences such an infection may be very anxious about the significance of the symptoms and possible causes. Explaining the cause of symptoms may reduce anxiety related to fear of a more serious illness. Discussing ways to help prevent vulvovaginal infections may help patients adopt specific strategies to decrease infection and the related symptoms.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> R<small>EINFECTION OR</small> S<small>PREAD OF</small> I<small>NFECTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patient education should include the fact that vulvovaginal candidiasis is not an STI and incidence can be decreased by completing treatment, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic agents, wearing cotton underwear, and not douching.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient needs to be informed about the importance of adequate treatment for herself and her partner, if indicated. Other strategies to prevent persistence or spread of infection include abstaining from penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse when infected, treatment for sexual partners, and minimizing irritation of the affected area. When medications such as antibiotic agents are prescribed for any infection, the nurse instructs the patient about the usual precautions related to using these agents. If vaginal itching occurs several days after use, the patient can be reassured that this is usually not an allergic reaction but may be a yeast or monilial infection resulting from altered vaginal bacteria. Treatment for monilial infection is prescribed if indicated.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Another goal of treatment is to reduce tissue irritation caused by scratching or wearing tight clothing. The area needs to be kept clean by daily bathing and adequate hygiene after voiding and defecation. The use of a hair dryer on a cool setting will dry the area, and application of topical corticosteroids may decrease irritation.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When educating the patient about medications such as suppositories and devices such as applicators to dispense cream or ointment, the nurse may demonstrate the procedure by using a plastic model of the pelvis and vagina. The nurse should also stress the importance of hand hygiene before and after each administration of medication. To prevent the medication from escaping from the vagina, the patient should recline for 30 minutes after it is inserted, if possible. The patient is informed that seepage of medication may occur, and the use of a perineal pad may be helpful.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> <span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> Vulvovaginal conditions are treated on an outpatient basis unless a patient has other medical problems. Patient education, tact, and reassurance are important aspects of nursing care. Women may express embarrassment, guilt, or anger and may be concerned that the infection could be serious or that it may have been acquired from a sex partner. In some instances, treatment plans include the partner.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s learning needs about the immediate problem. The patient needs to know the characteristics of normal as opposed to abnormal discharge. Questions often arise about douching. Normally, douching and the use of feminine hygiene sprays are unnecessary because daily baths or showers and proper hygiene after voiding and defecating keep the perineal area clean. Douching tends to eliminate normal flora, reducing the body&#x2019;s ability to ward off infection. In addition, repeated douching may result in vaginal epithelial breakdown and chemical irritation and has been associated with other pelvic disorders. In the case of recurrent yeast infections, the perineum should be kept as dry as possible. Loose-fitting cotton instead of tight-fitting synthetic, nonabsorbent, heat-retaining underwear is recommended.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Vulvar self-examination is a good health practice for all women. Becoming familiar with one&#x2019;s own anatomy and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1681" title="1681"></span>reporting anything that seems new or different may result in early detection and treatment of any new disorders. Nurses can also play a role in educating women about the risks of unprotected penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse, particularly with partners who have had sex with others.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;evaluation:&lt;/b&gt; determination of the patient&#x2019;s response to nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved">Evaluation</button></strong></p>
