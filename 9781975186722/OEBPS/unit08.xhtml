<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps8">Y</span>ou are a nurse working on an orthopedic unit caring for a 76-year-old female with osteoporosis who had fallen at home and underwent a right hip replacement. She is 2&#x00A0;days postoperative, recovering from her surgery without complications, and you are discussing plans for her transition to a skilled rehabilitation unit. However, the patient does not want to get out of bed and participate in physical or occupational therapy because she is in pain. Despite having spoken with the pain team, she states she does not want to take any medications that may cause her to become addicted. You need to develop an evidence-based plan of care that implements pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies for pain management so the patient is able to participate in her physical and occupational therapies and thus help facilitate her recovery.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
