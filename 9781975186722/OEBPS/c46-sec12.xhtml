<h4 class="h4" id="s2073">Management of Patients with Diabetes Who Are Hospitalized</h4>
<p class="nonindent">At any one time, as many as 25% of hospitalized general medical-surgical patients have diabetes (ADA, 2020). Often, diabetes is not the primary medical diagnosis, yet problems with control of diabetes frequently result from changes in the patient&#x2019;s normal routine or from surgery or illness. Patients who are hospitalized and have a diagnosis of diabetes should have this clearly indicated on their electronic health record (EHR), and glucose monitoring needs to be prescribed (ADA, 2020). During the course of treatment, blood glucose control may worsen. Control of blood glucose levels is important because hyperglycemia in patients who are hospitalized can increase the length of hospital stay, the risk of infection, and mortality (ADA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, this is an opportunity for patients with diabetes to update their knowledge about diabetes self-care and prevention of complications. Nurses caring for patients with diabetes should focus attention on the diabetes as well as the primary health issue.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1527" title="1527"></span></p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Approaches to Management of Glucose Control During the Perioperative Period for Those with a Diagnosis of Diabetes</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Monitor blood glucose levels frequently (every 1 to 2 hours).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>For patients taking insulin:</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>The morning of surgery, all subcutaneous insulin doses are withheld, unless the blood glucose level is elevated (e.g., &#x003E;200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]), in which case a small dose of subcutaneous regular insulin may be prescribed. The blood glucose level is controlled during surgery with the IV infusion of regular insulin, which is balanced by an infusion of dextrose. The insulin and dextrose infusion rates are adjusted according to frequent (hourly) capillary glucose determinations. After surgery, the insulin infusion may be continued until the patient can eat. If IV insulin is discontinued, subcutaneous regular insulin may be given at set intervals (every 4 to 6 hours), or intermediate-acting insulin may be given every 12 hours with supplemental regular insulin as necessary until the patient is eating and the usual pattern of insulin dosing is resumed.</p>
<p class="BoxBL3Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Carefully monitor the insulin infusion rate and blood glucose levels in a patient with diabetes who is receiving IV insulin. IV insulin has a much shorter duration of action than subcutaneous insulin. If the infusion is interrupted or discontinued, hyperglycemia will develop rapidly (within 1 hour in type 1 diabetes and within a few hours in type 2 diabetes).</p>
<p class="BoxBL3Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ensure that subcutaneous insulin is given 30 minutes before the IV insulin infusion is discontinued.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>One half to two thirds of the patient&#x2019;s usual morning dose of insulin (either intermediate-acting insulin alone or both short- and intermediate-acting insulins) is given subcutaneously in the morning before surgery. The remainder is then given after surgery.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>The patient&#x2019;s usual daily dose of subcutaneous insulin is divided into 4 equal doses of regular insulin. These are then given at 6-hour intervals. The last 2 approaches do not provide the control achieved by IV administration of insulin and dextrose.</p>
<p class="BoxBL3Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Patients with type 2 diabetes who do not usually take insulin may require insulin during the perioperative period to control blood glucose elevations. Patients who are taking metformin may be instructed to discontinue the oral agent 24 to 48 hours before surgery, if possible. Some of these patients may resume their usual regimen of diet and oral agent during the recovery period. Other patients (whose diabetes is probably not well controlled with diet and an oral antidiabetic agent before surgery) need to continue with insulin injections after discharge.</p>
<p class="BoxBL3Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>For patients with type 2 diabetes who are undergoing minor surgery but who do not normally take insulin, glucose levels may remain stable provided no dextrose is infused during the surgery. After surgery, these patients may require small doses of regular insulin until the usual diet and oral agent are resumed.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2074">Self-Care Issues</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For patients who are actively involved in diabetes self-management (especially insulin dose adjustment), relinquishing control over meal timing, insulin timing, and insulin dosage can be particularly difficult and anxiety provoking. The patient may fear hypoglycemia and express much concern over possible delays in receiving attention from the nurse if hypoglycemic symptoms occur or may disagree with a planned dose of insulin.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse acknowledges the patient&#x2019;s concerns and involves the patient in the plan of care as much as possible. If the patient disagrees with certain aspects of the care related to diabetes, the nurse must communicate this to other members of the health care team. Nurses and other health care providers must pay particular attention to patients who are successful in managing self-care; they should assess these patients&#x2019; self-care management skills and encourage them to continue if their performance is correct and effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Hospitalization of a patient with diabetes should be considered an opportunity to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s self-care skills and to reinforce or deliver education that might be needed. The nurse observes the patient preparing and injecting the insulin, monitoring blood glucose, and performing foot care. Simply questioning the patient about these skills without actually observing performance of the skills is not sufficient. The patient&#x2019;s knowledge about diet can be assessed with the help of a dietitian through direct questioning and review of the patient&#x2019;s menu choices. The patient&#x2019;s understanding about signs and symptoms, treatment, and prevention of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is assessed, along with knowledge of risk factors for macrovascular disease, including hypertension, increased lipids, and smoking. In addition, the patient is asked the date of their last eye examination (including dilation of the pupils). Education about these issues is critical.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2075">Hyperglycemia During Hospitalization</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperglycemia may occur in patients who are hospitalized as a result of the original illness that led to the need for hospitalization. A number of other factors may contribute to hyperglycemia; examples include:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Changes in the usual treatment regimen (e.g., increased food, decreased insulin, decreased activity)</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Medications (e.g., corticosteroids such as prednisone, which are used in the treatment of a variety of inflammatory disorders)</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>IV dextrose, which may be part of the maintenance fluids or may be used for the administration of antibiotics and other medications, without adequate insulin therapy</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Overly vigorous treatment of hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Inappropriate withholding of insulin or inappropriate use of &#x201C;sliding scales&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Mismatched timing of meals and insulin (e.g., postmeal hyperglycemia may occur if short-acting insulin is given immediately before or even after a meal)</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing actions to correct some of these factors are important for avoiding hyperglycemia. Assessment of the patient&#x2019;s usual home routine is important. The nurse should try to approximate as much as possible the home schedule of insulin, meals, and activities. Monitoring blood glucose levels has been identified by the ADA as an additional &#x201C;vital sign&#x201D; essential in assessment of patients (ADA, 2020). The results of blood glucose monitoring provide information needed to obtain orders for extra doses of insulin (at times when insulin is usually taken), which is an important nursing function. Insulin doses must not be withheld when blood glucose levels are normal. It is very important to test blood glucose before a meal and administer insulin at that time, not on a rigid set time schedule as other medications are given. Insulin should be given when the meal is served to prevent hypoglycemia and elicit a physiologic response.</p>
<p class="indent">Short-acting insulin is usually needed to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia (even in patients with normal premeal glucose levels), and NPH insulin does not peak until many hours after the dose is given. IV antibiotics should be mixed in NS (if possible) to avoid excess infusion of dextrose (especially in patients who are eating). It is important to avoid overly vigorous treatment of hypoglycemia, which may lead to hyperglycemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2076">Hypoglycemia During Hospitalization</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoglycemia in patients who are hospitalized is usually the result of too much insulin or delays in eating. Specific examples include:</p>
<p class="BL1First serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Overuse of sliding-scale regular insulin, particularly as a supplement to regularly scheduled, twice-daily short- and intermediate-acting insulins</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Lack of change in insulin dosage when dietary intake is changed (e.g., in the patient taking nothing by mouth [NPO])</p>
<p class="BL1Middle serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Overly vigorous treatment of hyperglycemia (e.g., giving too-frequent successive doses of regular insulin before the time of peak insulin activity is reached), resulting in a cumulative effect</p>
<p class="BL1Last serif"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Delayed meal after administration of lispro, aspart, or glulisine insulin (patient should eat within 5 to 15 minutes after insulin administration)</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of hypoglycemia should be based on the established hospital protocol (ADA, 2020). If the initial treatment does not increase the glucose level adequately, the same treatment may be repeated after 15 minutes. The nurse must assess the pattern of glucose values and avoid giving doses of insulin that repeatedly lead to hypoglycemia. Successive doses of subcutaneous regular insulin should be given no more frequently than every 3 to 4 hours. For patients receiving intermediate insulin before breakfast and dinner, the nurse must use caution in administering supplemental doses of regular insulin at lunch and bedtime. Hypoglycemia may occur when two insulins peak at similar times (e.g., morning NPH peaks with lunchtime regular insulin and may lead to late-afternoon hypoglycemia; dinnertime NPH peaks with bedtime regular insulin and may lead to nocturnal hypoglycemia). To avoid hypoglycemic reactions caused by delayed food intake, the nurse should arrange for snacks to be given to the patient if meals are going to be delayed because of procedures, physical therapy, or other activities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2077">Common Alterations in Diet</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dietary modifications commonly prescribed during hospitalization require special consideration for patients who have diabetes (ADA, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nothing by Mouth</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For patients who must be NPO in preparation for diagnostic or surgical procedures, the nurse must ensure that the usual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1529" title="1529"></span>insulin dosage has been changed. These changes may include eliminating the rapid-acting insulin and giving a decreased amount (e.g., half the usual dose) of intermediate-acting insulin. Another approach is to use frequent (every 3 to 4 hours) dosing of rapid-acting insulin only. IV dextrose may be given to provide calories and to avoid hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Even without food, glucose levels may increase as a result of hepatic glucose production, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes and lean patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, in type 1 diabetes, elimination of the insulin dose may lead to the development of DKA. Administration of basal insulin to patients with type 1 diabetes who are NPO is an important nursing action.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin, DKA does not usually develop when insulin doses are eliminated because the patient&#x2019;s pancreas produces some insulin. Therefore, skipping the insulin dose altogether (when the patient is receiving IV dextrose) may be safe; however, close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are NPO for extended periods (24 hours), glucose testing and insulin administration should be performed at regular intervals, usually four times per day. Insulin regimens for the patient who is NPO for an extended period may include NPH insulin every 12 hours, rapid-acting insulin only every 4 to 6 hours, or an IV insulin drip. These patients should receive dextrose infusions to provide some calories and limit ketosis.</p>
<p class="indent">To prevent the problems that result from the need to withhold food, diagnostic tests and procedures and surgery should be scheduled early in the morning when possible.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Clear Liquid Diet</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When the diet is advanced to include clear liquids, patients with diabetes receive more simple carbohydrate foods, such as juice and gelatin desserts, than are usually included in the diabetic diet. Because patients who are hospitalized should maintain their nutritional status as much as possible to promote healing, the use of reduced-calorie substitutes such as diet soda or diet gelatin desserts would not be appropriate when the only source of calories is clear liquids. Simple carbohydrates, if eaten alone, cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels; therefore, it is important to try to match peak times of insulin effect with peaks in the blood glucose concentration. If the patient receives insulin at regular intervals while NPO, the scheduled times for glucose tests and insulin injections should match mealtimes.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Enteral Tube Feedings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tube feeding formulas contain more simple carbohydrates and less protein and fat than the typical meal plan for diabetes (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>). This results in increased levels of glucose in patients with diabetes who are receiving tube feedings. Insulin doses must be given at regular intervals (e.g., NPH every 12 hours or regular insulin every 4 to 6 hours) when continuous tube feedings are given. If insulin is administered at routine (prebreakfast and predinner) times, hypoglycemia during the day may result (because the patient receives more insulin without more calories); hyperglycemia may occur during the night if feedings continue but insulin action decreases.</p>
<p class="indent">A common cause of hypoglycemia in patients receiving both continuous tube feedings and insulin is inadvertent or purposeful discontinuation of the feeding. The nurse must discuss with the medical team any plans for temporarily discontinuing the tube feeding (e.g., when the patient is away from the unit). Planning ahead may allow for alterations to be made in the insulin dose or for administration of IV dextrose. In addition, if problems with the tube feeding develop unexpectedly (e.g., the patient pulls out the tube, the tube clogs, the feeding is discontinued when residual gastric contents are found), the nurse must notify the primary provider, assess blood glucose levels more frequently, and administer IV dextrose if indicated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Parenteral Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients receiving parenteral nutrition may receive both IV insulin (added to the parenteral nutrition IV bag) and subcutaneous intermediate- or short-acting insulins. If the patient is receiving continuous parenteral nutrition, the blood glucose level should be monitored and insulin given at regular intervals. If the parenteral nutrition is infused over a limited number of hours, subcutaneous insulin should be given so that peak times of insulin action coincide with times of parenteral nutrition infusion (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> for discussion of parenteral nutrition).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2078">Hygiene</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses caring for hospitalized patients with diabetes must focus attention on oral hygiene and skin care. Because these patients are at increased risk for periodontal disease, the nurse assists with at least daily dental care. The patient may also require assistance in keeping the skin clean and dry, especially in areas of contact between two skin surfaces (e.g., groin, axilla, under the breasts), where chafing and fungal infections tend to occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Careful assessments of the oral cavity and the skin are important. The skin is assessed for dryness, cracks, breakdown, and redness, especially at pressure points and on the lower extremities. The patient is asked about symptoms of neuropathy, such as tingling and pain or numbness of the feet. Deep tendon reflexes are assessed.</p>
<p class="indent">As with any patient confined to bed, nursing care must emphasize the prevention of skin breakdown at pressure points. The heels are particularly susceptible to breakdown because of loss of sensation of pain and pressure associated with sensory neuropathy.</p>
<p class="indent">Feet should be cleaned, dried, lubricated with lotion (but not between the toes), and inspected frequently. If the patient is in the supine position, pressure on the heels can be alleviated by elevating the lower legs on a pillow, with the heels positioned over the edge of the pillow. When the patient is seated in a chair, the feet should be positioned so that pressure is not placed on the heels. If the patient has an ulceration on one foot, the nurse provides preventive care to the unaffected foot as well as special care of the affected foot.</p>
<p class="indent">As always, every opportunity should be taken to educate the patient about diabetes self-management, including daily oral, skin, and foot care. Female patients should also be instructed about measures for the avoidance of vaginal infections, which occur more frequently when blood glucose levels are elevated. Patients often take their cues from nurses and realize the importance of daily personal hygiene if this is emphasized during their hospitalization.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2079">Stress</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Physiologic stress, such as infections and surgery, contributes to hyperglycemia and may precipitate DKA or HHS. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1530" title="1530"></span>Emotional stress related to hospitalization for any reason can also have a negative impact on diabetic control. An increase in stress hormones leads to an increase in glucose levels, especially if intake of food and insulin remains unchanged. In addition, during periods of emotional stress, people with diabetes may alter their usual pattern of meals, exercise, and medication. This can contribute to hyperglycemia or even hypoglycemia (e.g., in the patient taking insulin or oral antidiabetic agents who stops eating in response to stress).</p>
<p class="indent">People with diabetes must be made aware of the potential deterioration in diabetic control that can accompany emotional stress. They must be encouraged to follow the diabetes treatment plan as much as possible during times of stress. In addition, learning strategies for minimizing stress and coping with stress when it does occur are important aspects of diabetes education.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2080"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because people with diabetes are living longer, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are being seen more frequently in older patients hospitalized for various reasons. Regardless of the type or duration of diabetes, the goals of diabetes treatment may need to be altered when caring for older adults who are hospitalized. The focus is on quality-of-life issues, such as maintaining independent functioning and promoting general well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the barriers to learning and self-care during hospital stays and in preparing patients for discharge include decreased vision, hearing loss, memory deficits, decreased mobility and fine motor coordination, increased tremors, depression and isolation, decreased financial resources, and limitations related to disability and other medical disorders. Assessing these barriers is important in planning diabetes treatment and educational activities. Presenting brief, simplified instructions with ample opportunity for practice of skills is important. The use of special devices such as a magnifier for the insulin syringe, an insulin pen, or a mirror for foot inspection is helpful. Frequent evaluation of self-care skills (insulin administration, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, diet planning) is essential, especially in patients with deteriorating vision and memory. Providing written instructions with handouts to take home also assists with management in the home setting.</p>
<p class="indent">If appropriate, family members may be called on to assist with diabetes basic skills, and referral to community resources may be made. It is preferable to educate the patient or family members to test blood glucose at home; the choice of meter should be tailored to the patient&#x2019;s visual and cognitive status and dexterity.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Careful monitoring for complications of diabetes in older adults is vital. Hypoglycemia is especially dangerous, because it may go undetected and result in falls. Dehydration is a concern in patients who have chronically elevated blood glucose levels. Assessment for long-term complications, especially eye and foot problems, is important. Avoiding blindness and amputation through early detection and treatment of retinopathy and foot ulcerations may mean the difference between placement in a long-term care facility and continued independent living for the older adult with diabetes.</em></p></div>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2081">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment for hypo- and hyperglycemia involves frequent blood glucose monitoring (usually prescribed before meals and at bedtime) and monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia or prolonged hyperglycemia (including DKA or HHS), as described previously. Inadequate control of blood glucose levels may hinder recovery from the primary health problem. Blood glucose levels are monitored, and insulin is given as prescribed. The nurse must ensure that prescribed insulin dosage is modified as needed to compensate for changes in the patient&#x2019;s schedule or eating pattern. Treatment is given for hypoglycemia (with oral glucose) or hyperglycemia (with supplemental regular insulin no more often than every 3 to 4 hours). Blood glucose records are assessed for patterns of hypo- and hyperglycemia at the same time of day, and findings are reported to the primary provider for modification in insulin orders. In the patient with prolonged elevations in blood glucose, laboratory values and the patient&#x2019;s physical condition are monitored for signs and symptoms of DKA or HHS.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Even if patients have had diabetes for many years, their knowledge and adherence to the plan of care must be assessed. A new plan of care may need to be devised using updated evidence. The nurse also reminds the patient and family about the importance of health promotion activities and recommended health screening.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A patient who is hospitalized may require referral for home, community-based or transitional care. The nurse can use this opportunity to assess the patient&#x2019;s knowledge about diabetes management and the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to carry out that management. The nurse reinforces the education provided in the hospital, clinic, office, or diabetes education center and assesses the home care environment to determine its adequacy for self-care and safety.</p>
