In contrast, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;chronic illness:&lt;/b&gt; the experience of living with a chronic disease or condition; the person&#x2019;s perception of the experience and the person&#x2019;s and others&#x2019; responses to the chronic disease or condition">chronic illness</button></strong> refers to the human experience of living with a chronic disease or condition. Chronic illness includes the person&#x2019;s perception of the experience of having a chronic disease or condition and the person&#x2019;s and others&#x2019; responses to it, including health care professionals (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>). Persons&#x2019; and their families&#x2019; values and previous experiences determine their perceptions and beliefs about the condition, which in turn affect their illness and wellness behaviors. Their values are influenced by a number of demographic, socioeconomic, technologic, cultural, and environmental variables. Only the person and the family really know what it is like to live with chronic illness (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The following section of this chapter discusses chronic illness and its implications for nursing practice. Because some degree of disability is often present in severe or advanced chronic illness, the previous discussion about disability is relevant to chronic disease as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic diseases are long-term health conditions that affect one&#x2019;s well-being and function in an episodic, continuous, or progressive way over many years of life. Although each chronic disease or condition has its own specific physiologic characteristics, many chronic conditions share common features. For example, common symptoms typically include pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and difficulty adjusting to the onset and uncertainty of a chronic condition (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>). Many people with chronic health conditions and disability function independently with little or no inconvenience to their everyday lives; others, however, require frequent and close monitoring or placement in long-term care facilities. Certain conditions require advanced technology for survival, as in the late stages of chronic obstructive lung disease or end-stage renal disease, or intensive care or mechanical ventilation for periods of weeks, months, or years. People with disorders such as these have been described as being chronically critically ill, although there is no consensus on a definition of chronic critical illness. An overview of chronic disease in the United States is presented in <a href="#ct7-7">Chart&#x00A0;7-7</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s133">Multiple Chronic Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Having <strong>multiple chronic conditions (MCC)</strong> increases the complexity of care and often necessitates care by multiple health care specialists, a variety of treatment regimens, and prescription medications that may not interact. Thus, patients with MCC are at risk for conflicting medical advice, adverse effects of medications, unnecessary and duplicative tests, and preventable hospitalizations, all of which can negatively affect their health (CDC, 2019b). Patients with MCC and their families may have to keep track of different medications with different schedules and multiple appointments with various health care professionals. Costs of health care increase with the number of chronic conditions a person has; those with five or more chronic conditions account for 41% of total health expenditures in the United States (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Buttorff, Ruder, &#x0026; Bauman, 2017</a>). Approximately 80% of health care costs in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" title="156"></span>United States are associated with having MCC. Approximately 93% of the total health care expenditures for those who are covered by Medicare are associated with MCC. In addition, out-of-pocket health-related expenses increase with the number of MCC. Facts about MCC are summarized in <a href="#ct7-8">Chart&#x00A0;7-8</a>.</p>

<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Chronic disease and conditions (e.g., heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, arthritis) are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and diabetes pose greater risks as people age.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Chronic disease, specifically diabetes, is the leading cause of kidney failure, amputation of lower extremities, and new causes of blindness among adults.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obesity is a serious health concern with one third of adults and one of five youths having obesity.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of exercise or physical activity, poor nutrition, use of tobacco, and excessive alcohol use contribute to the growing prevalence of chronic diseases and resulting disability. Tobacco remains the leading cause of six million preventable deaths per year globally. Although cigarette smoking among U.S. youths has declined steadily over the past two decades, the recent introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has resulted in increased exposure of youth to nicotine, considered an epidemic by the U.S. Surgeon General&#x2019;s office.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Americans living in rural communities are more likely to have chronic disease, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, than those living in nonrural areas.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eighty-six percent of all health care spending is related in general to chronic disease.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>People with chronic disease may have other health problems that may or may not be related to the primary chronic disease; these include alcohol abuse and substance use or addiction disorders, mental illness, dementia or other cognitive impairments, and developmental disabilities.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Facts About Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>About half of all adults&#x2014;117 million people&#x2014;have one or more chronic health conditions. One of every four adults has two or more chronic health conditions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The occurrence of MCC increases with age. Three in every four Americans 65 years of age and older have MCC.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>The number of people with MCC is predicted to increase substantially over the next decade, adding to the pressures on the health care system to deliver high quality of care, at optimal cost, while improving the health of this complex population.</p>

<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Non-Hispanic White adults, non-Hispanic Black adults, and non-Hispanic adults of other races have a high prevalence of MCC.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>As the number of chronic conditions a person has increases, the greater the risk of dying prematurely, being hospitalized, and having poor day-to-day functioning.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s134">Health Disparities and Chronic Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although chronic disease occurs in all socioeconomic groups, people from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to report poor health. Factors such as poverty and inadequate health insurance decrease the likelihood that people with chronic illness or disability receive health care and preventive health-screening measures such as mammography, cholesterol testing, and routine checkups (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib438">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2017</a>; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2018</a>). In addition, chronic conditions can lead to poverty for the patient and the family. There also are implications for society or the nation as a whole, because chronic conditions or subsequent premature deaths occur most commonly during the most productive years for people with chronic conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Disparities in health and health outcomes are associated with social, economic, and environmental disadvantages. Although the gap between health outcomes in African Americans and Caucasians has decreased in some areas, in others (e.g., mortality due to breast cancer) the gaps have increased. Disparities in health and health outcomes are associated with higher incidence and prevalence, earlier onset, faster progression, and poorer outcomes of disease and conditions (NASEM, 2017; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some chronic conditions have little effect on quality of life, whereas others have a major effect because they result in disability. However, not all disabilities are a result of chronic illness, and not all chronic illnesses cause disability. Unlike <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page157" title="157"></span>the term <em>acute,</em> which implies a curable and relatively short disease course, the term <em>chronic</em> describes a long disease course that may be incurable. This often makes managing chronic conditions difficult for those who live with them. Yet nurses can and do make a difference in the experience of chronic illness by providing quality nursing care in the absence of a cure (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Psychological and emotional reactions of patients to acute and chronic conditions and changes in their health status are described in <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. People who develop chronic conditions or disabilities may react with shock, disbelief, anger, resentment, or other emotions. How people react to and cope with chronic illness is usually similar to how they react to other events in their lives, depending, in part, on their understanding of the condition and their perceptions of its potential impact on their own and their family&#x2019;s lives. Adjustment to chronic illness (and disability) is affected by various factors:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Suddenness, extent, and duration of lifestyle changes necessitated by the illness</span></li>
<li><span>Uncertainty related to the course and outcome of chronic illnesses</span></li>
<li><span>Family and individual resources for dealing with stress</span></li>
<li><span>Availability of support from family, friends, and the community</span></li>
<li><span>Stages of individual/family life cycle</span></li>
<li><span>Previous experience with illness and crises</span></li>
<li><span>Underlying personality characteristics</span></li>
<li><span>Unresolved anger or grief from the past</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Psychological, emotional, and cognitive reactions to chronic conditions are likely to occur at their onset and to recur if symptoms worsen or return after a period of remission. Symptoms associated with chronic health conditions are often unpredictable and may be perceived as crisis events by patients and their families, who must contend with both the uncertainty of chronic illness and the changes it brings to their lives. The possible effects of chronic conditions can guide nursing assessment and interventions for the patient who has a chronic illness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s135">Definitions of Chronic Diseases or Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic diseases or conditions are often defined as medical conditions or health problems with associated symptoms or disabilities that require long-term management. Chronic diseases are those that persist for months or years rather than days or weeks (Larson, 2019). The National Center for Health Statistics defines chronic disease as a condition lasting 3 or more months; the CDC&#x2019;s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) (CDC, 2019a) defines it as a condition that lasts for a year or more and that can usually be controlled but not cured. Definitions of chronic disease or chronic illness share the characteristics of being irreversible, having a prolonged course, and remaining unlikely to resolve spontaneously (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Larsen, 2019</a>). The specific chronic condition may be a result of illness, genetic factors, or injury; it may be a consequence of conditions or unhealthy behaviors that began during childhood and young adulthood.</p>
<p class="indent">The social determinants of health (SDOH) provide a useful framework to identify factors that affect a person&#x2019;s or a population&#x2019;s health, including the prevalence of chronic disease, its management, the quality of health care that is available, and the outcomes of chronic disease. The main SDOH that have been identified include income and social status, employment and working conditions, education and literacy, childhood experiences, physical environment, social supports and coping skills, healthy behaviors, access to health services, biology and genetic makeup, gender, culture, race and ethnicity (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib491">Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of SDOH is illustrated by large discrepancies in life expectancy, up to a 48-year difference among countries and 20 years or more within countries. Deaths due to chronic disease are expected to increase globally, from 41 million deaths reported in 2016 (many of which were premature) to 52 million per year by 2030 (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2018</a>; WHO, 2018c, 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">Management of chronic conditions includes learning to live with symptoms or resulting disabilities and coming to terms with identity changes resulting from having a chronic condition. Management also consists of carrying out the lifestyle changes and regimens designed to control symptoms and prevent complications. Although some people assume what might be called a &#x201C;sick role&#x201D; identity, most people with chronic conditions do not consider themselves to be sick or ill and try to live as normal a life as possible. Only when complications develop or symptoms interfere with ADLs do most people with chronic health conditions think of themselves as being sick or having a disability.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s136">Prevalence and Causes of Chronic Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic conditions occur in people of every age group, socioeconomic level, race, and culture. Six in 10 adults in the United States have a chronic disease. Chronic diseases are the most common causes of death in the United States; the most frequently occurring chronic diseases account for 7 of the 10 leading causes of death, with cancer and heart disease together accounting for nearly half of all deaths. Globally, chronic diseases are responsible for more than two thirds of deaths. Chronic diseases include cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases (CDC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic diseases or disorders are one of the major health and development challenges of this century because of their global impact on human, social, and financial well-being and status. Although chronic diseases affect all countries, their impact is more severe in low- and middle-income countries, with devastating consequences in poor and vulnerable populations. Chronic diseases cause more deaths than all other causes combined, and lifespan is shortened by chronic illnesses in those countries.</p>
<p class="indent">It is predicted that by the year 2030, about half the population will have a chronic disease or disorder. One fifth of those with chronic disease also have an activity limitation. As the incidence of chronic diseases increases, the costs associated with these chronic conditions (e.g., hospital costs, equipment, medications, supportive services) also increase. These costs represent four of every five health care dollars expended. In the United States, chronic diseases are also leading drivers of the nation&#x2019;s $3.5 trillion in annual health care costs (NCCDPHP, 2020; <a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2018</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 157</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page158" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="158">p. 158</span></div>
<p class="indent">Although some chronic diseases are associated with nonmodifiable factors, including genetic and physiologic factors, many are the result of unhealthy lifestyles. Most chronic diseases are caused by four major behaviors: use of tobacco, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), and exposure to secondhand smoke; poor nutrition (diets high in sodium and saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables); lack of physical activity; and excessive consumption of alcohol (CDC, 2019a; WHO, 2018c). Because these behaviors are modifiable, nurses have a major role in the prevention of chronic disorders associated with these behaviors (for more detailed information, see later discussion in section on Prevention of Chronic Disease).</p>
<p class="indent">Some chronic health conditions cause little or no inconvenience; others are severe enough to cause major activity limitations that may prevent people from meeting their needs for health care and personal services. For example, they may be unable to carry out their therapeutic regimens or have their prescriptions filled on time, may miss appointments and office visits with their health care providers, and may be unable to manage ADLs.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic diseases are a global issue that affects both rich and poor nations. The total number of people dying from chronic disease is twice that of patients dying from infectious (including human immunodeficiency virus infection), maternal, and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies combined (WHO, 2019). Most of these chronic diseases and complications of chronic illness are preventable, emphasizing the importance of health promotion across the globe. Although chronic diseases or illnesses are common, people have many myths or misunderstandings about them (<a href="#tt7-1">Table&#x00A0;7-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Causes of the increasing number of people with chronic conditions include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>A decrease in mortality from infectious diseases (e.g., smallpox, diphtheria, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]&#x2013;related infections) because of immunizations and new drug development and from acute conditions (e.g., myocardial infarction, trauma) because of prompt and aggressive management.</span></li>
<li><span>Lifestyle factors such as smoking, chronic stress, poor nutrition, and sedentary lifestyle that increase the risk of chronic health problems such as respiratory disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Although signs and symptoms of chronic illness often first appear during older age, risks typically begin earlier in life, even during fetal development.</span></li>
<li><span> <img class="m" src="images/nutritionalstatus.png" alt=""/> Obesity, often due to lifestyle issues, has become a major health issue across the lifespan and across the globe with about 2.1 billion people overweight and one third of them having obesity. Obesity is no longer limited to high-income countries but increasingly occurs in low- and middle-income countries. The proportion of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from about 29% to 37% in men and about 30% to 38% in women (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Kushner &#x0026; Kahan, 2018</a>). It is estimated that unless this trend is reversed, almost half of the world&#x2019;s population will be overweight or have obesity by 2030. Approximately 5% of deaths worldwide are due to obesity (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib501">Tremmel, Gerdtham, Nilsson, et al., 2017</a>). The increasing prevalence of obesity has increased the incidence of heart <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page159" title="159"></span>disease, strokes, diabetes, and hypertension. Obesity also affects one&#x2019;s self-esteem, achievement, and emotional state. In 2015, high BMI contributed to four million deaths globally, which was over 7% of deaths from any cause (<a href="c07-sec06.xhtml#bib536">Kushner &#x0026; Kahan, 2018</a>).</span></li></ul>
