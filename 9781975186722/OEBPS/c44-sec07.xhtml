<p class="nonindent">Approximately 200,000 cases of acute pancreatitis occur in the United States each year, of which 80% are the result of cholelithiasis or sustained alcohol abuse (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih, Fan, &#x0026; Singh, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson, Perelman, &#x0026; Birk, 2019</a>). Acute pancreatitis ranges from a mild, self-limited disorder to a severe, rapidly fatal disease that does not respond to any treatment. These two main types of acute pancreatitis (mild and severe) are classified as interstitial edematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, respectively. Interstitial pancreatitis affects the majority of patients. It is characterized by a lack of pancreatic or peripancreatic parenchymal necrosis with diffuse enlargement of the gland due to inflammatory edema (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). The edema and inflammation in interstitial pancreatitis is confined to the pancreas itself. Minimal organ dysfunction is present, and return to normal function usually occurs within 6 months. Although this is considered the milder form of pancreatitis, the patient is acutely ill and at risk for hypovolemic shock, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and sepsis.</p>
<p class="indent">In the more severe form, necrotizing pancreatitis, there is tissue necrosis in either the pancreatic parenchyma or in the tissue surrounding the gland. This type can be sterile or infected; if the parenchyma is involved, this is a marker for more severe disease (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3360">Faghih, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). A more widespread and complete enzymatic digestion of the gland characterizes necrotizing pancreatitis. Enzymes damage the local blood vessels, and bleeding and thrombosis can occur. The tissue may become necrotic, with damage extending into the retroperitoneal tissues. Local complications include pancreatic cysts or abscesses and acute fluid collections in or near the pancreas. Patients who develop systemic complications with organ failure, such as pulmonary insufficiency with hypoxia, shock, kidney disease, and GI bleeding, are also characterized as having severe acute pancreatitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1893"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Acute pancreatitis affects people of all ages, but the mortality rate associated with acute pancreatitis increases with age (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). In addition, the pattern of complications changes with age. Younger patients tend to develop local complications; the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) increases with age, possibly as a result of progressive decreases in physiologic function of major organs with increasing age. Close monitoring of major organ function (i.e., lungs, kidneys) is essential, and aggressive treatment is necessary to reduce mortality from acute pancreatitis in the older adult patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1894">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Self-digestion of the pancreas by its own proteolytic enzymes, principally trypsin, causes acute pancreatitis. These patients usually have had undiagnosed chronic pancreatitis before their first episode of acute pancreatitis. Gallstones enter the CBD and lodge at the ampulla of Vater, obstructing the flow of pancreatic juice or causing a reflux of bile from the CBD into the pancreatic duct, thus activating the powerful enzymes within the pancreas. Normally, these remain in an inactive form until the pancreatic secretions reach the lumen of the duodenum (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). Activation of the enzymes can lead to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, necrosis, erosion, and hemorrhage (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Townsend et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Other less common causes of pancreatitis include bacterial or viral infection, with pancreatitis occasionally developing as a complication of mumps viral infection. Spasm and edema of the ampulla of Vater, caused by duodenitis, can probably produce pancreatitis. Blunt abdominal trauma, peptic ulcer disease, ischemic vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, and the use of corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, oral contraceptives, and other medications have also been associated with an increased incidence of pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis may develop after surgery on or near the pancreas or after instrumentation of the pancreatic duct. In addition to alcohol consumption, use of tobacco products is a risk factor for the development of acute and chronic pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3353">Aune, Yahya, Norat, et al., 2019</a>). Acute idiopathic pancreatitis accounts for up to 10% of the cases of acute pancreatitis. Some postulate that these cases may be related to occult microlithiasis (small stones in the bile) (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild, Chouhan, &#x0026; Johnson, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Townsend et al., 2016</a>). In addition, there is a small incidence of hereditary pancreatitis.</p>
<p class="indent">The mortality rate of patients with acute pancreatitis is 2% to 10% because of shock, anoxia, hypotension, or fluid and electrolyte imbalances. This mortality rate may also be related to the 10% to 30% of patients with severe acute disease characterized by pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1430" title="1430"></span>Olson et al., 2019; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Townsend et al., 2016</a>). Pancreatitis may result in complete recovery, may recur without permanent damage, or may progress to chronic pancreatitis. The patient who is admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of pancreatitis is acutely ill and needs expert nursing and medical care.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1895">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Severe abdominal pain is the major symptom of pancreatitis that causes the patient to seek medical care. Abdominal pain and tenderness and back pain result from irritation and edema of the inflamed pancreas. Increased tension on the pancreatic capsule and obstruction of the pancreatic ducts also contribute to the pain. Typically, the pain occurs in the midepigastrium. Pain is frequently acute in onset, occurring 24 to 48&#x00A0;hours after a very heavy meal or alcohol ingestion, and it may be diffuse and difficult to localize. It is generally more severe after meals and is unrelieved by antacids. Pain may be accompanied by abdominal distention; a poorly defined, palpable abdominal mass; decreased peristalsis; and vomiting that fails to relieve the pain or nausea.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient appears acutely ill. Abdominal guarding is present. A rigid or boardlike abdomen may develop, usually indicating peritonitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). Ecchymosis (bruising) in the flank or around the umbilicus may indicate severe pancreatitis. Nausea and vomiting are common in acute pancreatitis. The emesis is usually gastric in origin but may also be bile stained. Fever, jaundice, mental confusion, and agitation may also occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypotension is typical and reflects hypovolemia and shock caused by the loss of large amounts of protein-rich fluid into the tissues and peritoneal cavity. In addition to hypotension, the patient may develop tachycardia; cyanosis; and cold, clammy skin. Acute kidney injury is common.</p>
<p class="indent">Respiratory distress and hypoxia are common, and the patient may develop diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnea, tachypnea, and abnormal blood gas values. Myocardial depression, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may also occur with acute pancreatitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1896">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on the fulfillment of two out of the three following criteria: a history of upper abdominal pain, biochemical changes with serum amylase or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or typical findings on imaging (CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or ultrasonography). The presence of known risk factors is also helpful for diagnostic purposes (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Feldman et al., 2016</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>; Z.orniak, Beyer, &#x0026; Mayerle, 2019). In most cases, serum amylase and lipase levels are elevated within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms. Serum amylase usually returns to normal within 48 to 72 hours, but serum lipase levels may remain elevated for a longer period, often days longer than amylase. Urinary amylase levels also become elevated and remain elevated longer than serum amylase levels. The white blood cell count is usually elevated; hypocalcemia is present in many patients and correlates well with the severity of pancreatitis. Transient hyperglycemia and glucosuria and elevated serum bilirubin levels occur in some patients with acute pancreatitis.</p>
<p class="indent">X-ray studies of the abdomen and chest may be obtained to differentiate pancreatitis from other disorders that can cause similar symptoms and to detect pleural effusions. Ultrasound studies, contrast-enhanced CT scans, and MRI scans are used to identify an increase in the diameter of the pancreas and to detect pancreatic cysts, abscesses, or pseudocysts.</p>
<p class="indent">Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are used to monitor the patient for bleeding. Peritoneal fluid, obtained through paracentesis or peritoneal lavage, may contain increased levels of pancreatic enzymes. ERCP is rarely used in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis, because the patient is acutely ill; however, it may be valuable in the treatment of gallstone pancreatitis.</p>
<p class="indent">The severity of acute pancreatitis is difficult to predict early in the course of the disease, but mortality can be predicted based on clinical and laboratory data (see <a href="#ct44-3">Chart 44-3</a>). According to the revised Atlanta Classification, there are three degrees of severity: (1) mild with the absence of organ failure and no local or systemic complications, (2) moderately severe with the presence of transient organ failure or local or systemic complications, and (3) severe acute pancreatitis characterized by persistent organ failure (&#x003E;48 hours) (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3354">Banks, Bollen, Dervenis, et al., 2013</a>; Z.orniak et al., 2019). Several risk stratification systems aim to predict persistent organ failure and complications. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Ranson Criteria for Pancreatitis Mortality, and Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) are scoring systems that assess clinical and biochemical factors to determine the severity of acute pancreatitis. Laboratory values such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) may also carry some predictive value (Z.orniak et al., 2019). Early prediction of the severity of acute pancreatitis is important for guiding early treatment, choosing the optimal level of care, and identifying patients who might benefit from transfer to a center that specializes in the care of this disease (Z.orniak et al., 2019).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1897">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of acute pancreatitis is directed toward relieving symptoms and preventing or treating complications. All oral intake is withheld to inhibit stimulation of the pancreas and its secretion of enzymes. Ongoing research has shown positive outcomes with the use of enteral feedings. The current recommendation is that, whenever possible, the enteral route should be used to meet nutritional needs in patients with pancreatitis. This strategy also has been found to prevent infectious complications safely and cost-effectively (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">McClave, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Mueller, 2017</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Ramanathan &#x0026; Aadam, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Townsend et al., 2016</a>). Enteral feedings should be started early in the course of acute pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">McClave, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Mueller, 2017</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Ramanathan &#x0026; Aadam, 2019</a>). Parenteral nutrition has a role in the nutritional support of patients with severe acute pancreatitis, particularly in those who are unable to tolerate enteral nutrition (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Mueller, 2017</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). Nasogastric suction may be used to relieve nausea and vomiting and to decrease painful abdominal distention and paralytic ileus (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Brunicardi, 2019</a>). Research data do not support the routine use of nasogastric tubes to remove gastric secretions in an effort to limit pancreatic secretion. Though current literature discourages the use of acid-suppressive therapy, this practice is common for hospitalized patients. Histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) antagonists such as cimetidine may be prescribed to decrease pancreatic activity by inhibiting secretion of gastric acid. Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole may be used for patients who do not tolerate H<sub>2</sub> antagonists or for whom this therapy is ineffective (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3356">Barbateskovic, Marker, Granholm, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3364">Kavitt, Lipowska, Anyane-Yeboa, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pain Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adequate administration of analgesia is essential during the course of acute pancreatitis to provide sufficient pain relief and to minimize restlessness, which may stimulate pancreatic secretion further. Pain relief may require parenteral opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). The recommendation for pain management is the use of opioids, with assessment for their effectiveness, and altering therapy if pain is not controlled or is increased (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3360">Faghih et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). There is some evidence that implementing the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesia ladder provides a pragmatic approach to pain management in patients with pancreatitis (Z.orniak et al., 2019). This stepwise escalation from low potency to higher potency of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone or in combination with opioids may provide an effective method of pain management and lower the potential for opioid dependency (Z.orniak et al., 2019). NSAIDs must be avoided or used in caution in patients at risk for bleeding. GI paralysis and ileus are common problems in early acute pancreatitis that can be potentiated and aggravated with the use of high-dose opioids (Z.orniak et al., 2019). More research is needed to identify the best option for pain management in the patient with acute pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih et al., 2019</a>). Until evidence-based recommendations are developed, guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting should be followed (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Antiemetic agents may be prescribed to prevent vomiting.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Intensive Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Correction of fluid and blood loss and low albumin levels is necessary to maintain fluid volume and prevent acute kidney injury. The patient is usually acutely ill and is monitored in the intensive care unit, where hemodynamic monitoring and arterial blood gas monitoring are initiated. Antibiotic agents may be prescribed if infection is present. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for patients with acute pancreatitis (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Faghih et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). Insulin may be required if hyperglycemia occurs. Intensive insulin therapy (continuous infusion) in the critically ill patient has undergone much study. The best practice recommendations, which have arisen from many investigations on this complex topic, include targeting a blood glucose level of 140 to 200 mg/dL if insulin therapy is required in critically ill medical and surgical patients. Additionally, clinicians are advised to avoid glucose targets &#x003C;140 mg/dL because adverse effects are likely to increase with lower blood glucose targets (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Horton, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Respiratory Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aggressive respiratory care is indicated because of the high risk of elevation of the diaphragm, pulmonary infiltrates and effusion, and atelectasis. Hypoxemia occurs in a significant number of patients with acute pancreatitis, even with normal x-ray findings. Respiratory care may range from close monitoring of arterial blood gases to the use of humidified oxygen to intubation and mechanical ventilation (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Biliary Drainage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Placement of biliary drains (for external drainage) and stents (indwelling tubes) in the pancreatic duct through endoscopy has been performed to reestablish drainage of the pancreas. This has resulted in decreased pain.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Intervention</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although the acutely ill patient is at high risk for surgical complications, surgery may be performed to assist in the diagnosis of pancreatitis (diagnostic laparotomy); to establish pancreatic drainage; or to resect or d&#x00E9;bride an infected, necrotic pancreas. The patient who undergoes pancreatic surgery may have multiple drains in place postoperatively, as well as a surgical incision that is left open for irrigation and repacking every 2 to 3 days to remove necrotic debris (see <a href="#ff44-6">Fig. 44-6</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Postacute Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Oral feedings that are low in fat and protein are initiated gradually. Caffeine and alcohol are eliminated from the diet. If the episode of pancreatitis occurred during treatment with thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, or oral contraceptives, these medications are discontinued. Follow-up may include ultrasound, x-ray studies, or ERCP to determine whether the pancreatitis is resolving and to assess for abscesses and pseudocysts. ERCP may also be used to identify the cause of acute pancreatitis if it is in question and for endoscopic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1432" title="1432"></span>sphincterotomy and removal of gallstones from the common bile duct.</p>

Triple-lumen tubes consist of ports that provide tubing for irrigation, air venting, and drainage.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1898">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Pain and Discomfort</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because the pathologic process responsible for pain is autodigestion of the pancreas, the objectives of therapy are to relieve pain and decrease secretion of pancreatic enzymes. The pain of acute pancreatitis is often very severe, necessitating the liberal use of analgesic agents. The current recommendation for pain management in this population is parenteral opioids, including morphine, hydromorphone, or fentanyl via patient-controlled analgesia or bolus (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). In patients who are critically ill, a continuous infusion may be needed. Because most opioids stimulate spasm of the sphincter of Oddi to some degree, consensus has not been reached on the most effective agent. Ensuring patient comfort, regardless of the opioid prescribed, is the most essential aspect of care. The nurse frequently assesses the pain level and the effectiveness of the pharmacologic (and nonpharmacologic) interventions. Changes may be needed in the regimen for pain management based on the achievement of pain control. Pain assessment tools (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) are available for the nurse to ensure an accurate rating of pain. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as proper positioning, music, distraction, and imagery may be effective in reducing pain when used along with medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Oral feedings are withheld to decrease the secretion of secretin. Parenteral fluids and electrolytes are prescribed to restore and maintain fluid balance. Nasogastric suction may be used to relieve nausea and vomiting or to treat abdominal distention and paralytic ileus. The nurse provides frequent oral hygiene and care to decrease discomfort from the nasogastric tube and relieve dryness of the mouth.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who is acutely ill is maintained on bed rest to decrease the metabolic rate and reduce the secretion of pancreatic and gastric enzymes. If the patient experiences increasing severity of pain, the nurse reports this to the primary provider because the patient may be experiencing hemorrhage of the pancreas or the dose of analgesic medication may be inadequate.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with acute pancreatitis is often confused or delirious because of severe pain, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and hypoxia. Therefore, the nurse provides frequent and repeated but simple explanations about the need for withholding fluids, maintenance of gastric suction, and bed rest.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Improving Breathing Pattern</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse maintains the patient in a semi-Fowler position to decrease pressure on the diaphragm by a distended abdomen and to increase respiratory expansion. Frequent changes of position are necessary to prevent atelectasis and pooling of respiratory secretions. Pulmonary assessment, including monitoring of pulse oximetry or arterial blood gases, is essential to detect changes in respiratory status so that early treatment can be initiated. The nurse instructs the patient in techniques of coughing and deep breathing and in the use of incentive spirometry to improve respiratory function and assists the patient to perform these activities every hour.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Improving Nutritional Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and notes factors that alter the patient&#x2019;s nutritional requirements (e.g., temperature elevation, surgery, drainage). Laboratory test results and daily weights are useful to monitor the nutritional status.</p>
<p class="indent">Enteral or parenteral nutrition may be prescribed. In addition to administering enteral or parenteral nutrition, the nurse monitors serum glucose levels every 4 to 6 hours. As the acute symptoms subside, oral feedings are gradually reintroduced. Between acute attacks, the patient receives a diet that is high in protein and low in fat (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Goodchild et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Olson et al., 2019</a>). The patient should avoid heavy meals and alcoholic beverages.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Skin Integrity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is at risk for skin breakdown because of poor nutritional status, enforced bed rest, and restlessness, which may result in pressure injuries and breaks in tissue integrity. In addition, the patient who has undergone surgery may have multiple drains or an open surgical incision and is at risk for skin breakdown and infection. The wound, drainage sites, and skin are carefully assessed for signs of infection, inflammation, and breakdown. The nurse carries out wound care as prescribed and takes precautions to protect intact skin from contact with drainage. Consultation with a wound-ostomy-continence (WOC) nurse, a nurse specially educated in appropriate skin, wound, ostomy, and continence care is often helpful in identifying appropriate skin care devices and protocols. The patient must be turned every 2 hours; the use of specialty beds may be indicated to prevent skin breakdown.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid and electrolyte disturbances are common complications because of nausea, vomiting, movement of fluid from the vascular compartment to the peritoneal cavity, diaphoresis, fever, and the use of gastric suction. The nurse assesses <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1433" title="1433"></span>the patient&#x2019;s fluid and electrolyte status by noting skin turgor and moistness of mucous membranes. The nurse weighs the patient daily and carefully measures fluid intake and output, including urine output, nasogastric secretions, and diarrhea. In addition, it is important to assess for other factors that may affect fluid and electrolyte status, including increased body temperature and wound drainage. The patient is assessed for ascites, and abdominal girth is measured daily if ascites is suspected.</p>
<p class="indent">Fluids are administered IV and may be accompanied by infusion of blood or blood products to maintain the blood volume and to prevent or treat hypovolemic shock. Emergency medications must be readily available because of the risk of circulatory collapse and shock. The nurse promptly reports decreased blood pressure and reduced urine output, which indicate hypovolemia and shock or acute kidney injury. Low serum calcium and magnesium levels may occur and require prompt treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Pancreatic necrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis because of resulting hemorrhage, septic shock, and MODS. The patient may undergo diagnostic procedures for confirmation of pancreatic necrosis. If the patient is found to have pancreatic necrosis with infection, this may require surgical, percutaneous or endoscopic d&#x00E9;bridement or insertion of multiple drains. Percutaneous or endoscopic catheter drainage is the first step of what is known as the &#x201C;Step-Up Approach.&#x201D; Catheters are placed via the left or right retroperitoneal approach to drain the infection. D&#x00E9;bridement, if required, may be performed through video-assisted retroperitoneal d&#x00E9;bridement. These interventions, coupled with appropriate, targeted antibiotic therapy, may be the only necessary treatment for some patients (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3371">Paulino, Ramos, &#x0026; Veloso Gomes, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3374">Rashid, Hussain, Jehanzeb, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Sion &#x0026; Davis, 2019</a>; Wolbrink, Kolwijck, Ten Oever, et al., 2019). These procedures are considered first-line approaches, with surgery reserved for patients for whom these interventions do not work. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated (<a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3371">Paulino et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Sion &#x0026; Davis, 2019</a>; <a href="c44-sec14.xhtml#bib3385">Wolbrink et al., 2019</a>). The patient with pancreatic necrosis with or without infection is usually critically ill and requires expert medical and nursing management, including hemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to carefully monitoring vital signs and other signs and symptoms, the nurse is responsible for administering prescribed fluids, medications, and blood products; assisting with supportive management, such as the use of a ventilator; preventing additional complications; and providing physical and psychological care.</p>
<p class="indent">Shock and MODS may occur with acute pancreatitis. Hypovolemic shock may occur as a result of hypovolemia and sequestering of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic shock may occur with hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Septic shock may occur with bacterial infection of the pancreas. Cardiac dysfunction may occur as a result of fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acid&#x2013;base imbalances, and release of toxic substances into the circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse closely monitors the patient for early signs of neurologic, cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory dysfunction and must be prepared to respond quickly to rapid changes in the patient&#x2019;s status, treatments, and therapies. In addition, it is important to inform the family about the patient&#x2019;s status and progress and to allow them to spend time with the patient. Management of shock and MODS is discussed in detail in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">After an episode of acute pancreatitis, the patient is often still weak and debilitated for weeks or months. A prolonged period may be needed to regain strength and return to the previous level of activity. Because of the severity of the acute illness, the patient may not recall education given during the acute phase. Patient education often needs to be repeated and reinforced. The nurse educates the patient about the factors implicated in the onset of acute pancreatitis and about the need to avoid high-fat foods, heavy meals, and alcohol. The patient and family should receive verbal and written instructions about signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis and possible complications that should be reported promptly to the primary provider.</p>
<p class="indent">If acute pancreatitis is a result of biliary tract disease, such as gallstones and gallbladder disease, additional explanations are needed about required dietary modifications. If the pancreatitis is a result of alcohol abuse, the nurse reinforces the need to avoid all alcohol.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A referral for home, community-based or transitional care is often indicated. This enables the nurse to assess the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status and adherence to the therapeutic regimen. The nurse also assesses the home situation and reinforces instructions about fluid and nutrition intake and avoidance of alcohol. Nurses should consider implementing the teach-back method when educating patients and families about this vital information (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> for a discussion of the teach-back method). After the acute attack has subsided, some patients may be inclined to return to their previous drinking habits. The nurse provides specific information about resources and support groups that may be of assistance in avoiding alcohol in the future. Referral to Alcoholics Anonymous as appropriate or other support groups is essential. See the accompanying plan of nursing care in <a href="c44-sec08.xhtml#ct44-4">Chart 44-4</a> for care of the patient with acute pancreatitis.</p>
