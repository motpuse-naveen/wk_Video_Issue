<h4 class="h4" id="s722">Tumors of the Mediastinum</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Tumors of the mediastinum include neurogenic tumors, tumors of the thymus, lymphomas, germ cell tumors, cysts, and mesenchymal tumors. These tumors may be malignant or benign. They are usually described in relation to location: anterior, middle, or posterior masses or tumors.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s723">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nearly all symptoms of mediastinal tumors result from the pressure of the mass against important intrathoracic organs. Symptoms may include cough, wheezing, dyspnea, anterior chest or neck pain, bulging of the chest wall, heart palpitations, angina, other circulatory disturbances, central cyanosis, superior vena cava syndrome (i.e., swelling of the face, neck, and upper extremities), marked distention of the veins of the neck and the chest wall (evidence of the obstruction of large veins of the mediastinum by extravascular compression or intravascular invasion), and dysphagia and weight loss from pressure or invasion into the esophagus (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Berry, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s724">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chest x-rays are the major method used initially to diagnose mediastinal tumors and cysts. A CT scan is the standard diagnostic test for the assessment of the mediastinum and surrounding structures. MRI, as well as PET, may be used in some circumstances (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Berry, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Jeyathevan, G., Lemonde, M., &#x0026; Cooper Brathwaite, A. (2017). The role of oncology nurse navigators in facilitating continuity of care within the diagnostic phase for adult patients with lung cancer. <em>Canadian Oncology Nursing Journal</em>, <em>27</em>(1), 74&#x2013;87.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">An emerging trend in the effective management of cancer care and treatment is the use of nurse navigators. The purpose of this phenomenologic qualitative research study was to explore the effectiveness of the oncology nurse navigator (ONN) in facilitating the care of the patient with lung cancer during the diagnostic period. Through the lens of both the ONN and the patient, the researchers explored the organizational and clinical component of the role and the impact on continuity of care and patient empowerment. This published report focused on continuity of care through the dimensions of informational, management, and relational continuity.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A Bi-Dimensional Framework examining the organization and clinical role of the ONN guided this study. Using a phenomenologic approach, the &#x201C;lived experience&#x201D; of the patient and the ONN were explored. Purposive sampling yielded eight participants, four patients, and four ONNs. Criteria for patient participation in the study included: adults 18 years of age and older, symptoms suspicious of lung cancer, English speaking, and at least two prior contacts with the ONN. Criteria for nurse navigator participation in the study included: certification in oncology nursing, completion of courses specific to lung disease, and employed in the lung cancer diagnostic department as a nurse navigator. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with each participant; in addition, the ONNs participated in a focus group.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Five major themes emerged through an iterative process of thematic analysis from the perspective of the patient with lung cancer and the ONN. Themes identified included: patient focused care, needs assessment, shared decision making, accessibility, and eliminating barriers. These themes correspond to the continuity of care related to informational, management, and relational continuity.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Little is known about the impact of nurse navigators on the patient experience during the diagnostic and cancer treatment periods. This research provides empirical evidence on the importance of this role throughout the diagnostic period of cancer as perceived by both patients and ONNs. Patient-focused care was enhanced through the provision of timely, personalized information which aided in the patients&#x2019; understanding of diagnostic tests and subsequent follow-up. Telephone needs assessment proved to be vital as the ONN explored not only medical symptoms and social aspects, but also included an assessment of cultural concerns prior to the patients&#x2019; first visit to the cancer center. These interactions supported the theme of shared decision making; the participants felt empowered, rather than powerless, as the ONN involved them in their care. Empathy and therapeutic communication were expressed through the theme of accessibility. Participants acknowledged the &#x201C;professional-personal&#x201D; connection with the ONN. Through the trusting relationship that was formed, barriers were eliminated, and all aspects of care could be addressed during this phase of care. This research supports best practice standards for the role of the nurse navigator and provides a framework for continued study in other specialties of care.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s725">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the tumor is malignant and has infiltrated the surrounding tissue and complete surgical removal is not feasible, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both are used.</p>
<p class="indent">Many mediastinal tumors are benign and operable. The location of the tumor (anterior, middle, or posterior compartment) in the mediastinum dictates the type of incision. The common incision used is a median sternotomy; however, a thoracotomy may be used, depending on the location of the tumor. Additional approaches include a bilateral anterior thoracotomy (clamshell incision) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The care is the same as for any patient undergoing thoracic surgery. Major complications include hemorrhage, injury to the phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerve, and infection.</p>
