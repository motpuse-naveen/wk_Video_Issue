<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ileal conduit:&lt;/b&gt; transplantation of the ureters to an isolated section of the terminal ileum, with one end of the ureters brought to the abdominal wall (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; ileal loop)">ileal conduit</button></strong> (ileal loop) is the oldest and most common of the urinary diversion procedures in use because of the low number of complications and the simplicity of the procedure (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Shi et al., 2018</a>) (Fig 49-7). Additional advantages include that it is well known to health care professionals, there is no need for bladder retraining, and no nocturnal incontinence (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Chang &#x0026; Lawrentschuk, 2015</a>).</p>

The surgeon transplants the ureters to an isolated section of the terminal ileum (ileal conduit), bringing one end to the abdominal wall. The ureter may also be transplanted into the transverse sigmoid colon (colon conduit) or proximal jejunum (jejuna conduit).</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">When an ileal conduit surgical procedure is performed, the urine is diverted by implanting the ureter into a 12-cm loop of ileum that is led out through the abdominal wall. This loop of ileum is a simple conduit (passageway) for urine from the ureters to the surface. A loop of the sigmoid colon may also be used. An ileostomy bag is used to collect the urine. The resected (cut) ends of the remaining intestine are anastomosed (connected) to provide an intact bowel (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3605">Wound Ostomy Continence Nurses [WOCN] Society, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Stents, usually made of thin, pliable tubing, are placed in the ureters to prevent occlusion secondary to postsurgical edema (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Yang et al., 2019</a>). The bilateral ureteral stents allow urine to drain from the kidney to the stoma and provide a method for accurate measurement of urine output. They may be left in place 10 to 21 days postoperatively. Jackson&#x2013;Pratt drains or other types of drains are inserted to prevent the accumulation of fluid in the space created by removal of the bladder.</p>
<p class="indent">The outcome for a patient with an ileal conduit depends to a large degree on the location or position of the stoma, whether the drainage device (bag) establishes a watertight seal to the skin, and the patient&#x2019;s ability to manage the appliance.</p>
<p class="indent">After surgery, a skin barrier and a transparent, disposable urinary drainage bag are applied around the conduit and connected to drainage. A custom-cut appliance is used until the edema subsides and the stoma shrinks to normal size. The clear bag allows the stoma to be inspected and the patency of the stent and the urine output to be monitored. The ileal bag drains urine (not feces) continuously. The appliance (bag) usually remains in place as long as it is watertight; it is changed when necessary to prevent leakage of urine.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2256">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications that may follow placement of an ileal conduit include wound infection or wound dehiscence, urinary leakage, ureteral obstruction, hyperchloremic acidosis, small bowel obstruction, ileus, and gangrene of the stoma. Delayed complications include ureteral obstruction, contraction or stenosis (narrowing) of the stoma, kidney deterioration due to chronic reflux, peristomal hernia, retraction, pyelonephritis, renal calculi, and cancer recurrence (WOCN Society, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2257">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the preoperative period, the nurse helps facilitate the marking of the stoma on the abdominal wall as this is associated with decreased complications postoperatively, fewer problems with the fitting of the appliance, and increased quality of life and independence postoperatively (WOCN Society, 2018). Preoperative education is initiated about basic self-care skills for managing the ileal conduit (WOCN Society, 2018). Because the patient requires specialized care, a consultation is initiated with a WOC nurse.</p>
<p class="indent">In the immediate postoperative period, urine volumes are monitored hourly. Throughout the patient&#x2019;s hospitalization, the nurse monitors closely for complications, reports signs and symptoms of them promptly, and intervenes quickly to prevent their progression.</p>
<p class="indent">A urine output below 0.5 mL/kg/h may indicate dehydration or an obstruction in the ileal conduit, with possible <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1629" title="1629"></span>backflow or leakage from the ureteroileal anastomosis. A catheter may be inserted through the urinary conduit to monitor the patient for possible stasis or residual urine from a constricted stoma. Urine may drain through the bilateral ureteral stents as well as around the stents. If the ureteral stents are not draining, the nurse may be instructed to carefully irrigate with 5 to 10 mL sterile normal saline solution, being careful not to exert tension that could dislodge the stent. Hematuria may be noted in the first 48 hours after surgery but usually resolves spontaneously.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Stoma and Skin Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The stoma is inspected frequently for color and viability. A healthy stoma is pink or red. A change from this normal color to purple, brown, or black suggests that the vascular supply may be compromised. If cyanosis and a compromised blood supply persist, surgical intervention may be necessary. The stoma is not sensitive to touch, but the skin around the stoma becomes sensitive if urine or the appliance causes irritation. The skin is inspected for signs of irritation and bleeding of the stoma mucosa, encrustation and skin irritation around the stoma (from alkaline urine coming in contact with exposed skin), rashes, redness, pruritus, or other signs of impairment and wound infections (WOCN Society, 2018).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Caring for the Ostomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Moisture in bed linens or clothing or the odor of urine around the patient should alert the nurse to the possibility of leakage from the appliance, potential infection, or a problem in hygienic management. A properly fitted appliance is essential to prevent exposure of the skin around the stoma to urine (WOCN Society, 2018). If the urine smells foul, the stoma is catheterized, if prescribed, to obtain a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity testing.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Encouraging Fluids and Relieving Anxiety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because mucous membrane is used in forming the conduit, the patient may excrete a large amount of mucus mixed with urine. This causes anxiety in many patients. To help relieve this anxiety, the nurse reassures the patient that this is a normal occurrence after an ileal conduit procedure. The nurse encourages adequate fluid intake to flush the ileal conduit and decrease the accumulation of mucus.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Selecting the Ostomy Appliance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse is instrumental (often with consultation with a WOC nurse) in selecting an appropriate ostomy appliance. The urinary appliance may consist of one or two pieces and may be disposable (usually used once and discarded) or reusable. The choice of appliance is determined by the location of the stoma and by the patient&#x2019;s normal activity, manual dexterity, visual function, body build, economic resources, and preference.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patient education begins in the hospital but continues in the home setting because patients are usually discharged within days of surgery. The nurse educates the patient how to assess and manage the urinary diversion as well as how to deal with changes in body image. A WOC nurse is invaluable in consulting with the nurse on various aspects of care and patient education (WOCN Society, 2018).</p>
<p class="h8">Changing the Appliance</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient and family are educated about how to apply and change the appliance so that they are comfortable carrying out the procedure and can do so proficiently. Ideally, the appliance system is changed before the system leaks and at a time that is convenient for the patient. Many patients find that early morning is most convenient because the urine output is reduced. A variety of appliances are available (WOCN Society, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the type of appliance used, a skin barrier is essential to protect the skin from irritation and excoriation (WOCN Society, 2018). To maintain skin integrity, a skin barrier or leaking pouch is never patched with tape to prevent accumulation of urine under the skin barrier or faceplate. The patient is instructed to avoid moisturizing soaps and body washes when cleaning the area because they interfere with the adhesion of the pouch. The degree to which the stoma protrudes is not the same in all patients; thus, there are various accessories and custom-made appliances to solve individual problems. Patient guidelines for applying reusable and disposable systems are presented in <a href="#ct49-13">Chart&#x00A0;49-13</a>.</p>
<p class="h8">Controlling Odor</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is instructed to avoid foods that give the urine a strong odor (e.g., asparagus, cheese, eggs). Most appliances contain odor barriers, but, if needed, a few drops of liquid deodorizer or diluted white vinegar may be introduced through the drain spout into the bottom of the pouch with a syringe or eyedropper to reduce odors. The patient is reminded that odor will develop if the pouch is worn longer than recommended and not cared for properly (WOCN Society, 2018).</p>
<p class="h8">Managing the Ostomy Appliance</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is instructed to empty the pouch by means of a drain valve when it is one third full because the weight of more urine will cause the pouch to separate from the skin. Some patients prefer wearing a leg bag attached with an adapter to the drainage apparatus. To promote uninterrupted sleep, a collecting bottle and tubing (one unit) are snapped onto an adapter that connects to the ileal appliance. A small amount of urine is left in the bag when the adapter is attached to prevent the bag from collapsing against itself. The tubing may be threaded down the pajama or pants leg to prevent kinking. The collecting bottle and tubing are rinsed daily with cool water and once a week with a 3:1 solution of water and white vinegar.</p>
<p class="h8">Cleaning and Deodorizing the Appliance</p>
<p class="nonindent">Usually, the reusable appliance is rinsed in warm water and soaked in a 3:1 solution of water and white vinegar or a commercial deodorizing solution for 30 minutes. It is rinsed with tepid water and air-dried away from direct sunlight as hot water and exposure to direct sunlight dry the pouch and increase the incidence of cracking. After drying, the appliance <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1630" title="1630"></span>may be powdered with cornstarch and stored. Two appliances are necessary&#x2014;one to be worn while the other is air-drying.</p>

<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Follow-up care is essential to determine how the patient has adapted to the altered body image and lifestyle changes. Referral for home health is indicated to determine how well the patient and family are coping with the urinary drainage diversion. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical status and emotional response. In addition, the nurse assesses the ability of the patient and family to manage the urinary diversion and appliance, reinforces previous education, and provides additional information (e.g., community resources, sources of ostomy supplies, insurance coverage for supplies).</p>
<p class="indent">As the postoperative edema subsides, the nurse assists in determining the appropriate changes needed in the ostomy appliance. The size of the stoma is measured every 3 to 6&#x00A0;weeks for the first few months postoperatively. The correct appliance size is determined by measuring the widest part of the stoma with a ruler. The permanent appliance should be no more than 1.6 mm (1/8 inch) larger than the diameter of the stoma and the same shape as the stoma to prevent contact of the skin with drainage.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient and family about resources (see the Resources section at the end of this chapter). Local chapters of the American Cancer Society (ACS) can provide medical equipment and supplies and other resources for the patient who has undergone ostomy surgery for cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">The home health nurse assesses the patient for potential long-term complications such as ureteral obstruction, strictures, hernias, or deterioration of kidney function (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Yang et al., 2019</a>). The nurse also reinforces previous education about potential complications and self-care management (WOCN Society, 2018).</p>
