<h4 class="h4" id="s2847">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Many diagnostic procedures are available to measure the auditory and vestibular systems indirectly. These tests are usually performed by a certified audiologist. The nurse educates the patient about the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to testing. The nurse notes trends in results because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2848">Audiometry</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In detecting hearing loss, audiometry is the single most important diagnostic instrument. Audiometric testing is of two kinds: pure-tone audiometry, in which the sound stimulus consists of a pure or musical tone (the louder the tone before the patient perceives it, the greater the hearing loss), and speech audiometry, in which the spoken word is used to determine the ability to hear and discriminate sounds and words.</p>
<p class="indent">When evaluating hearing, three characteristics are important: frequency, pitch, and intensity. <em>Frequency</em> refers to the number of sound waves emanating from a source per second, measured as cycles per second, or Hertz. The normal human ear perceives sounds ranging in frequency from 20 to 20,000 Hz. The frequencies from 500 to 2000 Hz are important in understanding everyday speech and are referred to as the speech range or speech frequencies. <em>Pitch</em> is the term used to describe frequency; a tone with 100 Hz is considered of low pitch, and a tone of 10,000 Hz is considered of high pitch.</p>
<p class="indent">The unit for measuring loudness (<em>intensity</em> of sound) is the decibel (dB), the pressure exerted by sound. Hearing loss is measured in decibels&#x2014;a logarithmic function of intensity that is not easily converted into a percentage. The critical level of loudness is approximately 30 dB. The shuffling of papers in quiet surroundings is about 15 dB; a low conversation, 40 dB; and a jet plane 100 feet away, about 150 dB. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1942" title="1942"></span>Sound louder than 80 dB is perceived by the human ear to be harsh and can be damaging to the inner ear. <a href="#tt59-2">Table 59-2</a> classifies hearing loss based on decibel level. In surgical treatment of patients with hearing loss, the aim is to improve the hearing level to 30 dB or better within the speech frequencies.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Nurses&#x2019; Beliefs Toward Deaf and Hard of Hearing Interaction</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Lewis, A., &#x0026; Keele, R. (2020). Development and validation of instrument to measure nurses&#x2019; beliefs toward Deaf and hard of hearing interaction. <em>Journal of Nursing Measurement</em>, <em>28</em>(2). doi: 10.1891/JNM-D-19-00024</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurse&#x2013;patient communication has a significant effect on health outcomes and quality of care. Investigating what nurses believe about interacting with Deaf signers, nonsigning deaf, and hard of hearing patients is an important step in minimizing barriers and improving nursing care. The purpose of this research was to develop and test the validity and reliability of an instrument to measure registered nurses&#x2019; (RNs) beliefs toward interaction with patients who are Deaf signers, nonsigning deaf, and hard of hearing, as well as with certified interpreters.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study used a quantitative methodologic design.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Noteworthy findings were associated with the social constructs of power and control. Participant responses strongly indicated the belief that it is acceptable to relinquish the autonomy and self-determination of a Deaf signer, a nonsigning deaf, or a hard of hearing person to a hearing person. This belief is apparent in at least 65% of respondents from three groups of RNs who agreed that &#x201C;questions or responses for a person who is a Deaf signer, a nonsigning deaf, or hard of hearing should be directed to hearing family members&#x201D; and at least 60% of respondents from both groups of RNs agreed that &#x201C;during health care interactions, most Deaf signers prefer to get by without a certified interpreter.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Data collection and analyses resulted in a 25-item D/deaf and Hard of Hearing Interaction Beliefs Scale for Registered Nurses. Psychometric analysis of two separate groups of data concluded that the newly developed scale is a reliable and valid scale to measure nurses&#x2019; beliefs toward interaction with patients who are either Deaf signers, nonsigning deaf, or hard of hearing. Results of confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized structure of the scale and provided some evidence for its factorial validity.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Understanding the beliefs that nurses hold toward interactions with Deaf signers, nonsigning deaf, and hard of hearing persons may shed light on nurses&#x2019; general beliefs toward individuals who are Deaf signers, nonsigning deaf, and hard of hearing. Furthermore, these beliefs may influence nurses&#x2019; views about the importance of appropriate and effective interaction with patients who have diverse communication needs. This understanding can lead to the development of standards of practice and organizational policies that reflect federal laws mandating equal communication access for all. Attention to equal communication access can create a nursing culture that views communication diversity not as a barrier, but as an opportunity to open doors and promote every patient&#x2019;s right to autonomy and self-determination.</p>

<p class="indent">With audiometry, the patient wears earphones and signals to the audiologist when a tone is heard. When the tone is applied directly over the external auditory canal, air conduction is measured. When the stimulus is applied to the mastoid bone, bypassing the conductive mechanism (i.e., the ossicles), nerve conduction is tested. For accuracy, testing is performed in a soundproof room. Responses are plotted on a graph known as an audiogram, which differentiates conductive from sensorineural hearing loss.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2849">Tympanogram</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A tympanogram, or impedance audiometry, measures middle ear muscle reflex to sound stimulation and compliance of the tympanic membrane by changing the air pressure in a sealed ear canal. Compliance is impaired with middle ear disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2850">Auditory Brain Stem Response Audiometry</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The auditory brain stem response (ABR) audiometry is a detectable electrical potential from cranial nerve VIII and the ascending auditory pathways of the brain stem in response to sound stimulation. Electrodes are placed on the patient&#x2019;s scalp and on each earlobe (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Acoustic stimuli (e.g., clicks) are made in the ear. The resulting electrophysiologic measurements can determine at which decibel level a patient hears and whether there are any impairments along the nerve pathways (e.g., tumor on cranial nerve VIII). Patients are instructed to wash and rinse their hair prior to this study but to avoid applying any other hair product. ABR audiometry assessment should be used in conjunction with behavioral audiometry for the most accurate results (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Bhattacharyya, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2851">Electronystagmography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Electronystagmography is the measurement and graphic recording of the changes in electrical potentials created by eye movements during spontaneous, positional, or calorically evoked nystagmus (see discussion of nystagmus later in this chapter). It is also used to assess the oculomotor and vestibular systems and their corresponding interaction. It helps to diagnose causes of unilateral hearing loss of unknown origin, vertigo, or tinnitus. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1943" title="1943"></span>Any vestibular suppressants, such as caffeine and alcohol, are withheld for 48 hours before testing. Medications such as tranquilizers, stimulants, or antivertigo agents are withheld for 5 days before the test (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4278">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2852">Platform Posturography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Platform posturography is recommended for patients with dizziness and balance disorders (<a href="c59-sec26.xhtml#bib4225">American Academy of Otolaryngology&#x2014;Head and Neck Surgery, 2014</a>). It can be used to determine if a patient&#x2019;s vertigo is worsening or to evaluate a patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. The integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues (i.e., sensory integration) with motor response output and coordination of the lower limbs is tested. The patient stands on a platform, surrounded by a screen, and different conditions such as a moving platform with a moving screen or a stationary platform with a moving screen are presented. The responses from the patient are measured and indicate which of the anatomic systems may be impaired. Preparation for the testing is the same as for electronystagmography.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2853">Sinusoidal Harmonic Acceleration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sinusoidal harmonic acceleration, or a rotary chair, is used to assess the vestibuloocular system by analyzing compensatory eye movements in response to the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the chair. Although such testing cannot identify the side of the lesion in unilateral disease, it helps to identify the disease (e.g., M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease and tumors of the auditory canal) and evaluate the course of recovery. The same patient preparation is required as that for electronystagmography.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2854">Middle Ear Endoscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Using instruments called endoscopes that have very small diameters and acute angles, the ear can be examined by an endoscopist specializing in otolaryngology. Middle ear endoscopy is performed safely and effectively as an office procedure to evaluate suspected perilymphatic fistula and new-onset conductive hearing loss, the anatomy of the round window before transtympanic treatment of M&#x00E9;ni&#x00E8;re&#x2019;s disease, and the tympanic cavity before ear surgery to treat chronic middle ear and mastoid infections.</p>
<p class="indent">The tympanic membrane is anesthetized topically for about 10 minutes before the procedure. Then, the external auditory canal is irrigated with sterile normal saline solution. With the aid of a microscope, a tympanotomy is created with a laser beam or a myringotomy knife so that the endoscope can be inserted into the middle ear cavity. Video and photo documentation can be accomplished through the scope.</p>
