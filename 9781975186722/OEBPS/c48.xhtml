<p class="nonindent">The kidneys and urinary system help regulate the body&#x2019;s internal environment and are essential for the maintenance of life. Nurses working in all clinical settings will encounter patients with various kidney injuries and diseases and need to be knowledgeable about these disorders. This chapter provides an overview of electrolyte imbalances and systemic manifestations that are common in patients with kidney disorders. The main causes are discussed, together with management strategies to prevent damage and preserve renal function. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are discussed, as is the care of patients with other renal conditions requiring dialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), transplantation, and kidney surgery.</p>
