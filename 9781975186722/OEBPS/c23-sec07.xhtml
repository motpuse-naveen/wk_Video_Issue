<p class="nonindent">Advances in diagnostics, medical management, and surgical and anesthesia techniques, as well as the care provided in critical care and surgical units, home care, and rehabilitation programs, have continued to make surgery an effective treatment option for patients with CAD. CAD has been treated by myocardial revascularization since the 1960s, and the most common CABG techniques have been performed for more than 40 years. <strong>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)</strong> is a surgical procedure in which a blood vessel is grafted to an occluded coronary artery so that blood can flow beyond the occlusion; it is also called a <em>bypass graft.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The major indications for CABG are:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Alleviation of angina that cannot be controlled with medication or PCI</span></li>
<li><span>Treatment for left main coronary artery stenosis or multivessel CAD</span></li>
<li><span>Prevention of and treatment for MI, arrhythmias, or heart failure</span></li>
<li><span>Treatment for complications from an unsuccessful PCI</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The recommendation for CABG is determined by a number of factors, including the number of diseased coronary vessels, the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, the presence of other health problems, the patient&#x2019;s symptoms, and any previous treatment. CABG and PCI have shown similar results in outcomes, such as MI rate, mortality, and improvement of angina post-intervention. However, the requirement of a second reperfusion intervention has been shown to be lower with CABG compared to PCI therapy (<a href="#bib1787">Gaudino, Spadaccio, &#x0026; Taggart, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">CABG is performed less frequently in women (<a href="#bib1748">Angraal, Khera, Wang, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Compared with men, women referred for this surgery tend to be older and have more comorbidities such as diabetes. In addition, they have a higher risk of surgical complications and increased mortality (<a href="#bib1748">Angraal et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Although some women have good outcomes following CABG, men generally have a better rate of graft patency and symptom relief.</p>
<p class="indent">For a patient to be considered for CABG, the coronary arteries to be bypassed must have at least a 70% occlusion, or at least a 50% occlusion in the left main coronary artery (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If significant blockage is not present, flow through the artery will compete with flow through the bypass, and circulation to the ischemic area of myocardium may not improve. The artery also must be patent beyond the area of blockage or the flow through the bypass will be impeded.</p>
<p class="indent">Current guidelines recommend use of the internal thoracic arteries (formerly called the internal mammary arteries) for CABG, because of their histologic characteristics and increased production of vasoactive molecules and anti-inflammatory cytokines which improve arterial patency. Recent studies demonstrate increased survival when using internal thoracic artery grafting. The left internal thoracic artery graft has been shown to have greater than 90% patency after 20 years and is the recommended conduit to use first (<a href="#bib1758">Gaudino et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Arterial grafts are preferred to venous grafts because they do not develop atherosclerotic changes as quickly and remain patent longer. The surgeon leaves the proximal end of the thoracic artery intact and detaches the distal end of the artery from the chest wall. This end of the artery is then grafted to the coronary artery distal to the occlusion. The internal thoracic arteries may not be long enough to use for multiple bypasses. Because of this, many CABG procedures are performed with a combination of venous and arterial grafts.</p>
<p class="indent">A vein commonly used for CABG is the greater saphenous vein, followed by the lesser saphenous vein (see <a href="#ff23-8">Fig. 23-8</a>). The vein is removed from the leg and grafted to the ascending aorta and to the coronary artery distal to the lesion. Traditionally, a skin incision was made over the length of vein <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page749" title="749"></span>segment, but new techniques allow small leg incisions. Endovascular methods of vein harvesting have reduced complications such as infection and wound dehiscence, which are associated with longer leg incisions (<a href="#bib1758">Gaudino et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Lower extremity edema continues to be a common adverse effect of vein removal. The degree of edema varies and usually diminishes over time. The patency of vein grafts can be limited. Within 5 to 10 years, atherosclerotic changes often develop in saphenous vein grafts.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s857">Traditional Coronary Artery Bypass Graft</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CABG procedures are performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the traditional CABG procedure, the surgeon performs a median sternotomy and connects the patient to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. Next, a blood vessel from another part of the patient&#x2019;s body (e.g., saphenous vein, left internal thoracic artery) is grafted distal to the coronary artery lesion, bypassing the obstruction (see <a href="#ff23-9">Fig. 23-9</a>). CPB is then discontinued, chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires are placed, and the incision is closed. The patient is then admitted to a critical care unit.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiopulmonary Bypass</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many cardiac surgical procedures are possible because of CPB (i.e., extracorporeal circulation). The procedure mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. CPB maintains perfusion to body organs and tissues and allows the surgeon to complete the anastomoses in a motionless, bloodless surgical field.</p>
<p class="indent">CPB is accomplished by placing a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. The cannula is connected to tubing filled with an isotonic crystalloid solution. Venous blood removed from the body by the cannula is filtered, oxygenated, cooled or warmed by the machine, and then returned to the body. The cannula used to return the oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, or it may be inserted in the femoral artery (see <a href="#ff23-10">Fig. 23-10</a>). The heart is stopped by the injection of a potassium-rich cardioplegia solution into the coronary arteries. The patient receives heparin to prevent clotting and thrombus formation in the bypass circuit when blood comes in contact with the surfaces of the tubing. At the end of the procedure when the patient is disconnected from the bypass machine, protamine sulfate is given to reverse the effects of heparin.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff23-9">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff23-9.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff23-9.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;23-9 &#x2022;</span> Coronary artery bypass grafts. One or more procedures may be performed using various veins and arteries. <strong>A.</strong> Left internal thoracic artery (formerly called the left internal mammary artery), used frequently because of its functional longevity. <strong>B.</strong> Saphenous vein, also used as bypass graft.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">During the procedure, hypothermia is maintained at a temperature of about 28&#x00B0;C (82.4&#x00B0;F) (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body&#x2019;s basal metabolic rate, thereby decreasing the demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood. When the surgical procedure is completed, the blood is rewarmed as it passes through the CPB circuit. Urine output, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page750" title="750"></span>and coagulation studies are monitored to assess the patient&#x2019;s status during CPB.</p>

The pump system creates a vacuum, pulling blood into the venous reservoir. The blood is cleared of air bubbles, clots, and particulates by the filter and then is passed through the oxygenator, releasing carbon dioxide and obtaining oxygen. Next, the blood is pulled to the pump and pushed out to the heat exchanger, where its temperature is regulated. The blood is then returned to the body via the ascending aorta.</p></figcaption>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s858">Alternative Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Techniques</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A number of alternative CABG techniques have been developed that may have fewer complications for some groups of patients. Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery has been used successfully in many patients. OPCAB involves a standard median sternotomy incision, but the surgery is performed without CPB. A beta-adrenergic blocker may be used to slow the heart rate. The surgeon also uses a myocardial stabilization device to hold the site still for the anastomosis of the bypass graft into the coronary artery while the heart continues to beat (see <a href="#ff23-11">Fig. 23-11</a>). Research suggests that OPCAB is associated with reduced short-term postoperative morbidity, including stroke and other complications. However, with on-pump CABG, graft patency rate is higher and long-term mortality may be lower (<a href="#bib1758">Gaudino et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Minimally invasive surgical techniques that eliminate median sternotomy have also been developed. These endoscopic techniques use smaller incisions via a right or left thoracotomy approach and a robotic system to place bypass grafts. The patient may or may not require CPB (<a href="#bib1787">Snyder, 2018</a>). Minimally invasive heart surgery may be considered an acceptable alternative to conventional CABG for select patients, such as those who do not require bypass grafts to several vessels. It is most commonly used to bypass occlusions in the left anterior descending artery (<a href="#bib1787">Snyder, 2018</a>). It has allowed patients to recover earlier, require fewer blood transfusions, experience fewer respiratory complications, and be less likely to experience acute kidney injury (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The most important criterion when deciding whether a patient needs a CABG or a PCI is the predicted surgical mortality, which takes into consideration the patient&#x2019;s individual characteristics, the anatomic complexity of the coronary lesions, and the ability to achieve revascularization. The cardiac surgeon will assess the following factors to determine risk and the ability to revascularize: clinical history (age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, left ventricular function, arrhythmias), previous cardiovascular events (previous cardiovascular surgery, PCI, MI, or stroke), and disease complexity (number of diseased vessels, concomitant valve disease). In some cases, CABG may still be recommended over PCI for only one lesion to achieve better revascularization (<a href="#bib1758">Gaudino et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s859">Complications of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CABG may result in complications such as hemorrhage, arrhythmias, and MI (see <a href="#tt23-4">Table 23-4</a>). The patient may require interventions for more than one complication at a time. Collaboration among nurses, physicians, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and dietitians is necessary to achieve the desired patient outcomes. Although most patients improve symptomatically following surgery, CABG is not a cure for CAD, and angina, exercise intolerance, or other symptoms experienced before CABG may recur. Medications required before surgery may need to be continued. Lifestyle modifications recommended before surgery remain important to treat the underlying CAD and for the continued viability of the newly implanted grafts.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s860"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac surgery patients have many of the same needs and require the same perioperative care as other surgical patients (see Unit 3), as well as some special needs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preoperative Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Comprehensive preoperative medical management prevents complications and improves outcomes. This is particularly important because patients undergoing CABG surgery tend to be older and often have multiple comorbidities. The use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins during the preoperative period is associated with better outcomes. Preoperative use of aspirin is associated with a reduction in perioperative morbidity and mortality (<a href="#bib1747">Aboul-Hassan, Stankowski, Marczak, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Beta-blockers, when given at least 24 hours before CABG, reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Perioperative use of statins has been shown to reduce the rates of postoperative MI, atrial fibrillation, neurologic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, infection, and death (<a href="#bib1764">Katsiki, Triposkiadis, Giannoukas, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Assessing the Patient</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are frequently admitted to the hospital the day of the procedure. Therefore, most of the preoperative evaluation is completed in the physician&#x2019;s office and during preadmission testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing and medical personnel perform a history and physical examination. Preoperative testing consists of a chest x-ray; ECG; laboratory tests, including coagulation studies; and blood typing and cross-matching. The preoperative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page751" title="751"></span>history and health assessment should be thorough and well documented because they provide a basis for postoperative comparison. The nurse assesses the patient for disorders that could complicate or affect the postoperative course, such as diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease.</p>

<p class="indent">The health assessment focuses on obtaining baseline physiologic, psychological, and social information. Cognitive status is carefully assessed, as patients with impaired cognitive status will need more assistance after surgery and may require subacute care prior to returning home. Older adults are at a high risk for suffering adverse cognitive outcomes following cardiac surgery (<a href="#bib1762">Jones, Matalanis, M&#x00E5;rtensson, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s education needs are identified and addressed. Of particular importance are the patient&#x2019;s usual functional level, coping mechanisms, and available support systems. These factors affect the patient&#x2019;s postoperative course, discharge plans, and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="indent">The status of the cardiovascular system is determined by reviewing the patient&#x2019;s symptoms, including past and present experiences with chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, intermittent claudication (leg pain that occurs with walking), and peripheral edema. The patient&#x2019;s history of major illnesses; previous surgeries; medication; and the use of illicit and over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, alcohol, and tobacco is also obtained. Particular attention is paid to blood glucose control in patients with diabetes because there is a higher incidence of postoperative complications when glycemic control is poor (<a href="#bib1759">Gordon, Lauver, &#x0026; Buck, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The psychosocial assessment and the assessment of the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s learning needs are also important. Anticipation of cardiac surgery is a source of great stress to the patient and family, and patients with high anxiety levels have poorer outcomes (<a href="#bib1774">Ramesh, Nayak, Pai, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). However, some anxiety is expected, and the work of worrying <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page753" title="753"></span>can help patients identify priorities and find coping strategies that help them face the threat of surgery. Questions may be asked to obtain the following information:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Knowledge and understanding of the surgical procedure, postoperative course, and recovery</span></li>
<li><span>Fears and concerns regarding the surgery and future health status</span></li>
<li><span>Coping mechanisms helpful to the patient</span></li>
<li><span>Support systems available during and following hospitalization</span></li></ul>
<p class="h7">Reducing Fear and Anxiety</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse gives the patient and family time and opportunity to express their fears. Topics of concern may be pain, changes in body image, fear of the unknown, and fear of disability or death. It may be helpful to describe the sensations that the patient can expect, including the preoperative sedation, surgical anesthesia, and postoperative pain management. The nurse reassures the patient that the fear of pain is normal, that some pain will be experienced, that medication to relieve pain will be provided, and that the patient will be closely monitored. In addition, the nurse instructs the patient to request analgesic medication before the pain becomes severe. If the patient has concerns about scarring from surgery, the nurse encourages them to discuss this issue and corrects any misconceptions. The patient and family may want to discuss their fear of the patient dying. After the fear is expressed, the nurse can assure the patient and family that this fear is normal and further explore their feelings. For patients with extreme anxiety or fear and for whom emotional support and education are not successful, antianxiety medication such as lorazepam may be helpful.</p>
<p class="h7">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Angina may occur because of increased stress and anxiety related to the forthcoming surgery. The patient who develops angina usually responds to typical therapy for angina, most commonly nitroglycerin. Some patients require oxygen and IV nitroglycerin infusions. Physiologically unstable patients may require preoperative management in a critical care unit.</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Providing Patient Education</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to surgery, patients and their families are given specific instructions. This includes information on how the patient should take or stop specific medications, including anticoagulant agents, antihypertensive medications, and medications that control diabetes. The patient is instructed to shower with an antiseptic solution such as chlorhexidine gluconate and to apply mupirocin calcium 2% ointment to each nostril to help reduce the risk of surgical site infections (<a href="#bib1775">Reiser, Scherag, Forstner, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Cardiac surgical infections are often caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> which is found in the nasal passages. Studies have shown that decolonizing the nasal passage preoperatively is effective in reducing sternal wound infections associated with cardiac surgery (<a href="#bib1768">Lemaignen, Armand-Lefevre, Birgand, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> for further discussion of preoperative preparation).</p>
<p class="indent">Education also includes information about the hospitalization and surgery. The nurse informs the patient and family about the equipment, tubes, and lines that will be present after surgery and their purposes. They should expect monitors, several IV lines, chest tubes, and a urinary catheter. Explaining the purpose and the approximate time that these devices will be in place helps reassure the patient. Most patients remain intubated and on mechanical ventilation for several hours after surgery. It is important for patients to know that this will prevent them from talking, and the nurse should reassure them that the staff will be able to assist them with other means of communication.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse takes care to answer the patient&#x2019;s questions about postoperative care and procedures. After the nurse explains deep breathing and coughing, the use of the incentive spirometer, and foot exercises, the nurse practices these procedures with the patient. The benefit of early and frequent ambulation is discussed. The family&#x2019;s questions at this time usually focus on the length of the surgery, who will discuss the results of the procedure with them after surgery, where to wait during the surgery, the visiting procedures for the critical care unit, and how they can support the patient before surgery and in the critical care unit.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intraoperative Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The perioperative nurse performs assessments and prepares the patient as described in Chapters 14 and 15. In addition to assisting with the surgical procedure, perioperative nurses are responsible for the comfort and safety of the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Possible intraoperative complications include low cardiac output, arrhythmias, hemorrhage, MI, organ failure from shock, and thromboembolic events including stroke (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Astute intraoperative nursing assessment is critical to prevent, detect, and initiate prompt intervention for these complications. Before the chest incision is closed, chest tubes are inserted to evacuate air and drainage from the mediastinum and the thorax.</p>
<div class="conceptn">

</div>
<p class="indent">Temporary epicardial pacemaker electrodes may be implanted on the surface of the right atrium and the right ventricle. These epicardial electrodes can be connected to an external pacemaker if the patient has persistent bradycardia perioperatively (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> for a discussion of pacemakers).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Postoperative Nursing Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Initial postoperative care focuses on achieving or maintaining hemodynamic stability and recovery from general anesthesia. Care may be provided in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or ICU. The immediate postoperative period for the patient who has undergone cardiac surgery presents many challenges to the health care team. All efforts are made to facilitate the transition from the operating room to the ICU or PACU with minimal risk. Specific information about the surgical procedure and important factors about postoperative management are communicated by the surgical team and anesthesia personnel to the critical care or PACU nurse, who then assumes responsibility for the patient&#x2019;s care. <a href="#ff23-12">Figure 23-12</a> presents an overview of the many aspects of postoperative care of the cardiac surgical patient.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">After the patient&#x2019;s cardiac status and respiratory status are stable, the patient is transferred to a surgical progressive care unit with telemetry. Care in both the ICU and progressive care unit focuses on monitoring of cardiopulmonary status, pain management, wound care, progressive activity, and nutrition. Education about medications and risk factor modification is emphasized.</p>
<p class="indent">A typical plan of postoperative nursing care is presented in <a href="#ct23-11">Chart 23-11</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Assessing the Patient</p>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient is admitted to the critical care unit or PACU, nursing and medical personnel perform a complete assessment of all systems at least every 4 hours. It is necessary to assess the following parameters:</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Neurologic status:</em> level of responsiveness, pupil size and reaction to light, facial symmetry, movement of the extremities, and hand grip strength</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Cardiac status:</em> heart rate and rhythm, heart sounds, pacemaker status, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP); in select patients, hemodynamic parameters: pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), cardiac output and index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, mixed venous oxygen saturation (Sv&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub>). A pulmonary artery catheter is often used to monitor these parameters. Alternatively, minimally invasive monitoring of stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac output are calculated through pressures obtained in the arterial line (e.g., Vigileo monitor with FloTrac sensor). (See <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a> for a detailed description of hemodynamic monitoring.)</p>

(See Chapters 17 and 19 for detailed descriptions of respiratory assessment and ventilatory management, respectively.)</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Peripheral vascular status:</em> peripheral pulses; color of skin, nail beds, mucosa, lips, and earlobes; skin temperature; edema; condition of dressings and invasive lines</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Renal function:</em> urinary output; serum creatinine and electrolytes</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Fluid and electrolyte status:</em> strict intake and output, including all IV fluids and blood products, output from all drainage tubes; clinical and laboratory indicators of imbalance</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Pain:</em> nature, type, location, and duration; apprehension; response to analgesics</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment also includes checking all equipment and tubes to ensure that they are functioning properly: endotracheal tube, ventilator, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitor, SpO<sub>2</sub> monitor, pulmonary artery catheter, Sv&#x2013;O<sub>2</sub> monitor, arterial and IV lines, IV infusion devices and tubing, cardiac monitor, pacemaker, chest tubes, and urinary drainage system.</p>
<p class="indent">As the patient regains consciousness and progresses through the postoperative period, the nurse also assesses indicators of psychological and emotional status. The patient may exhibit behavior that reflects denial or depression or may experience postoperative delirium. Characteristic signs of delirium include transient perceptual illusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and paranoid delusions. Patients who have delirium after cardiac surgery have poorer outcomes than do similar patients without this complication (<a href="#bib1762">Jones et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The family&#x2019;s needs also must be assessed. The nurse ascertains how family members are coping with the situation; determines their psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs; and finds out whether they are receiving adequate information about the patient&#x2019;s condition.</p>
<p class="h7">Monitoring for Complications</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is continuously assessed for impending complications (see <a href="#tt23-4">Table 23-4</a>). The nurse and the surgical team function collaboratively to prevent complications, to identify early signs and symptoms of complications, and to institute measures to reverse their progression.</p>
<p class="h8">Decreased Cardiac Output</p>
<p class="nonindent">A decrease in cardiac output is always a threat to the patient who has had cardiac surgery, and it can have a variety of causes. Preload alterations occur when too little blood volume returns to the heart as a result of persistent bleeding and hypovolemia. Excessive postoperative bleeding can lead to decreased intravascular volume, hypotension, and low cardiac output. Bleeding problems are common after cardiac surgery because of the effects of CPB, trauma from the surgery, and anticoagulation. Preload can also decrease if there is a collection of fluid and blood in the pericardium (cardiac tamponade), which impedes cardiac filling. Cardiac output is also altered if too much volume returns to the heart, causing fluid overload.</p>
<p class="indent">Afterload alterations occur when the arteries are constricted as a result of postoperative hypertension or hypothermia, increasing the workload of the heart. Heart rate alterations from bradycardia, tachycardia, and arrhythmias can lead to decreased cardiac output, and contractility can be altered in cardiac failure, MI, electrolyte imbalances, and hypoxia.</p>
<p class="h8">Fluid Volume and Electrolyte Imbalance</p>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may occur after cardiac surgery. Nursing assessment for these complications includes monitoring of intake and output, weight, hemodynamic parameters, hematocrit levels, neck vein distention, edema, breath sounds (e.g., fine crackles, wheezing), and electrolyte levels. The nurse reports changes in serum electrolytes promptly so that treatment can be instituted. Especially important are dangerously high or dangerously low levels of potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. Elevated blood glucose levels are common in the postoperative period. Administration of IV insulin is recommended in patients both with and without diabetes to achieve the glycemic control necessary to promote wound healing, decrease infection, and improve survival after surgery (<a href="#bib1759">Gordon et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Implementing an insulin infusion protocol that targets moderate glycemic control has been demonstrated as effective in treating acute hyperglycemia following cardiac surgery while also decreasing the incidence of hypoglycemia (<a href="#bib1759">Gordon et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Impaired Gas Exchange</p>
<p class="nonindent">Impaired gas exchange is another possible complication after cardiac surgery. All body tissues require an adequate supply of oxygen for survival. To achieve this after surgery, an endotracheal tube with ventilator assistance may be used for hours to days. The assisted ventilation is continued until the patient&#x2019;s blood gas values are acceptable and the patient demonstrates the ability to breathe independently. Patients who are stable after surgery may be extubated as early as 2 to 4 hours after surgery, which reduces their discomfort and anxiety and facilitates patient&#x2013;nurse communication.</p>
<p class="indent">While receiving mechanical ventilation, the patient is continuously assessed for signs of impaired gas exchange: restlessness, anxiety, cyanosis of mucous membranes and peripheral tissues, tachycardia, and fighting the ventilator. Breath sounds are assessed often to detect pulmonary congestion and monitor lung expansion. Arterial blood gases, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> are assessed for decreased oxygen and increased CO<sub>2</sub>. Following extubation, aggressive pulmonary interventions such as turning, coughing, deep breathing, and early ambulation are necessary to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia.</p>
<p class="h8">Impaired Cerebral Circulation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoperfusion or microemboli during or following cardiac surgery may produce injury to the brain. Brain function depends on a continuous supply of oxygenated blood. The brain does not have the capacity to store oxygen and must rely on adequate continuous perfusion by the heart. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page760" title="760"></span>nurse observes the patient for signs and symptoms of cerebral hypoxia: restlessness, confusion, dyspnea, hypotension, and cyanosis. An assessment of the patient&#x2019;s neurologic status includes the level of consciousness, response to verbal commands and painful stimuli, pupil size and reaction to light, facial symmetry, movement of the extremities, and hand grip strength. The nurse documents any indication of a change in status and reports abnormal findings to the surgeon because they may signal the onset of a complication such as a stroke.</p>
<p class="h7">Maintaining Cardiac Output</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ongoing evaluation of the patient&#x2019;s cardiac status continues as the nurse monitors the effectiveness of cardiac output through clinical observations and routine measurements: serial readings of blood pressure, heart rate, CVP, arterial pressure, and pulmonary artery pressures.</p>
<p class="indent">Renal function is related to cardiac function, as blood pressure and cardiac output drive glomerular filtration; therefore, urinary output is measured and recorded. Urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h may indicate a decrease in cardiac output or inadequate fluid volume.</p>
<p class="indent">Body tissues depend on adequate cardiac output to provide a continuous supply of oxygenated blood to meet the changing demands of the organs and body systems. Because the buccal mucosa, nail beds, lips, and earlobes are sites with rich capillary beds, they are observed for cyanosis or duskiness as possible signs of reduced cardiac output. Distention of the neck veins when the head of the bed is elevated to 30 degrees or more may signal right-sided heart failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Arrhythmias may develop due to decreased perfusion to or irritation of the myocardium from surgery. The most common arrhythmias encountered during the postoperative period are atrial fibrillation, bradycardias, tachycardias, and ectopic beats (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Continuous observation of the cardiac monitor for arrhythmias is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse reports any indications of decreased cardiac output promptly. The assessment data are used to determine the cause of the problem. After a diagnosis has been made, the primary provider and the nurse work collaboratively to restore cardiac output and prevent further complications. When indicated, blood components; fluids; and antiarrhythmics, diuretics, vasodilators, or vasopressors are prescribed. If additional interventions are necessary, such as the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump, the patient and family are prepared for the procedure.</p>
<p class="h7">Promoting Adequate Gas Exchange</p>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure adequate gas exchange, the patency of the endotracheal tube is assessed and maintained. The tube must be secured to prevent it from slipping out or down into the right mainstem bronchus. Suctioning is necessary when crackles or coughing is present.</p>
<div class="conceptn">
<p class="CMAT" id="box760"><em><img class="m" src="images/icon15.png" alt=""/><br/>For the procedural guideline for performing tracheal suction, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Arterial blood gas determinations are compared with baseline data, and changes are reported to the primary provider promptly.</p>
<p class="indent">When the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic parameters stabilize, body position is changed every 1 to 2 hours. Frequent changes of patient position provide for optimal pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, allowing the lungs to expand more fully.</p>
<p class="indent">Physical assessment and arterial blood gas results guide the process of weaning the patient from the ventilator. The nurse assists with the weaning process and eventually with the removal of the endotracheal tube. After extubation, the nurse encourages deep breathing and coughing at least every 1 to 2 hours to clear secretions, open the alveolar sacs, and promote effective ventilation. See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for discussion of weaning the patient from the ventilator.</p>
<p class="h7">Maintaining Fluid and Electrolyte Balance</p>
<p class="nonindent">To promote fluid and electrolyte balance, the nurse carefully assesses the intake and output to determine positive or negative fluid balance. It is necessary to record all fluid intake, including IV, nasogastric tube, and oral fluids, as well as all output, including urine, nasogastric drainage, and chest drainage.</p>
<p class="indent">Hemodynamic parameters (e.g., blood pressure, CVP, cardiac output) are correlated with intake, output, and weight to determine the adequacy of hydration and cardiac output. Serum electrolytes are monitored, and the patient is observed for signs of potassium, magnesium, sodium, or calcium imbalance (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Indications of dehydration, fluid overload, or electrolyte imbalance are reported promptly, and the primary provider and nurse work collaboratively to restore fluid and electrolyte balance and monitor the patient&#x2019;s response to therapies.</p>
<p class="h7">Minimizing Confusion</p>
<p class="nonindent">Some patients exhibit abnormal behaviors and acute confusion that occur with varying intensity and duration. The risk of delirium is high in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and increases with patients&#x2019; age (Jones et&#x00A0;al., 2019; Smulter, Lingehall, Gustafson, et&#x00A0;al., 2019; see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct23-12">Chart 23-12</a>). Clinical manifestations of postoperative delirium include restlessness, agitation, visual and auditory hallucinations, and paranoia. The delirium typically appears after a 2- to 5-day stay in an ICU. Patients are assessed for this problem with tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) (<a href="#bib1773">Price, Garvan, Hizel, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c08-sec03.xhtml#ct8-7">Chapter 8, Chart 8-7</a>, for discussion of CAM). The CAMU-ICU scale assesses for key indicators of delirium such as disorganized thinking and inattention. When this testing is positive, further assessment of the patient&#x2019;s physiologic and psychological status is required. Presumed causes of postoperative delirium include anxiety, sleep deprivation, increased sensory input, medications, and physiologic problems such as hypoxemia and metabolic imbalance (<a href="#bib1752">Blair, Mehmood, Rudnick, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Treatment includes correction of identified physiologic problems such as metabolic and electrolyte imbalances. In addition, behavioral interventions are used (e.g., frequent reorientation). Sedative medications such as haloperidol were once thought to reduce agitation and improve survival, but recent studies note that use of haloperidol causes oversedation and does not reliably treat or prevent delirium (<a href="#bib1752">Blair et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The delirium often resolves after the patient is transferred from the unit, but nonetheless can be associated with negative outcomes including cognitive and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page761" title="761"></span>functional decline, longer lengths of hospital stay, and higher mortality (<a href="#bib1787">Delaney, Hammond, &#x0026; Litton, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Use of a Postoperative Delirium Screening Scale in Older Adults After Cardiac Surgery</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Smulter, N., Lingehall, H. C., Gustafson, Y., et&#x00A0;al. (2019). The use of a screening scale improves the recognition of delirium in older patients after cardiac surgery: A retrospective observational study. <em>Journal of Clinical Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>28</em>(11-12), 2309&#x2013;2318.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent occurrence in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, it is often not recognized by health care providers and therefore may go undiagnosed. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the use of a delirium screening tool by nurses postoperatively will improve the recognition and diagnosis of POD.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This study was a retrospective observational analysis. Seventy eight patients aged 70 and older who had cardiac surgery were diagnosed with POD. Nurses used the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) to screen for delirium symptoms. This scale uses five items to assess for delirium: disorientation, inappropriate behavior, inappropriate communication, illusions and hallucinations, and psychomotor retardation. Each item is graded from 0 to 2 with a maximum score of 10. A Nu-DESC score of 2 or greater is thought to indicate the presence of delirium. The screening was conducted three times daily, beginning post-op day 1 through discharge.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Data describing the incidence and nature of POD from the clinical database and discharge summaries were retrospectively collected. This information was compared to the results of symptom screening using the Nu-DESC.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">POD was correctly identified in 41 of 78 (52.6%) patients. &#x201C;Inappropriate behavior&#x201D; was the most common descriptor used by nurses and physicians within discharge summaries. Terminology like &#x201C;confused,&#x201D; &#x201C;aggressive/restless,&#x201D; and &#x201C;disoriented&#x201D; were commonly used to describe delirium symptoms. The cause and specific treatment of delirium was not addressed within the discharge summaries</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Screening using the Nu-DESC identified 56 of 78 (72%) patients with POD. Use of the Nu-DESC showed greater sensitivity in identifying symptoms of delirium than the information documented within the discharge summaries and database.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Delirium is a serious complication that is underdiagnosed in patients after cardiac surgery and, when present, not well documented. Use of a validated screening scale, such as the Nu-DESC, can improve the ability of nurses to recognize delirium in postoperative patients.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">For all postoperative patients, basic comfort measures are used in conjunction with prescribed analgesics and sedatives to promote rest. Invasive lines and tubes are discontinued as soon as possible. Patient care is coordinated to provide undisturbed periods of rest. As the patient&#x2019;s condition stabilizes and the patient is disturbed less frequently for monitoring and therapeutic procedures, rest periods can be extended. Uninterrupted sleep is provided as much as possible, especially during the patient&#x2019;s normal hours of sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">Careful explanations of all procedures and of the patient&#x2019;s role in facilitating them help keep the patient positively involved throughout the postoperative course. Continuity of care is desirable; a familiar face and a nursing staff with a consistent approach help the patient feel safe. The patient&#x2019;s family should be welcomed at the bedside. A well-designed and individualized plan of nursing care can assist the nursing team in coordinating its efforts for the emotional well-being of the patient.</p>
<p class="h7">Relieving Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who have had cardiac surgery may have pain in the peri-incisional area or throughout the chest, shoulders, and back. Pain results from trauma to the chest wall and irritation of the pleura by the chest tubes as well as incisional pain from peripheral vein or artery graft harvest sites.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses patients for verbal and nonverbal indicators of pain and records the nature, type, location, and duration of the pain. To reduce the amount of pain, the nurse encourages the patient to accept medication on a regular basis. The addition of adjunctive pain relievers (anti-inflammatory agents, muscle relaxants) to opioids decreases the amount of opioids required for pain relief and increases patient comfort. Patients report the most pain during coughing, turning, and moving. Physical support of the incision with a folded bath blanket or small pillow during deep breathing and coughing helps minimize pain. The patient should then be able to participate in respiratory exercises and to progressively increase self-care. Patient comfort improves after removal of the chest tubes.</p>
<p class="indent">Pain produces distress, which may stimulate the central nervous system to release catecholamines, resulting in constriction of the arterioles and increased heart rate. This can cause increased afterload and decreased cardiac output. Opioids alleviate pain and induce sleep and feelings of well-being, which reduce the metabolic rate and oxygen demands. After the administration of opioids, it is necessary to document observations indicating relief of apprehension and pain in the patient&#x2019;s record. The nurse observes the patient for any adverse effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, ileus, or urinary retention. If respiratory depression occurs, an opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone) may be required (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion of nonpharmacologic pain interventions).</p>
<p class="h7">Maintaining Adequate Tissue Perfusion</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse routinely palpates peripheral pulses (e.g., pedal, tibial, femoral, radial, brachial) to assess for arterial obstruction. If a pulse is absent in any extremity, the cause may be prior catheterization of that extremity, chronic peripheral vascular disease, or a thromboembolic obstruction. The nurse immediately reports newly identified absence of any pulse.</p>
<p class="indent">Thromboembolic events can result from vascular injury, dislodgment of a clot from a damaged valve, loosening of mural thrombi, or coagulation problems. Air embolism can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page762" title="762"></span>result from CPB or central venous cannulation. Symptoms of embolization vary according to site. The usual embolic sites are the lungs, coronary arteries, mesentery, spleen, extremities, kidneys, and brain. The patient is observed for the onset of the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Acute onset of chest pain and respiratory distress, as occur in pulmonary embolus or MI</span></li>
<li><span>Abdominal or back pain, as occur in mesenteric emboli</span></li>
<li><span>Pain, cessation of pulses, blanching, numbness, or coldness in an extremity</span></li>
<li><span>One-sided weakness and pupillary changes, as occur in stroke</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The nurse promptly reports any of these symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">Venous stasis, which can cause venous thromboembolism (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), may occur after surgery. It can be prevented by using the following measures:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Apply sequential pneumatic compression devices as prescribed.</span></li>
<li><span>Discourage crossing of legs.</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid elevating the knees on the bed.</span></li>
<li><span>Omit pillows in the popliteal space.</span></li>
<li><span>Begin passive exercises followed by active exercises to promote circulation and prevent venous stasis.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Inadequate renal perfusion can occur as a complication of cardiac surgery. One possible cause is low cardiac output. Trauma to blood cells during CPB can cause hemolysis of red blood cells, which then occlude the renal glomeruli. The use of vasopressor agents to increase blood pressure may constrict the renal arterioles and reduce blood flow to the kidneys.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing management includes accurate measurement of urine output. An output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h may indicate hypovolemia or renal insufficiency. The primary provider may prescribe fluids to increase cardiac output and renal blood flow, or IV diuretics may be given to increase urine output. The nurse should be aware of the patient&#x2019;s blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and serum electrolyte levels. The nurse should report abnormal levels promptly, because it may be necessary to adjust fluids and the dose or type of medication given. If efforts to maintain renal perfusion are ineffective, the patient may require continuous renal replacement therapy or dialysis (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Maintaining Normal Body Temperature</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are usually hypothermic when admitted to the critical care unit following the cardiac surgical procedure. Because induced hypothermia from CPB and anesthesia lower the patient&#x2019;s core temperature, the patient must be gradually warmed to a normal temperature. This is accomplished partially by the patient&#x2019;s own basal metabolic processes and often with the assistance of heated air blanket systems. While the patient is hypothermic, shivering and hypertension are common. Lowering the blood pressure with a vasodilator such as nitroprusside may be necessary. These problems typically resolve as warming occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">After cardiac surgery, the patient is at risk for developing elevated body temperature as a result of tissue inflammation or infection. The inflammatory/immune response to surgery includes the release of cytokines that cause fever (<a href="#bib1787">Norris, 2019</a>). The resultant increase in metabolic rate increases tissue oxygen demands and increases cardiac workload. Antipyretics and other measures are used to lower body temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">Common sites of postoperative infection include the lungs, urinary tract, incisions, and intravascular catheters. Meticulous care is used to prevent contamination at the sites of catheter and tube insertions. Aseptic technique is used when changing dressings and when providing endotracheal tube and catheter care. Clearance of pulmonary secretions is accomplished by frequent repositioning of the patient, suctioning, and chest physical therapy, as well as educating and encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough. All invasive lines and tubes are discontinued as soon as possible after surgery to avoid infection.</p>
<p class="indent">Postpericardiotomy syndrome may occur in patients who undergo cardiac surgery. The syndrome is characterized by fever, pericardial pain, pleural pain, dyspnea, pericardial effusion, pericardial friction rub, and arthralgia. These signs and symptoms may occur days to weeks after surgery, often after the patient has been discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p class="indent">Postpericardiotomy syndrome must be differentiated from other postoperative complications (e.g., infection, incisional pain, MI, pulmonary embolus, bacterial endocarditis, pneumonia, atelectasis). Treatment depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms. Use of colchicine and anti-inflammatory agents may produce an improvement in symptoms (<a href="#bib1767">Lehto, Kiviniemi, Gunn, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="h8"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Depending on the type of surgery and postoperative progress, the patient may be discharged from the hospital 3 to 5 days after surgery. Following recovery from the surgery, patients can expect fewer symptoms from CAD and an improved quality of life. CABG has been shown to increase the lifespan of high-risk patients, including those with left main artery blockages and left ventricular dysfunction with multivessel blockages (<a href="#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the patient may be eager to return home, the patient and family usually are apprehensive about this transition. Family members often express the fear that they are not capable of caring for the patient at home or that they are unprepared to handle complications that may occur.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse helps the patient and family set realistic, achievable goals. An education plan that meets the patient&#x2019;s individual needs is developed with the patient and family. Specific instructions are provided about incision care; signs and symptoms of infection; diet; activity progression and exercise; deep breathing, incentive spirometry, and tobacco use cessation; weight and temperature monitoring; the medication regimen; and follow-up visits with home health nurses, the rehabilitation personnel, the surgeon, and the cardiologist or internist.</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients have difficulty learning and retaining information after cardiac surgery. The patient may experience recent memory loss, short attention span, difficulty with simple math, poor handwriting, and visual disturbances. Patients <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page763" title="763"></span>with these difficulties often become frustrated when they try to resume normal activities. The patient and family are reassured that the difficulty is almost always temporary and will subside, usually in 6 to 8 weeks. In the meantime, instructions are given to the patient at a slower pace than normal, and a family member assumes responsibility for making sure that the prescribed regimen is followed.</p>

</div>
<p class="h8">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Arrangements are made for home, community-based, or transitional care when appropriate. Because the hospital stay is relatively short, it is particularly important for the nurse to assess the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s ability to manage care in the home. The nurse making a home visit continues the education process (see <a href="#ct23-13">Chart 23-13</a>), monitors vital signs and incisions, assesses for signs and symptoms of complications, and provides support for the patient and family. Additional interventions may include dressing changes, diet counseling, and tobacco use cessation strategies. Patients and families need to know that cardiac surgery did not cure the patient&#x2019;s underlying heart disease process. Lifestyle changes for risk factor reduction are essential, and medications taken before surgery to control problems such as blood pressure and hyperlipidemia will still be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse encourages the patient to contact the surgeon, cardiologist, or office nurse with problems or questions. This provides the patient and family with reassurance that professional support is available. The patient is expected to have at least one follow-up visit with the surgeon.</p>
<p class="indent">Education does not end at the time of discharge from the hospital, transitional, or home health care. Many patients and families benefit from supportive programs, including cardiac rehabilitation. These programs provide monitored exercise; instructions about diet and stress reduction; information about resuming work, driving, and sex; assistance with tobacco use cessation; and support groups for patients and families. Hospital or community-based support groups provide information as well as an opportunity for families to share experiences.</p>
