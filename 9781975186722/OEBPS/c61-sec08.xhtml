<p class="nonindent">The cognitive, functional, and behavioral changes that characterize dementia eventually destroy a person&#x2019;s ability to function. The symptoms are usually subtle in onset and often progress slowly until they are obvious and devastating. Dementia in older adults is typically caused by some degree of neurodegeneration (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Gale, Acar, &#x0026; Daffner, 2018</a>). The most common type of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dementia:&lt;/b&gt; broad term for a syndrome characterized by a general decline in higher brain functioning, such as reasoning, with a pattern of eventual decline in the ability to perform even basic activities of daily living, such as toileting and eating">dementia</button></strong> is Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> for discussion of AD). AD alone or in conjunction with other dementing disorders accounts for up to 75% of older adults with dementia (<a href="c61-sec13.xhtml#bib4347">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). Other non-Alzheimer&#x2019;s dementias include degenerative, vascular, neoplastic, demyelinating, infectious, inflammatory, toxic, metabolic, and psychiatric disorders. It is important to identify reversible dementia, which occurs when pathologic conditions masquerade as dementia.</p>
