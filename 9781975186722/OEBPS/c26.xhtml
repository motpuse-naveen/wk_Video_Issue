<h3 class="h3">GLOSSARY</h3>
<p class="gloss">anastomosis: junction of two vessels</p>
<p class="gloss">aneurysm: a localized sac or dilation of an artery formed at a weak point in the vessel wall</p>
<p class="gloss">angioplasty: an invasive procedure that uses a balloon-tipped catheter to dilate a stenotic area of a blood vessel</p>
<p class="gloss">ankle-brachial index (ABI): ratio of the ankle systolic pressure to the brachial systolic pressure; an objective measurement of arterial disease that provides quantification of the degree of stenosis</p>
<p class="gloss">arteriosclerosis: diffuse process whereby the muscle fibers and the endothelial lining of the walls of small arteries and arterioles thicken</p>
<p class="gloss">atherectomy: an invasive procedure that uses a cutting device or laser to remove or reduce plaque in an artery</p>
<p class="gloss">atherosclerosis: inflammatory process involving the accumulation of lipids, calcium, blood components, carbohydrates, and fibrous tissue on the intimal layer of a large- or medium-sized artery</p>
<p class="gloss">bruit: sound produced by turbulent blood flow through an irregular, tortuous, stenotic, or dilated vessel</p>
<p class="gloss">cyanosis: a bluish tint of the skin manifested when the amount of oxygenated hemoglobin contained in the blood is reduced</p>
<p class="gloss">deep vein thrombosis (DVT): a blood clot or thrombus located within a deep vein that causes obstruction or occlusion</p>
<p class="gloss">dissection: separation of the weakened elastic and fibromuscular elements in the medial layer of an artery</p>
<p class="gloss">duplex ultrasonography: combines B-mode grayscale imaging of tissue, organs, and blood vessels with capabilities of estimating velocity changes by the use of a pulsed Doppler</p>
<p class="gloss">embolus: a blood clot, fatty deposit, or air that travels through the blood, lodges in an artery or vein, and blocks flow</p>
<p class="gloss">endovascular: a type of procedure that uses a puncture or small incision to place catheters inside a blood vessel to repair it or insert a device</p>
<p class="gloss">intermittent claudication: a muscular, cramplike pain or fatigue in the extremities consistently reproduced with the same degree of exercise or activity and relieved by rest</p>
<p class="gloss">ischemia: deficient blood supply</p>
<p class="gloss">pulmonary embolism (PE): a blood clot or thrombus within a pulmonary artery that blocks or obstructs blood flow to the lungs</p>
<p class="gloss">rest pain: persistent pain in the foot or digits when the patient is resting, indicating a severe degree of arterial insufficiency</p>
<p class="gloss">rubor: reddish-blue discoloration of the extremities; indicative of severe peripheral arterial damage in vessels that remain dilated and unable to constrict</p>
<p class="gloss">stenosis: narrowing or constriction of a blood vessel</p>
<p class="gloss">thromboembolus: a blood clot that may become dislodged from the vessel where it originally formed</p>
<p class="gloss">thrombus: a blood clot within an artery or a vein</p>
<p class="gloss">venous thromboembolism (VTE): a blood clot that forms in the venous vasculature that may manifest as a DVT or a PE</p>

<p class="nonindent">Conditions of the vascular system include arterial disorders, venous disorders, lymphatic disorders, and cellulitis. These disorders may be seen in patients in both the inpatient and the outpatient setting. Nursing assessment and management depends on an understanding of the vascular system.</p>
