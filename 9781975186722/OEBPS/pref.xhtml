<p class="nonindent">Since 1964, when Lillian Sholtis Brunner and Doris Smith Suddarth introduced the first edition of the <em>Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing</em>, the practice of nursing has flexed, changed, evolved, and advanced to meet changing health needs and expectations for health care. With each subsequent edition of this textbook, Lillian and Doris, and their successors, Suzanne Smeltzer and Brenda Bare (and eventually we, the current authors), admirably updated and revised content to reflect changes and challenges that shaped the practice of nursing, considering complex and interconnected influences and maintaining a focus upon salient social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors. Never have we, nor our distinguished and capable predecessors, had to revise and update seminal medical-surgical nursing concepts, principles, and practices during a global pandemic&#x2014;until now. Most assuredly, this has been a daunting task. Yet, compared to what many of our phenomenally creative, determined, and resilient professional colleagues have had to confront and contend with as a result of this pandemic, our work was much less onerous. We would also like to recognize the long overdue and growing awareness of structural racism within healthcare and the impact of systemic racism on perpetuating stereotypes and health disparities. We encourage nurse educators and students to thoughtfully consider and discuss these issues when exploring epidemiological factors of specific disorders and nursing care throughout the textbook. Now that we have sent this edition to print and have time to reflect upon our work, we find ourselves humbled to call ourselves your peers and so proud of the important and sacred work that you do today and every day. We have decided to break with a long tradition in this textbook that tends to not provide dedications. To YOU our fellow nurses, nursing faculty, and nursing students, we dedicate this book.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3300">Organization</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Brunner &#x0026; Suddarth&#x2019;s Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing,</em> 15th Edition, is organized into 16 units. These units mirror those found in previous editions with the incorporation of some changes. Content was updated throughout all units, with cross-references to specific chapters included as appropriate. Units 1 through 3 cover foundational principles and core concepts related to medical-surgical nursing practice. Units 4 through 15 discuss adult health conditions that are treated medically or surgically. Unit 16 describes community-based challenges that affect medical-surgical nursing practice.</p>
<p class="indent">Units 4 through 15 are structured in the following way to better facilitate comprehension:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The first chapter in the unit covers assessment and includes a review of normal anatomy and physiology of the body system being discussed.</span></li>
<li><span>Subsequent chapters in the unit cover management of specific disorders. Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, assessment and diagnostic findings, medical management, and nursing management are presented. Nursing Process sections, provided for select conditions, clarify and expand on the nurse&#x2019;s role in caring for patients with these conditions.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">There are fewer chapters in this edition than in the past several editions; however, the seminal content within the deleted chapters remains, and is updated and revised. Notably, core content in previous-edition chapters that focused exclusively on <em>therapeutic modalities</em> has now been incorporated into chapters focused on health conditions and disorders, where its application dovetails seamlessly into nursing management and the nursing process. Thus, the application of these modalities to medical-surgical nursing practice is readily apparent.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3301">Special Features</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When caring for patients, nurses assume many different roles, including practitioner, educator, advocate, and researcher. Many of the features in this textbook have been developed to help nurses fulfill these varied responsibilities. Key updates to practice-oriented features in the 15th edition include new unit-opening Case Studies with QSEN Competency Focus&#x2014;a feature that highlights a competency from the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Institute that is applicable to the case study and poses questions for students to consider about relevant knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs). Quality and Safety Nursing Alerts, Genetics in Nursing Practice charts, Ethical Dilemma charts, and Home Care Checklist charts offer updated information.</p>
<p class="indent">Plans of Nursing Care, provided for select disorders, illustrate how the nursing process is applied to meet the patient&#x2019;s health care and nursing needs. New to the 15th edition, nursing diagnoses used in the Plans of Nursing Care and throughout the textbook are those devised and validated by the International Council of Nurses in the <em>International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) Catalogue</em>. (Please note that because of the global foci of these nursing diagnoses, select terms in these diagnoses are spelled in the British manner.)</p>
<p class="indent">A new addition to the textbook this cycle is a chapter focused exclusively on the unique health care needs of persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ). As is the case with other chapters of this textbook, the roles of the professional nurse as a practitioner, educator, advocate, and researcher when providing care for persons who are LGBTQ provide the framework for this new chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, two new features in this edition highlight content related to COVID-19 and care of veterans. <em>COVID-19 Considerations</em> sections identify evidence-based information at the time this material was written related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or the nursing care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <em>Veterans Considerations</em> sections include information applicable to the special care needs of military <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexvi" title="xvi"></span>veterans. Veterans&#x2014;who may include persons from all age groups, genders, races, and socioeconomic strata&#x2014;may have unique health risks based upon dates of service and assignment locale.</p>
<p class="indent">The textbook also provides pedagogical features developed to help readers engage and learn critical content. Concept Mastery Alerts continue to clarify fundamental nursing concepts to improve the reader&#x2019;s understanding of potentially confusing topics, as identified by Misconception Alerts in Lippincott&#x2019;s Adaptive Learning Powered by PrepU. An enhanced suite of online, interactive multimedia resources is also highlighted with icons placed in text near relevant topics. Unfolding Patient Stories (case study vignettes) based on vSim for Nursing patients are part of this suite of resources.</p>
<p class="indent">Read the User&#x2019;s Guide that follows the Preface for a full explanation and visual representation of all special features. See also the &#x201C;Special Charts in This Book&#x201D; and &#x201C;Case Studies in This Book&#x201D; sections of this front matter for the location of these items in the text.</p>
