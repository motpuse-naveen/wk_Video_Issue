<h4 class="h4a" id="s3202">AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Acute upper airway obstruction is a life-threatening medical emergency.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3203">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The airway may be partially or completely occluded. Partial obstruction of the airway can lead to progressive hypoxia, hypercarbia, and respiratory and cardiac arrest. If the airway is completely obstructed, permanent brain injury or death will occur within 3 to 5 minutes secondary to hypoxia. Air movement is absent in the presence of complete airway obstruction. Oxygen saturation of the blood decreases rapidly because obstruction of the airway prevents entry of air into the lungs. Oxygen deficit occurs in the brain, resulting in unconsciousness, with death following rapidly.</p>
<p class="indent">Upper airway obstruction has a number of causes, including aspiration of foreign bodies, anaphylaxis, viral or bacterial infection, trauma, and inhalation or chemical burns. For older adult patients, especially those in extended care facilities, sedative and hypnotic medications, diseases affecting motor coordination (e.g., Parkinson&#x2019;s disease), and mental dysfunction (e.g., dementia, intellectual disability) are risk factors for asphyxiation by food. As patients age, atrophy of the posterior pharynx occurs, resulting in aspiration or difficulty swallowing. In adults, aspiration of a bolus of meat is the most common cause of airway obstruction. Peritonsillar abscesses, epiglottitis, and other acute infectious processes of the posterior pharynx can also result in airway obstruction. The most common causes of airway obstruction are from an allergic reaction (i.e., causing laryngospasm), infection, or angioedema (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3204">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Typically, a person with a foreign-body airway obstruction cannot speak, breathe, or cough. The patient may clutch the neck between the thumb and fingers (i.e., universal distress signal). Other common signs and symptoms include choking, apprehensive appearance, refusing to lie flat, inspiratory and expiratory stridor, labored breathing, the use of accessory muscles (suprasternal and intercostal retraction), flaring nostrils, increasing anxiety, restlessness, and confusion. Cyanosis and loss of consciousness, which develop as hypoxia worsens, are late signs. Action must be taken before these manifestations develop, if possible, or immediately if the patient has already exhibited these signs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3205">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the patient who has a foreign object occluding the airway may involve simply asking the person whether they are choking and require help. If the person is unconscious, inspection of the oropharynx may reveal the offending object. X-rays, laryngoscopy, or bronchoscopy also may be performed. Oxygen supplementation should be considered immediately.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3206">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient can breathe and cough spontaneously, a partial obstruction should be suspected. The patient is encouraged to cough forcefully and to persist with spontaneous coughing and breathing efforts as long as good air exchange exists. There may be some wheezing between coughs. If the patient demonstrates a weak, ineffective cough, high-pitched noise while inhaling, increased respiratory difficulty, or cyanosis, the patient should be managed as if there were complete airway obstruction.</p>
<p class="indent">After the obstruction is removed, rescue breathing is initiated. If the patient has no pulse, cardiac compressions are instituted. These measures provide oxygen to the brain, heart, and other vital organs until definitive medical treatment can restore and support normal heart and ventilatory activity (ENA, 2020a). See <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a> for review of current CPR guidelines.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Establishing an Airway</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Establishing an airway may be as simple as repositioning the patient&#x2019;s head to prevent the tongue from obstructing the pharynx. Alternatively, other maneuvers, such as the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver, the jaw-thrust maneuver, or insertion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2188" title="2188"></span>of specialized equipment, may be needed to open the airway, remove a foreign body, or maintain the airway. In all maneuvers, the cervical spine must be protected from injury. After these maneuvers are performed, the patient is assessed for breathing by watching for chest movement and listening and feeling for air movement. In such a case, nursing diagnoses would include impaired airway clearance associated with obstruction of the airway by the tongue, an object, or fluids (blood, saliva) and impaired breathing associated with airway obstruction or injury.</p>
<p class="indent">An oropharyngeal airway is a semicircular tube or tubelike plastic device that is inserted over the back of the tongue into the lower posterior pharynx in a patient who is breathing spontaneously but who is unconscious. This type of airway prevents the tongue from falling back against the posterior pharynx and obstructing the airway. It also allows health care providers to suction secretions. The nasopharyngeal airway provides the same airway access but is inserted through the nares. With an airway in place the patient may breathe spontaneously. If breathing is ineffective or absent, bag-valve-mask ventilation is necessary (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Atanelov &#x0026; Rebstock, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>In the case of potential facial trauma or basal skull fracture, the nasopharyngeal airway should not be used because it could enter the brain cavity instead of the pharynx.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Endotracheal Intubation</p>
<p class="nonindent">The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to establish and maintain the airway in patients with respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia. Endotracheal intubation is indicated to establish an airway for a patient who cannot be adequately ventilated with an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway, bypass an upper airway obstruction, prevent aspiration, permit connection of the patient to a resuscitation bag or mechanical ventilator, or facilitate the removal of tracheobronchial secretions (see <a href="#ff67-1">Fig. 67-1</a>). Because of the level of skill required, endotracheal intubation is performed only by those who have had extensive training. These may include physicians, nurse anesthetists, respiratory therapists, flight nurses, and nurse practitioners. However, the emergency nurse commonly assists with intubation.</p>
<p class="indent">Rapid sequence intubation may be indicated, which provides management of the patient in a situation similar to that in the operating room. Medications used to facilitate rapid sequence intubation include a sedative, an analgesic, and a neuromuscular blockade agent; these are usually given by the provider performing the intubation.</p>

<p class="h7">Intubation with a King Tube or Laryngeal Mask Airway</p>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient is not hospitalized and cannot be intubated in the field, emergency medical personnel may insert a King Tube, which rapidly provides pharyngeal ventilation. When the tube is inserted into the trachea, it functions like an endotracheal tube (see <a href="#ff67-2">Fig. 67-2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The two balloons that surround the tube are inflated after the tube is inserted. One balloon is large and occludes the oropharynx. This permits ventilation by forcing air through the larynx. The smaller balloon is inflated with air and occludes the esophagus at a site distal to the glottis. Breath sounds are auscultated after balloon inflation to make sure that the oropharyngeal balloon (or cuff) does not obstruct the glottis. One variant type of King Tube is designed so that a gastric tube may also be passed for suction. If it is difficult to establish an airway, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be inserted as an interim airway device. The design of the LMA provides a &#x201C;mask&#x201D; in the subglottic airway with a cuff inflated within the esophagus. It allows easy insertion for rapid airway control until a more definitive airway can be placed. Some LMAs also permit removal of secretions from the esophagus (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Bosson &#x0026; Gordon, 2018</a>) (see <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <a href="c15-sec04.xhtml#ff15-4">Fig. 15-4</a>A).</p>
<p class="h7">Cricothyroidotomy</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cricothyroidotomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical opening of the cricothyroid membrane to obtain an airway that is maintained with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube">Cricothyroidotomy</button></strong> is the opening of the cricothyroid membrane to establish an airway. This procedure is used in emergency situations in which endotracheal intubation is either not possible or contraindicated, as in airway obstruction from extensive maxillofacial trauma, cervical spine injuries, laryngospasm, laryngeal edema (after an allergic reaction or extubation), hemorrhage into neck tissue, or obstruction of the larynx. A cricothyroidotomy is replaced with a formal tracheostomy when the patient is able to tolerate this procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Maintaining Ventilation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the airway is determined to be unobstructed, the nurse must ensure that ventilation is adequate by checking for equal bilateral breath sounds. Satisfactory management of ventilations may prevent hypoxia and hypercapnia. The nurse must quickly assess for absent or diminished breath sounds, open chest wounds, and difficulty delivering artificial breaths for the patient. The nurse should monitor pulse oximetry, capnography, and arterial blood gases if the patient requires airway or ventilatory assistance. A tension pneumothorax can mimic hypovolemia, so ventilatory assessment precedes assessment for hemorrhage. A pneumothorax (both simple and tension) or sucking (open) chest wound is managed with a chest tube and occlusion of the sucking wound; immediate relief of increasing positive intrathoracic pressure and maintenance of adequate ventilation should occur (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
