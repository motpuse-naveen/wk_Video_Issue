<h4 class="h4" id="s1246">Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The NHLs are a heterogeneous group of cancers that originate from the neoplastic growth of lymphoid tissue. Similar to CLL, the neoplastic cells are thought to arise from a single clone of lymphocytes; however, in NHL, the cells may vary morphologically. In contrast to Hodgkin lymphoma, the lymphoid tissues involved are largely infiltrated with malignant cells. The spread of these malignant lymphoid cells occurs unpredictably; true localized disease is uncommon. Lymph nodes from multiple sites may be infiltrated, as may sites outside the lymphoid system (i.e., extranodal tissue; see <a href="#ff30-10">Fig. 30-10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Approximately 85% of NHLs involve malignant B-cell lymphocytes, with the remaining 15% involving T-cell lymphocytes or natural killer cells (NCCN, 2019h). NHL is the seventh most common type of cancer diagnosed in the United States, accounting for about 4% to 5% of all new cancer cases each year. It occurs more commonly in males (NCCN, 2019h). The incidence increases with each decade of life; the median age at diagnosis is 66 years (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018d). The natural course of the disease is variable and dependent upon the type of lymphoma. NHLs can be categorized as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;indolent:&lt;/b&gt; when in reference to a neoplasm refers to a slow-growing cancer that often remains localized or causes few symptoms">indolent</button></strong> (i.e., a slow-growing cancer that often remains localized or causes few symptoms) or aggressive (i.e., a fast-growing cancer that spreads rapidly and causes significant morbidity) (see <a href="#tt30-4">Table 30-4</a>). For example, the 5-year survival rate for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is 72%; for follicular lymphoma it is about 90% (96% localized disease and 85% for distant disease) (ACS, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">Although no common etiologic factor has been identified, the incidence of NHL is increased in patients who have immune deficiencies or autoimmune disorders; had prior treatment for cancer; been an organ transplant recipient; had a history of viral infections (e.g., Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus, HIV, HHV8); and been exposed to herbicides, pesticides, solvents, dyes, and defoliating agents, such as Agent Orange (see Veterans Considerations section in CLL) (ACS, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1247">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of NHL are highly variable, reflecting the diverse nature of the disease. Similar to Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL may start as a painless swelling in one or more lymph nodes in the neck, axillary region, or groin. If the lymphoma is indolent in nature, symptoms may be absent or very minor. Indolent disease accounts for about 40% of all NHL cases (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018d). However, the majority of patients are not diagnosed until the disease has progressed to a later stage, when they have become symptomatic. About one third of patients with NHL have B symptoms (see <strong><a href="c30-sec06.xhtml#ct30-1">Chart 30-1</a></strong>) at the time of diagnosis (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018d).</p>
<p class="indent">Other symptoms depend upon enlarged lymph node site and size, which can compress organs, compromising function. For example, a mass in the mediastinum can cause cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain that may lead to cardiovascular or respiratory distress. An abdominal mass may compromise the bowel or ureters, leading to acute kidney injury or bowel obstruction. Splenomegaly can cause abdominal pain, nausea, early satiety, and weight loss.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1248">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Similar to Hodgkin lymphoma, an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy is required for immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis testing (NCCN, 2019h). The specific histopathologic type of the disease is used to differentiate the subtype of NHL; it also has important prognostic implications and is used to determine appropriate treatment (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018d). Flow cytometry is commonly performed to determine the specific antigen on the malignant cell. Another test that may be performed is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which analyzes the DNA and RNA of the biopsy or blood sample for chromosomal abnormalities.</p>
<p class="indent">Laboratory studies mirror those done for a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma (see that previous discussion). In addition, there may be testing for viruses (e.g., Epstein&#x2013;Barr, HHV8, hepatitis B); polymerase chain reaction (PCR); CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; PET scan; MUGA or ECG (if patient is to receive anthracycline-based regimen); and bone marrow biopsy and aspirate (if marrow involvement is suspected).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the stage of disease is important, often it is not an accurate predictor of prognosis. Two prognostic classification systems are used: the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and, for follicular lymphomas, the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI). Age, performance status, lactate dehydrogenase levels, stage of disease, and extranodal involvement are scored to determine risk of failure or death from disease (ACS, 2020b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1249">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of treatment for NHL is to obtain remission of disease by killing as many of the malignant cells as possible; in contrast, the goal is cure for Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment for NHL is based upon the specific subtype of lymphoma and the stage of disease. Other factors that impact treatment decisions include the patient&#x2019;s age, functional status, laboratory values (especially renal, hepatic, and cardiac), comorbid conditions, and presence of extranodal involvement (i.e., presence of cancer cells outside of the lymph nodes) (<a href="c30-sec15.xhtml#bib2216">Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2016</a>). If the disease is indolent and localized, the treatment of choice may be radiation therapy alone. &#x201C;Watchful waiting&#x201D; may also be a choice for patients with an indolent form of NHL, such as stage I follicular lymphoma, who have no or few symptoms at time of diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">For aggressive subtypes of NHL, combination chemotherapy is typically indicated. One of the most common combinations is CHOP. A MoAb (e.g., rituximab, obinutuzumab) may be given along with the chemotherapy (NCCN, 2019h). Radiation therapy may or may not be added to the treatment <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page974" title="974"></span>regimen. In some cases, a MoAb may be conjugated with a radioactive isotope and used for treatment (e.g., ibritumomab tiuxetan). CNS involvement is common with some aggressive forms of NHL; in this situation, cranial radiation or intrathecal chemotherapy is used in addition to systemic chemotherapy.</p>
<p class="indent">When NHL has relapsed or is refractory to standard treatments, other single agent or combination chemotherapy regimens may be used. For instance, the ICE regimen (i.e., <strong><em>i</em></strong>fosfamide, <strong><em>c</em></strong>arboplatin, and <strong><em>e</em></strong>toposide) may be implemented; or agents such as bendamustine, brentuximab vedotin, romidepsin, or axicabtagene may be tried (NCCN, 2019h). Autologous HSCT (AuHSCT) is another treatment option for relapsed or refractory NHL, particularly in patients younger than 60 years (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion of AuHSCT).</p>
<p class="indent">A rare but potentially life-threatening complication of chemotherapy is tumor lysis syndrome. Tumor lysis syndrome occurs when the intracellular content of the malignant cell breaks down and is released into the peripheral blood and typically occurs 12 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy (NCCN, 2019h). Patients with NHL at highest risk for the development of tumor lysis syndrome are those with large bulky disease and/or deemed to have high-risk or aggressive NHL (e.g., Burkitt&#x2019;s or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]). See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#tt12-13">Table 12-13</a>, for a discussion of manifestations of and treatment for tumor lysis syndrome.</p>
<p class="indent">Reactivation of hepatitis B virus may be seen in patients with NHL who become immunosuppressed following chemotherapy. For example, hepatitis B reactivation can occur in patients treated with rituximab-containing regimens, even if the patient had tested negative for hepatitis B prior to start of treatment (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018d). Preemptive treatment is recommended, including antiviral therapy (i.e., lamivudine or entecavir) and close surveillance in patients at high risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Another rare but potentially life-threatening complication is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which may occur in patients with NHL who are severely immunocompromised and treated with chemotherapeutic agents (Leukemia &#x0026; Lymphoma Society, 2018d; NCCN, 2019h). Symptoms include confusion, motor weakness or poor motor coordination, and visual and possibly speech changes. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this complication. The fatality rate is 90% and tends to occur within 2 months after the diagnosis is confirmed (NCCN, 2019h).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1250">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lymphoma is a highly complex constellation of diseases. When caring for patients with lymphoma, it is extremely important for the nurse to know the specific disease type, stage of disease, treatment history, and current treatment plan. Most of the care for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or NHL takes place in the outpatient setting, unless complications occur (e.g., infection, respiratory compromise due to mediastinal mass). The most commonly used treatment methods are chemotherapy (often combined with a MoAb) and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy causes systemic side effects (e.g., myelosuppression, nausea, hair loss, risk of infection), whereas radiation therapy causes specific side effects that are limited to the area being irradiated. For example, patients receiving abdominal radiation therapy may experience nausea and diarrhea but not hair loss. Regardless of the type of treatment, all patients may experience fatigue (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec07.xhtml#ct12-6">Chart 12-6</a>, Fatigue).</p>
<p class="indent">The risk of infection is significant for these patients, not only from treatment-related myelosuppression but also from the defective immune response that results from the disease itself. Patients need to be educated to minimize the risks of infection, to recognize signs of possible infection, and to contact their primary provider if such signs develop (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec07.xhtml#ct12-6">Chart 12-6</a>, Infection).</p>
<p class="indent">Many lymphomas can be cured with current treatments. However, as survival rates increase, the incidence of second malignancies, particularly AML or MDS, also increases. Therefore, survivors should be screened regularly for the development of second malignancies. Survivors of both Hodgkin lymphoma and NHL may be faced with managing persistent fatigue, depression, anxiety, and cardiac and pulmonary toxicity (ACS, 2019b). Therefore, survivors should be encouraged to have regular follow-up appointments and be screened for the signs and symptoms of possible secondary malignancies. Additionally, patients should be evaluated for cardiovascular and fertility concerns with each patient visit.</p>
<p class="indent">The ACS (2019b) developed health behavior recommendations for cancer survivors, which include avoiding or stopping smoking, maintaining a normal body weight, practicing good nutrition habits (i.e., consuming fruits and vegetables), and engaging in a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise per week. While many survivors do not adhere to these recommendations, those patients who do report higher health-related quality of life (ACS, 2019b).</p>
