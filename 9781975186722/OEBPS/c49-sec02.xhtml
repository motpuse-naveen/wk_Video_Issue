<h4 class="h4" id="s2199">Lower Urinary Tract Infections</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The sterility of the bladder is maintained by several mechanisms, especially important since the urethra is considered a clean, not a sterile space. The physical barrier of the urethra assists in keeping bacteria away from the bladder, while urine flow helps to carry any bacteria away from the bladder. In addition, ureterovesical junction competence, various antibacterial enzymes and antibodies, and antiadherent effects mediated by the mucosal cells of the bladder all play a major part in protecting the sterility of the bladder. Abnormalities or dysfunctions of any of these mechanisms are contributing risk factors for lower UTIs (see <a href="#ct49-1">Chart&#x00A0;49-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Lower UTIs include bacterial <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cystitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the urinary bladder">cystitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the urinary bladder), bacterial <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prostatitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the prostate gland">prostatitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the prostate gland), and bacterial <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urethritis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the urethra">urethritis</button></strong> (inflammation of the urethra).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2200">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For infection to occur, bacteria must gain access to the bladder, attach to and colonize the epithelium of the urinary tract to avoid being washed out with voiding, evade host defense mechanisms, and initiate inflammation. Many UTIs result from fecal organisms ascending from the perineum to the urethra and the bladder and then adhering to the mucosal surfaces.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Bacterial Invasion of the Urinary Tract</h6>
<p class="nonindent">By increasing the normal slow shedding of bladder epithelial cells (resulting in bacteria removal), the bladder can clear large numbers of bacteria. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a hydrophilic protein, normally exerts a nonadherent protective effect against various bacteria. The GAG molecule attracts water molecules, forming a water barrier that serves as a defensive layer between the bladder and the urine. GAG may be impaired by certain agents (cyclamate, saccharin, aspartame, and tryptophan metabolites). The normal bacterial flora of the vagina and urethral area also interfere with adherence of <em>Escherichia coli.</em> Urinary immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the urethra may also provide a barrier to bacteria.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reflux</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An obstruction to free-flowing urine is a condition known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urethrovesical reflux:&lt;/b&gt; an obstruction to free-flowing urine leading to the reflux of urine from the urethra into the bladder">urethrovesical reflux</button></strong>, which is the reflux (backward flow) of urine from the urethra into the bladder (see <a href="#ff49-1">Fig.&#x00A0;49-1</a>). With coughing, sneezing, or straining, the bladder pressure increases, which may force urine from the bladder into the urethra. When the pressure returns to normal, the urine flows back into the bladder, bringing into the bladder bacteria from the anterior portions of the urethra. Urethrovesical reflux is also caused by dysfunction of the bladder neck or urethra. The urethrovesical angle and urethral closure pressure may be altered with menopause, increasing the incidence of infection in postmenopausal women.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ureterovesical or vesicoureteral reflux:&lt;/b&gt; backward flow of urine from the bladder into one or both ureters">Ureterovesical or vesicoureteral reflux</button></strong> refers to the backward flow of urine from the bladder into one or both ureters (see <a href="#ff49-1">Fig.&#x00A0;49-1</a>). Normally, the ureterovesical junction <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1606" title="1606"></span>prevents urine from traveling back into the ureter. The ureters tunnel into the bladder wall so that the bladder musculature compresses a small portion of the ureter during normal voiding. When the ureterovesical valve is impaired by congenital causes or ureteral abnormalities, the bacteria may reach the kidneys and eventually destroy them.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff49-1">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff49-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff49-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;49-1 &#x2022;</span> Mechanisms of urethrovesical and ureterovesical reflux may cause urinary tract infection. <em>Urethrovesical reflux:</em> With coughing and straining, bladder pressure rises, which may force urine from the bladder into the urethra. <strong>A.</strong> When bladder pressure returns to normal, the urine flows back to the bladder (<strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;B cells:&lt;/b&gt; cells that are important for producing a humoral immune response">B</button></strong>), which introduces bacteria from the urethra to the bladder. <em>Ureterovesical reflux:</em> With failure of the ureterovesical valve, urine moves up the ureters during voiding (<strong>C</strong>) and flows into the bladder when voiding stops (<strong>D</strong>). This prevents complete emptying of the bladder. It also leads to urinary stasis and contamination of the ureters with bacteria-laden urine.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Uropathogenic Bacteria</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bacteriuria:&lt;/b&gt; bacteria in the urine">Bacteriuria</button></strong> is the term used to describe the presence of bacteria in the urine. Because urine samples (especially in women) can be easily contaminated by the bacteria normally present in the urethral area, a clean-catch midstream urine specimen is the measure used to establish bacteriuria. In men, contamination of the collected urine sample occurs less frequently.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Routes of Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bacteria enter the urinary tract in three ways: by the transurethral route (ascending infection), through the bloodstream (hematogenous spread), or by means of a fistula from the intestine (direct extension).</p>
<p class="indent">The most common route of infection is transurethral, in which bacteria (often from fecal contamination) colonize the periurethral area and subsequently enter the bladder by means of the urethra (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>). In women, the short urethra offers little resistance to the movement of uropathogenic bacteria. Penile-vaginal intercourse forces the bacteria from the urethra into the bladder. This accounts for the increased incidence of UTIs in women who engage in penile-vaginal intercourse. Bacteria may also enter the urinary tract by means of the blood from a distant site of infection or through direct extension by way of a fistula from the intestinal tract.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2201">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of UTI depend on whether the infection involves the lower (bladder) or upper (kidney) urinary tract and whether the infection is acute or chronic. Signs and symptoms of an uncomplicated lower UTI include burning on urination, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urinary frequency:&lt;/b&gt; voiding more frequently than every 3&#x00A0;hours">urinary frequency</button></strong> (voiding more than every 3 hours), urgency, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;nocturia:&lt;/b&gt; awakening at night to urinate">nocturia</button></strong> (awakening at night to urinate), incontinence, and suprapubic or pelvic pain. Hematuria and back pain may also be present (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Martin, Wingo, &#x0026; Holland, 2019</a>). In older adults, these symptoms are less common (see Gerontologic Considerations section).</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with complicated UTIs, manifestations can range from asymptomatic bacteriuria to gram-negative sepsis with shock. Complicated UTIs often are caused by a broader spectrum of organisms, have a lower response rate to treatment, and tend to recur. Many patients with CAUTIs are asymptomatic; however, any patient with a catheter who suddenly develops signs and symptoms of septic shock should be evaluated for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;urosepsis:&lt;/b&gt; spread of infection from the urinary tract to the bloodstream that results in a systemic infection">urosepsis</button></strong> (the spread of infection from the urinary tract to the bloodstream that results in a systemic infection).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2202"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of bacteriuria in older adults differs from that in younger adults. Bacteriuria increases with age and disability, and women are affected more frequently than men. UTI is the most common infection of older adults and increases in prevalence with age. UTIs occur more frequently in women than in men at younger ages but the gap between the sexes narrows in later life, which is due to reduced penile-vaginal intercourse in women and a higher incidence of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia in men (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In older adults, structural abnormalities secondary to decreased bladder tone, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neurogenic bladder:&lt;/b&gt; bladder dysfunction that results from a disorder or dysfunction of the nervous system and leads to urinary incontinence">neurogenic bladder</button></strong> (dysfunctional bladder) secondary to stroke, or autonomic neuropathy of diabetes may prevent complete emptying of the bladder and increase the risk of UTI (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). When indwelling catheters are used, the risk of CAUTI increases dramatically. Older women often have incomplete emptying of the bladder and urinary stasis. In the absence of estrogen, postmenopausal women are susceptible to colonization and increased adherence of bacteria to the vagina and urethra. Oral or topical estrogen has been used to restore the glycogen content of vaginal epithelial cells and an acidic pH for some postmenopausal women with recurrent cystitis.</p>
<p class="indent">The antibacterial activity of prostatic secretions that protect men from bacterial colonization of the urethra and bladder decreases with aging. The use of catheterization or cystoscopy in evaluation or treatment for prostatic hyperplasia or carcinoma, strictures of the urethra, and neuropathic bladder may contribute to the higher incidence of UTIs in men. The incidence of bacteriuria also increases in men with confusion, dementia, or bowel or bladder incontinence. The most common cause of recurrent UTIs in older males is chronic bacterial prostatitis. Resection of the prostate gland may help reduce its incidence (see <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a href="#ct49-2">Chart&#x00A0;49-2</a> lists other factors that may contribute to UTI in older patients. Diligent hand hygiene, careful perineal care, and frequent toileting may decrease the incidence of UTIs.</p>
<p class="indent">The organisms responsible for UTIs in older adults residing in institutions may differ from those found in patients residing in the community; this is thought to result in part from the frequent use of antibiotic agents by patients in long-term care facilities. <em>Escherichia coli</em> is the most common organism seen in older patients in the community or hospital. However, patients with indwelling catheters are more likely to be infected with organisms such as <em>Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas,</em> or <em>Staphylococcus.</em> Patients who have been previously treated with antibiotics may be infected with <em>Enterococcus</em> species. Frequent reinfections are common in older adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Early symptoms of UTI in postmenopausal women and older adults include malaise, nocturia, urinary incontinence, or a complaint of foul-smelling urine. Additional early symptoms include burning, urgency, and fever (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman et al., 2017</a>). Some patients develop incontinence and delirium with the onset of a UTI.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotics are prescribed when bacteriuria is present (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Treatment regimens are generally the same as those for younger adults, although age-related changes in the intestinal absorption of medications and decreased kidney function and hepatic flow may necessitate alterations in the antimicrobial regimen. Kidney function must be monitored, and medication dosages should be altered accordingly. The nurse carefully monitors fluid intake and output. Increasing fluid intake is advisable, provided that the patient&#x2019;s cardiac status does not contraindicate this action (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2203">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Results of various tests, such as bacterial colony counts, cellular studies, and urine cultures, help confirm the diagnosis of UTI. In an uncomplicated UTI, the strain of bacteria determines the antibiotic of choice (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Urine Cultures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Urine cultures are useful for documenting a UTI and identifying the specific organism present. UTI is diagnosed by bacteria in the urine culture. A colony count greater than 100,000 CFU/mL of urine on a clean-catch midstream or catheterized specimen indicates infection (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). However, symptoms of UTI and subsequent sepsis have occurred with lower bacterial colony counts. The presence of any bacteria in specimens obtained by suprapubic needle aspiration of the urinary bladder, straight catheterization (insertion of a tube into the urinary bladder), or during surgery or cystoscopy is considered clinically significant (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The following groups of patients should have urine cultures obtained when bacteriuria is present (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>All children</span></li>
<li><span>All men (because of the likelihood of structural or functional abnormalities)</span></li>
<li><span>Patients who have been recently hospitalized or who live in long-term care facilities</span></li>

<li><span>Women who have new sexual partners</span></li>
<li><span>Women with a history of compromised immune function or renal problems</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Cellular Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Microscopic hematuria is present in about half of patients with an acute UTI (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pyuria:&lt;/b&gt; white blood cells in the urine">Pyuria</button></strong> (white blood cells [WBCs] in the urine) occurs in all patients with UTI; however, it is not specific for bacterial infection. Pyuria can also be seen with renal calculi, interstitial nephritis, and renal tuberculosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A multiple-test dipstick often includes testing for WBCs, known as the leukocyte esterase test, and nitrite testing (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>). Tests for sexually transmitted infections may be performed because acute urethritis caused by sexually transmitted organisms (i.e., <em>Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,</em> herpes simplex) or acute vaginitis infections (caused by <em>Trichomonas</em> or <em>Candida</em> species) may be responsible for symptoms similar to those of UTIs.</p>
<p class="indent">X-ray images, computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasonography, and kidney scans are useful diagnostic tools. A CT scan may detect pyelonephritis or abscesses. Ultrasonography and kidney scans are extremely sensitive for detecting obstruction, abscesses, tumors, and cysts (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2204">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of UTIs typically involves pharmacologic therapy and patient education. Various prescribed medication regimens are used to treat UTI. The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for treatment of UTIs, particularly for recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in women, guide medical management (AUA, 2019a, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Acute Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ideal medication for treatment of UTI in women is an antibacterial agent that eradicates bacteria from the urinary tract with minimal effects on fecal and vaginal flora, thereby minimizing the incidence of vaginal yeast infections. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1608" title="1608"></span>antibacterial agent should be affordable and should have few adverse effects and low resistance. Because the organism in initial, uncomplicated UTIs in women is most likely <em>E. coli</em> or other fecal flora, the agent should be effective against these organisms. Various treatment regimens have been successful in treating uncomplicated lower UTIs in women: single-dose administration, short-course (3-day) regimens, or 7-day regimens (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman et al., 2017</a>). The trend is toward a shortened course of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated UTIs, because most cases are cured after 3 days of treatment. Medications commonly used to treat UTIs are listed in <a href="#tt49-1">Table&#x00A0;49-1</a>. Regardless of the regimen prescribed, the patient is instructed to take all doses prescribed, even if relief of symptoms occurs promptly. Longer medication courses are indicated for men, pregnant women, and women with pyelonephritis and other types of complicated UTIs. Men with UTIs should be evaluated for possible prostatitis (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Hospitalization and intravenous (IV) antibiotics are occasionally necessary (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Freeman et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Long-Term Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although pharmacologic treatment of UTIs for 3 days is usually adequate in women, infection recurs in about 20% of women treated for uncomplicated UTIs. Infections that recur within 2 weeks of therapy do so because organisms of the original offending strain remain. Relapses suggest that the source of bacteriuria may be the upper urinary tract or that initial treatment was inadequate or given for too short a time. Recurrent infections in men are usually caused by persistence of the same organism; further evaluation and treatment are indicated (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If infection recurs after completing antimicrobial therapy, another short course (3 to 4 days) of full-dose antimicrobial therapy followed by a regular bedtime dose of an antimicrobial agent may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">A meta-analysis of nine studies reported the daily intake of cranberry, especially in the form of capsules, significantly reduced the rate of recurrent UTI compared to placebo with minor adverse effects such as rash and gastrointestinal symptoms (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Tambunan &#x0026; Rahardjo, 2019</a>). The same meta-analysis reported that antibiotics were more effective for the treatment of recurrent UTI compared to cranberry capsules but had more severe adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms and Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Tambunan &#x0026; Rahardjo, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">A history of pertinent signs and symptoms is obtained from the patient with a suspected UTI. The presence of pain, frequency, urgency, hesitancy, and changes in urine are assessed, documented, and reported. The patient&#x2019;s usual pattern of voiding is assessed to detect factors that may predispose them to UTI. Infrequent emptying of the bladder, the association of symptoms of UTI with penile-vaginal intercourse, contraceptive practices, and personal hygiene are assessed. The patient&#x2019;s knowledge about prescribed antimicrobial medications and preventive health care measures is also assessed. In addition, the urine is assessed for volume, color, concentration, cloudiness, and odor&#x2014;all of which are altered by bacteria in the urinary tract. Patients need to be asked specifically about the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Women with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;interstitial cystitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the bladder wall that eventually causes disintegration of the lining and loss of bladder elasticity">interstitial cystitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the bladder wall) use both complementary and conventional therapies. CAM therapies reported include behavioral therapy, physical therapy, stress reduction, and dietary manipulation (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Oh-oka, 2017</a>). Clinical efficacy was reported in a year-long clinical trial of intensive dietary manipulation (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Oh-oka, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The pain associated with a UTI is quickly relieved once effective antimicrobial therapy is initiated. Antispasmodic agents may also be useful in relieving bladder irritability and pain. Analgesic agents and the application of heat to the perineum help relieve pain and spasm. The patient is encouraged to drink liberal amounts of fluids (water and cranberry juice are the best choices) to promote renal blood flow and to flush the bacteria from the urinary tract. Urinary tract irritants (e.g., coffee, tea, citrus, spices, colas, alcohol) should be avoided. Frequent voiding (every 2 to 3 hours) is encouraged to empty the bladder completely, because doing so can lower urine bacterial counts, reduce urinary stasis, and prevent reinfection (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3606">Wu, Grealish, Moyle, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Early recognition of UTI and prompt treatment are essential to prevent recurrent infection and the possibility of complications, such as kidney disease, sepsis (urosepsis), strictures, and obstructions. The goal of treatment is to prevent infection from progressing and causing permanent kidney damage and injury. Thus, the patient must be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms, to test for bacteriuria, and to initiate treatment as prescribed. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy, liberal fluid intake, frequent voiding, and hygienic measures are commonly prescribed for managing UTIs. The patient is instructed to notify the primary provider if fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever, or pruritus occurs. Periodic monitoring of renal function and evaluation for strictures, obstructions, or stones may be indicated for patients with recurrent UTIs.</p>
<div class="box11a"><p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct49-3"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;49-3 <img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Preventing Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient on the following basic information:</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Hygiene</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Shower rather than bathe in the tub because bacteria in the bathwater may enter the urethra.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Clean the perineum and urethral meatus from front to back after each bowel movement. This will help reduce concentrations of pathogens at the urethral opening and, in women, the vaginal opening.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Fluid Intake</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Drink liberal amounts of fluids daily to flush out bacteria. It may be helpful to include at least one glass of cranberry juice per day.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid coffee, tea, colas, alcohol, and other fluids that are urinary tract irritants.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Voiding Habits</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Void every 2 to 3 hours during the day, and completely empty the bladder. This prevents overdistention of the bladder and compromised blood supply to the bladder wall. Both predispose the patient to urinary tract infection. Precautions expressly for women include voiding immediately after penile-vaginal intercourse.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take medication <em>exactly</em> as prescribed. Special timing of administration may be required.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep in mind that if bacteria continue to appear in the urine, long-term antimicrobial therapy may be required to prevent colonization of the periurethral area and recurrence of infection.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>For recurrent infection, consider daily consumption of cranberry juice or capsules.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If prescribed, test urine for presence of bacteria following manufacturer&#x2019;s and health care provider&#x2019;s instructions.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Notify the primary provider if fever occurs or if signs and symptoms persist.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Consult the primary provider regularly for follow-up.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Adapted from Tambunan, M. P., &#x0026; Rahardjo, H. E. (2019). Cranberries for women with recurrent urinary tract infection: A meta-analysis. <em>Medical Journal of Indonesia</em>, <em>28</em>(3), 268&#x2013;275.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Patients with UTIs are at increased risk for gram-negative sepsis. For each day a urinary catheter is in place, the risk of developing CAUTI increases by 3% to 7% per day of catheterization (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3595">Gould, Umscheid, Agarwal, et al., 2019</a>). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has classified a CAUTI as a &#x201C;never event&#x201D; which means no reimbursement to pay for the cost of treatment will be covered by CMS or other insurers if the CAUTI is incurred within an acute care or rehabilitation hospital (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Gould et al., 2019</a>). Urosepsis mortality rates following catheterization are reported to be 25% to 60% (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Newman, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Careful assessment of vital signs and level of consciousness may alert the nurse to kidney involvement or impending sepsis. Positive blood cultures and elevated WBC counts must be reported immediately. At the same time, appropriate antibiotic therapy and increased fluid intake are prescribed (IV antibiotic therapy and fluids may be required). Aggressive early treatment is the key to reducing the mortality rate associated with CAUTI especially in older patients, those with anemia, and those with elevated blood glucose levels (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3597">McCoy, Paredes, Allen, et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3604">Taylor, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="flt_img"><img src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/></span> <span class="spanheadh4">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> In helping patients learn about and prevent or manage a recurrent UTI, the nurse implements education that meets the patient&#x2019;s needs. Health-related behaviors that help prevent recurrent UTIs include practicing careful personal hygiene, increasing fluid intake to promote voiding and dilution of urine, urinating regularly and more frequently, and adhering to the therapeutic regimen (<a href="c49-sec17.xhtml#bib3614">Martin et al., 2019</a>).
