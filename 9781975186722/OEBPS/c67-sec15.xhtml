<h4 class="h4a" id="s3207">HEMORRHAGE</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Stopping bleeding is essential to the care and survival of patients in an emergency or disaster situation. Hemorrhage that results in the reduction of circulating blood volume is a main cause of shock. Minor bleeding, which is usually venous, generally stops spontaneously unless the patient has a bleeding disorder or has been taking anticoagulant agents. Internal hemorrhage can hide in many anatomic spaces and compartments, resulting in shock without external evidence of hemorrhage. The internal spaces and compartments that are capable of housing large amounts of blood include the retroperitoneum, pelvis, chest, and thighs (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of shock: cool, moist skin (resulting from poor peripheral perfusion), decreasing blood pressure, increasing heart rate, delayed capillary refill, and decreasing urine volume (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). The goals of emergency management are to control the bleeding, maintain adequate circulating blood volume for tissue oxygenation, and prevent shock. Patients who hemorrhage are at risk for cardiac arrest caused by hypovolemia with secondary anoxia. Nursing interventions are carried out collaboratively with other members of the emergency health care team (ENA, 2020a).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Fluid Replacement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Whenever a patient is hemorrhaging&#x2014;whether externally or internally&#x2014;a loss of circulating blood results in a fluid volume deficit and decreased cardiac output. Therefore, fluid replacement is imperative to maintain circulation. Typically, two large-gauge IV catheters are inserted, preferably in an uninjured extremity, to provide a means for fluid and blood replacement. Blood samples are obtained for analysis, typing, and cross-matching. Replacement fluids are given as prescribed, depending on clinical estimates of the type and volume of fluid lost. Replacement fluids may include isotonic electrolyte solutions (e.g., lactated Ringer&#x2019;s, normal saline), colloids, and blood component therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Packed red blood cells are infused when there is massive blood loss, which may also necessitate transfusion of other blood components, including platelets and clotting factors (ENA, 2020a). See <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a> for full discussion of blood component therapy indications and treatment.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The infusion rate is determined by the severity of the blood loss and the clinical evidence of hypovolemia. Blood replacement therapy that involves transfusing several units of blood products should be given via warmer when possible, because administration of large amounts of blood that has been refrigerated has a core cooling effect that may lead to cardiac arrest and coagulopathy.</em></p></div>

<h6 class="h6">Control of External Hemorrhage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If a patient is hemorrhaging externally (e.g., from a wound), a rapid physical assessment is performed as the patient&#x2019;s clothing is cut away in an attempt to identify the area of hemorrhage. Direct, firm pressure is applied over the bleeding area or the involved artery at a site that is proximal to the wound (see <a href="#ff67-3">Fig. 67-3</a>). Most bleeding can be stopped or at least controlled by application of direct pressure. Otherwise, unchecked arterial bleeding can result in death. A firm pressure dressing is applied, and the injured part is elevated to stop venous and capillary bleeding, if possible. If the injured area is an extremity, the extremity is immobilized to control blood loss.</p>
<p class="indent">A tourniquet is applied to an extremity when the external hemorrhage cannot be controlled in any other way and until surgery can be performed. The tourniquet is applied just proximal to the wound and tied tightly enough <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2190" title="2190"></span>to control arterial blood flow. The tourniquet is labeled with the date and time it was applied. If the patient has suffered a traumatic amputation with uncontrollable hemorrhage, the tourniquet remains in place until the patient is in the operating room. Time of tourniquet application and removal should be documented. Tourniquet placement among military personnel with battle-associated trauma has demonstrated clear mortality reduction, although it occasionally has led to amputation or fasciotomy (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Cornelius, Campbell, &#x0026; McGauly, 2017</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Control of Internal Hemorrhage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient shows no external signs of bleeding but exhibits tachycardia, falling blood pressure, thirst, apprehension, cool and moist skin, or delayed capillary refill, internal hemorrhage is suspected. Typically, packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets are given at a rapid rate, and the patient is prepared for more definitive treatment (e.g., surgery, pharmacologic therapy). In addition, arterial blood gas specimens are obtained to evaluate pulmonary function and tissue perfusion and to establish baseline hemodynamic parameters, which are then used as an index for determining the amount of fluid replacement the patient can tolerate and the response to therapy. The patient is maintained in the supine position and monitored closely until hemodynamic or circulatory parameters improve, or until they are transported to the operating room or intensive care unit.</p>
