<h4 class="h4a" id="s3183">ISSUES IN EMERGENCY NURSING CARE</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Emergency nursing is demanding because of the diversity of conditions and situations that present unique challenges. These challenges include legal issues, occupational health and safety risks for ED staff, and the challenge of providing holistic care in the context of a fast-paced, technology-driven environment in which serious illness and death are encountered on a daily basis. Another dimension of emergency nursing is providing nursing care in disasters. Disasters result in mass casualty incidents that ensue after natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis); from exposure to pathogens during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics; from human-made unintentional disasters (e.g., bridge collapse, train crash); or from weapons of terror (e.g., blast, biologic, chemical, radiologic terroristic events) (see <a href="c68.xhtml">Chapter 68</a>).</p>
