<h4 class="h4a" id="s1853">HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cirrhosis is a chronic disease characterized by replacement of normal liver tissue with diffuse fibrosis that disrupts the structure and function of the liver. There are three types of cirrhosis or scarring of the liver:</p>
<p class="superMheadpBL1First"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Alcoholic cirrhosis, in which the scar tissue characteristically surrounds the portal areas. This is most frequently caused by chronic alcoholism and is the most common type of cirrhosis.</p>
<p class="superMheadpBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Postnecrotic cirrhosis, in which there are broad bands of scar tissue. This is a late result of a previous bout of acute viral hepatitis.</p>
<p class="superMheadpBL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Biliary cirrhosis, in which scarring occurs in the liver around the bile ducts. This type of cirrhosis usually results from chronic biliary obstruction and cholangitis (bile duct infection); it is much less common.</p>
<p class="indent">The portion of the liver chiefly involved in cirrhosis consists of the portal and the periportal spaces, where the bile canaliculi of each lobule communicate to form the liver bile ducts. These areas become the sites of inflammation, and the bile ducts become occluded with inspissated (thickened) bile and pus. The liver attempts to form new bile channels; hence, there is an overgrowth of tissue made up largely of disconnected, newly formed bile ducts and surrounded by scar tissue.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Several factors have been implicated in the etiology of cirrhosis. Nutritional deficiency with reduced protein intake contributes to liver destruction in cirrhosis, but excessive alcohol intake is the major causative factor in fatty liver and its consequences. However, cirrhosis can occur in people who do not consume alcohol and in those who consume a normal diet and have a high alcohol intake.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people appear to be more susceptible than others to this disease, whether or not they have alcoholism or are malnourished. Other factors may play a role, including exposure to certain chemicals (carbon tetrachloride, chlorinated naphthalene, arsenic, or phosphorus) or infectious schistosomiasis. Twice as many men as women are affected, although, for unknown reasons, women are at greater risk for development of alcohol-induced liver disease. Most patients are between 40 and 60 years of age. Alcohol-associated cirrhosis contributes to up to 50% of the overall cirrhosis burden in the United States and worldwide (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Lucey, 2019</a>). From 1999 to 2016 in the United States, annual deaths from cirrhosis increased by 65% to approximately 35,000 (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Baki, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Tapper, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Alcoholic cirrhosis is characterized by episodes of necrosis involving the liver cells, which sometimes occur repeatedly throughout the course of the disease. The destroyed liver cells are gradually replaced by scar tissue. Eventually, the amount of scar tissue exceeds that of the functioning liver tissue. Islands of residual normal tissue and regenerating liver tissue may project from the constricted areas, giving the cirrhotic liver its characteristic hobnail appearance. The disease usually has an insidious onset and a protracted course, occasionally proceeding over a period of 30 or more years.</p>
<p class="indent">The prognoses for different forms of cirrhosis caused by various liver diseases have been investigated in several studies. Of the many prognostic indicators, the Child&#x2013;Pugh classification seems most useful in predicting the outcome of patients with liver disease (see <a href="#tt43-5">Table 43-5</a>). It is also used in choosing management approaches.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1855">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of cirrhosis increase in severity as the disease progresses, and severity is used to categorize the disorder as compensated or decompensated cirrhosis (see <a href="#ct43-9">Chart 43-9</a>). Compensated cirrhosis, with its less severe, often vague symptoms, may be discovered secondarily at a routine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1394" title="1394"></span>physical examination. The hallmarks of decompensated cirrhosis result from failure of the liver to synthesize proteins, clotting factors, and other substances and manifestations of portal hypertension (see earlier sections of this chapter for clinical manifestations and management of portal hypertension, ascites, varices, and hepatic encephalopathy).</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Liver Enlargement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Early in the course of cirrhosis, the liver tends to be large, and the cells are loaded with fat. The liver is firm and has a sharp edge that is noticeable on palpation. Abdominal pain may be present because of recent, rapid enlargement of the liver, which produces tension on Glisson capsule (the fibrous covering of the liver). Later in the disease, the liver decreases in size as scar tissue contracts the liver tissue. The liver edge, if palpable, is nodular.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Portal Obstruction and Ascites</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Portal obstruction and ascites&#x2014;late manifestations of cirrhosis&#x2014;are caused partly by chronic failure of liver function and partly by obstruction of the portal circulation. Almost all of the blood from the digestive organs is collected in the portal veins and carried to the liver. Because a cirrhotic liver does not allow free blood passage, blood backs up into the spleen and the GI tract, and these organs become the seat of chronic passive congestion&#x2014;that is, they are stagnant with blood and therefore cannot function properly. Indigestion and altered bowel function result. Fluid rich in protein may accumulate in the peritoneal cavity, producing ascites. This can be detected through percussion for shifting dullness or a fluid wave (see <a href="c43-sec07.xhtml#ff43-6">Fig. 43-6</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infection and Peritonitis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bacterial peritonitis may develop in patients with cirrhosis and ascites in the absence of an intra-abdominal source of infection or an abscess. This condition is referred to as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Bacteremia due to translocation of intestinal flora is believed to be the most likely route of infection. Clinical signs may be absent, necessitating paracentesis for diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy is effective in the treatment and prevention of recurrent episodes of SBP. The development of SBP is a precipitating factor to the onset of hepatorenal syndrome, a form of acute kidney injury unresponsive to administration of fluid or diuretic agents (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Adebayo, Neong, &#x0026; Wong, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>). This type of kidney disease is characterized by a lack of pathologic changes in the kidney; there is no evidence of dehydration or obstruction of the urinary tract or any other renal disorder.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal Varices</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The obstruction to blood flow through the liver caused by fibrotic changes also results in the formation of collateral blood vessels in the GI system and shunting of blood from the portal vessels into blood vessels with lower pressures. As a result, the patient with cirrhosis often has prominent, distended abdominal blood vessels, called <em>caput medusae,</em> which are visible on abdominal inspection and distended blood vessels throughout the GI tract. The esophagus, stomach, and lower rectum are common sites of collateral blood vessels. These distended blood vessels form varices or hemorrhoids, depending on their location.</p>
<p class="indent">Because these vessels were not intended to carry the high pressure and volume of blood imposed by cirrhosis, they may rupture and bleed. Therefore, assessment must include observation for occult and frank bleeding from the GI tract.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Edema</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Another late symptom of cirrhosis is edema, which is attributed to chronic liver failure. A reduced plasma albumin <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1395" title="1395"></span>concentration predisposes the patient to the formation of edema. Although edema is generalized, it often affects the lower extremities, the upper extremities, and the presacral area. Facial edema is not typical. Overproduction of aldosterone occurs, causing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vitamin Deficiency and Anemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because of inadequate formation, use, and storage of certain vitamins (notably vitamins A, C, and K), signs of deficiency are common, particularly hemorrhagic phenomena associated with vitamin K deficiency. Chronic gastritis and impaired GI function, together with inadequate dietary intake and impaired liver function, account for the anemia that is often associated with cirrhosis. The patient&#x2019;s anemia, poor nutritional status, and poor state of health result in severe fatigue, which interferes with the ability to carry out routine activities of daily living.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mental Deterioration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Additional clinical manifestations include deterioration of mental and cognitive function with impending hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic coma, as described previously. Serial neurologic assessment is indicated, including assessment of the patient&#x2019;s general behavior, cognitive abilities, orientation to time and place, and speech patterns.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1856">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The extent of liver disease and the type of treatment are determined after review of the laboratory findings. The functions of the liver are complex, and many diagnostic tests provide information about liver function (see <a href="c43-sec03.xhtml#tt43-1">Table 43-1</a>). The patient needs to know why these tests are being performed and how to cooperate.</p>
<p class="indent">In severe parenchymal liver dysfunction, the serum albumin level tends to decrease, and the serum globulin level rises. Enzyme tests indicate liver cell damage: serum alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, and GGT levels increase, and the serum cholinesterase level may decrease. Bilirubin tests are performed to measure bile excretion or retention; increased levels of bilirubin can occur with cirrhosis and other liver disorders. Prothrombin time is prolonged. Normal values for laboratory data are listed in Appendix A on <img class="m" src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/>.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasound scanning is used to measure the difference in density of parenchymal cells and scar tissue. CT, MRI, radioisotope liver scans, and elastography studies give information about liver size, hepatic blood flow and obstruction and the presence of liver fibrosis. Diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy. Arterial blood gas analysis may reveal a ventilation&#x2013;perfusion imbalance and hypoxia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1857">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of the patient with cirrhosis is usually based on the presenting symptoms. For example, antacids or H<sub>2</sub> antagonists are prescribed to decrease gastric distress and minimize the possibility of GI bleeding. Vitamins and nutritional supplements promote healing of damaged liver cells and improve the patient&#x2019;s general nutritional status. Potassium-sparing diuretic agents such as spironolactone or triamterene may be indicated to decrease ascites, if present; these diuretics are preferred because they minimize the fluid and electrolyte changes commonly seen with other agents. An adequate diet and avoidance of alcohol are essential. Although the fibrosis of the cirrhotic liver cannot be reversed, its progression may be halted or slowed by such measures.</p>
<p class="indent">Many medications possess antifibrotic activity for the treatment of cirrhosis. Some of these medications include colchicine, angiotensin system inhibitors, statins, diuretics including spironolactone, immunosuppressants, and glitazones such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone. Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications also have antifibrogenic properties and may also be prescribed (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many advances have been made in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of liver disease and fibrogenesis has led to the recent increase in the number of clinical trials, particularly for patients with NASH. Fibrosis is a key predictor of liver mortality in NASH, and many studies have focused on evaluating the potential of drugs to reduce liver fibrogenesis. Drugs that target different pathways in NASH are, therefore, being evaluated in isolation or as combination therapy. Some of the antifibrotic medications currently under study can reduce injury and inflammation and include vitamin E and chemokine receptor (CCR2/CCR5) inhibitors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists have been shown to cause cell death of hepatic stellate cells that potentiate fibrosis. Farnesoid X receptor agonists, such as obeticholic acid, have been reported to prevent chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3299">Manka Zeller, &#x0026; Syn, 2019</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many patients who have ESLD with cirrhosis use the herb milk thistle (<em>Silybum marianum</em>) to treat jaundice and other symptoms. This herb has been used for centuries because of its healing and regenerative properties for liver disease. Silymarin from milk thistle has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may have beneficial effects, especially in hepatitis, alcohol-induced liver injury and HCC (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Weiskirchen, Weiskirchen, &#x0026; Tacke, 2018</a>). The natural compound SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine) may improve outcomes in liver disease by improving liver function, possibly through enhancing antioxidant function. Primary biliary cirrhosis has been treated with ursodeoxycholic acid to improve liver function.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Rest</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with cirrhosis requires rest and other supportive measures to permit the liver to reestablish its functional ability. If the patient is hospitalized, weight and I&#x0026;O are measured and recorded daily. The nurse adjusts the patient&#x2019;s position in bed for maximal respiratory efficiency, which is especially important if ascites is marked, because it interferes with adequate thoracic excursion. Oxygen therapy may be required in liver failure to oxygenate the damaged cells and prevent further cell destruction.</p>

</table>
<p class="indent1">Rest reduces the demands on the liver and increases the liver&#x2019;s blood supply. Because the patient is susceptible to the hazards of immobility, efforts to prevent respiratory, circulatory, and vascular disturbances are initiated. These measures may help prevent such problems as atelectasis, pneumonia, venous thromboemboli formation, and pressure injuries. After nutritional status improves and strength increases, the nurse encourages the patient to increase activity gradually. Activity and mild exercise, as well as rest, are planned.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Improving Nutritional Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with cirrhosis without ascites, edema, or signs of impending hepatic coma should receive a nutritious, high-protein diet, if tolerated, supplemented by vitamins of the B complex, as well as A, C, and K. The nurse encourages the patient to eat. If ascites is present, small, frequent meals may be better tolerated than three large meals because of the abdominal pressure exerted by ascites.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of probiotics for the management of hepatic encephalopathy is currently the topic of ongoing research. Imbalance of the intestinal flora is not uncommon. Some research suggests that the oral ingestion of 1 cup of probiotic yogurt three times a day reduces intestinal flora imbalance by decreasing <em>Escherichia coli</em> counts and promoting the growth of non&#x2013;urease-producing bacteria. This strategy is thought to then reduce ammonia levels and improve mental status (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Acharya &#x0026; Bajaj, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with steatorrhea (fatty stools) should receive water-soluble forms of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E. Folic acid and iron are prescribed to prevent anemia. Sodium restriction is also indicated to prevent ascites. Patients with prolonged or severe anorexia and those who are vomiting or eating poorly for any reason may receive nutrients by the enteral or parenteral route (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a> for further details on enteral nutrition and <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> for further details on parenteral nutrition).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Skin Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Providing careful skin care is important because of subcutaneous edema, the patient&#x2019;s immobility, jaundice, and increased susceptibility to skin breakdown and infection. Frequent changes in position are necessary to prevent pressure injuries. Irritating soaps and the use of adhesive tape are avoided to prevent trauma to the skin. Lotion may be soothing to irritated skin; the nurse takes measures to minimize scratching by the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Risk of Injury</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse protects the patient with cirrhosis from falls and other injuries. The side rails should be in place and pads used in case the patient becomes agitated or restless. To minimize agitation, the nurse orients the patient to time and place and explains all procedures. The nurse instructs the patient to ask for assistance to get out of bed. The nurse carefully evaluates any injury because of the possibility of internal bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the risk for bleeding from abnormal clotting, the patient should use an electric razor rather than a safety razor. A soft-bristled toothbrush helps minimize bleeding gums, and pressure applied to all venipuncture sites helps minimize bleeding.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A major role of the nurse is monitoring of the patient with cirrhosis for complications.</p>
<p class="h7">Bleeding and Hemorrhage</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is at increased risk for bleeding and hemorrhage because of decreased production of prothrombin and decreased ability of the diseased liver to synthesize the necessary substances for blood coagulation (see the Esophageal Varices section).</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Hepatic Encephalopathy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatic encephalopathy and coma, which are complications of cirrhosis, may manifest as deteriorating mental status (delirium) or as physical signs such as abnormal voluntary and involuntary movements. Hepatic encephalopathy was discussed earlier in the chapter in detail.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1403</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1404" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1404">p. 1404</span></div>
<p class="indent">Monitoring is essential to identify early deterioration in mental status. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s mental status closely and reports changes so that treatment for encephalopathy can be initiated promptly. An extensive baseline and ongoing neurologic evaluation is key to identify progression through the four stages of encephalopathy (see <a href="c43-sec09.xhtml#tt43-3">Table 43-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Each advancing stage demands more intensive nursing interventions aimed at providing for patient safety and prevention and early identification of life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure and cerebral edema, which would necessitate interventions in an ICU. Because electrolyte disturbances can contribute to encephalopathy, serum electrolyte levels are carefully monitored and corrected if abnormal. Oxygen is given if oxygen desaturation occurs. The nurse monitors for fever or abdominal pain, which may signal the onset of bacterial peritonitis or other infection (see earlier discussion of hepatic encephalopathy).</p>
<p class="h7">Fluid Volume Excess</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with advanced chronic liver disease develop cardiovascular abnormalities. These occur due to an increased cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, possibly resulting from the release of vasodilators. A hyperdynamic circulatory state develops in patients with cirrhosis, and plasma volume increases. This increase in circulating plasma volume is probably multifactorial, but some studies have implicated excess production of nitrous oxide, such as that seen in sepsis, as one causative factor (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). The greater the degree of hepatic decompensation, the more severe the hyperdynamic state. Close assessment of cardiovascular and respiratory status is of key importance for the care of patients with this disorder. Pulmonary compromise is always a potential complication of ESLD because of plasma volume excess; consequently, the nurse has an important role in preventing pulmonary complications. Administering diuretic agents, implementing fluid restrictions, and enhancing patient positioning can optimize pulmonary function. Fluid retention may be noted in the development of ascites, lower extremity swelling, and dyspnea. Monitoring of I&#x0026;O, daily weight changes, changes in abdominal girth, and edema formation is part of nursing assessment in the hospital or in the home setting. Patients are also monitored for nocturia and, later, for oliguria, because these states indicate increasing severity of liver dysfunction (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Mansour &#x0026; McPherson, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Schiff et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">During the hospital stay, the nurse and other health care providers prepare the patient with cirrhosis for discharge, focusing on dietary education. Of greatest importance is the exclusion of alcohol from the diet. The patient may benefit from referral to Alcoholics Anonymous, psychiatric care, or counseling or support from a spiritual advisor. The patient should avoid the consumption of raw shellfish.</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium restriction will continue for a considerable time, if not permanently. The patient will require written education, reinforcement, and support from the staff as well as family members.</p>
<p class="indent">Successful treatment depends on convincing the patient of the need to adhere completely to the therapeutic plan. This includes rest, lifestyle changes, adequate dietary intake, and the elimination of alcohol. The nurse also educates the patient and family about symptoms of impending encephalopathy, possible bleeding tendencies, and susceptibility to infection. Nurses should consider implementing the teach-back method when educating patients and families to insure that they are able to describe what they have been taught in their own words or perform a task as instructed (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> for further discussion of the teach-back method).</p>
<p class="indent">Recovery is neither rapid nor easy; there are frequent setbacks and apparent lack of improvement. Many patients find it difficult to refrain from using alcohol for comfort or escape. The nurse has a significant role in offering support and encouragement to the patient and in providing positive feedback when the patient experiences success.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Referral for transitional or home care may assist the patient in dealing with the transition from hospital to home. The use of alcohol may have been an important part of normal home and social life in the past. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s progress at home and the manner in which the patient and family are coping with the elimination of alcohol and the dietary restrictions. The nurse also reinforces previous education and answers questions that may not have occurred to the patient or family until the patient is back home and trying to establish new patterns of eating, drinking, and lifestyle.</p>
