<h4 class="h4" id="s2909">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The nervous system consists of two major parts: the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and autonomic nervous system. The function of the nervous system is to control motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, and behavioral activities. The brain itself contains more than 100 billion cells that link the motor and sensory pathways, monitor the body&#x2019;s processes, respond to the internal and external environment, maintain homeostasis, and direct all psychological, biologic, and physical activity through complex chemical and electrical messages (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Klein &#x0026; Stewart-Amidei, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2910">Cells of the Nervous System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The basic functional unit of the brain is the neuron (see <a href="c60.xhtml#ff60-1">Fig. 60-1</a>). It is composed of dendrites, a cell body, and an axon. The <strong>dendrites</strong> are branch-type structures for receiving electrochemical messages. The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;axon:&lt;/b&gt; portion of the neuron that conducts impulses away from the cell body">axon</button></strong> is a long projection that carries electrical impulses away from the cell body. Some axons have a myelinated sheath that increases speed of conduction. Nerve cell bodies occurring in clusters are called <em>ganglia</em> or <em>nuclei.</em> A cluster of cell bodies with the same function is called a <em>center</em> (e.g., the respiratory center). Neurons are supported, protected, and nourished by glial cells, which are 50 times greater in number than neurons (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2911">Neurotransmitters</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neurotransmitters communicate messages from one neuron to another or from a neuron to a target cell, such as muscle or endocrine cells. Neurotransmitters are manufactured and stored in synaptic vesicles. As an electrical action potential moves along the axon and reaches the nerve terminal, neurotransmitters are released into the synapse. The neurotransmitter is transported across the synapse, binding to receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. A neurotransmitter can either excite or inhibit activity of the target cell. Usually, multiple neurotransmitters are at work in the neural synapse. The source and action of major neurotransmitters are described in <a href="#tt60-1">Table 60-1</a>. Once released, enzymes either destroy the neurotransmitter or reabsorb it into the neuron for future use.</p>
<p class="indent">Many neurologic disorders are due, at least in part, to an imbalance in neurotransmitters. For example, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1968" title="1968"></span>Parkinson&#x2019;s disease develops from decreased availability of dopamine, whereas acetylcholine binding to muscle cells is impaired in myasthenia gravis (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Norris, 2019</a>). All brain functions are modulated through neurotransmitter receptor site activity, including memory and other cognitive processes (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Ongoing research is evaluating diagnostic tests that can detect abnormal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. Positron emission tomography (PET), for example, can detect dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), similar to PET, can detect changes in some neurotransmitters, such as dopamine in Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Both PET and SPECT are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2912">The Central Nervous System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.</p>
<h6 class="h6">The Brain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The brain accounts for approximately 2% of the total-body weight; in an average young adult, the brain weighs approximately 1400 g, whereas in an average older adult, the brain weighs approximately 1200 g (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The brain is divided into three major areas: the cerebrum, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. The cerebrum is composed of two hemispheres, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the basal ganglia. The brain stem includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla. The cerebellum is located under the cerebrum and behind the brain stem (see <a href="#ff60-2">Fig. 60-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Cerebrum</p>
<p class="nonindent">The outside surface of the hemispheres has a wrinkled appearance that is the result of many folded layers or convolutions called <em>gyri,</em> which increase the surface area of the brain, accounting for the high level of activity carried out by such a small-appearing organ. Between each gyrus is a sulcus or fissure that serves as an anatomic division. In between the cerebral hemispheres is the great longitudinal fissure that separates the cerebrum into the right and left hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined at the lower portion of the fissure by the corpus callosum. The external or outer portion of the hemispheres (the cerebral cortex) is made up of gray matter approximately 2 to 5 mm in depth; it contains billions of neuron cell bodies, giving it a gray appearance. White matter makes up the innermost layer and is composed of myelinated nerve fibers and neuroglia cells that form tracts or pathways connecting various parts of the brain with one another. These pathways also connect the cortex with lower portions of the brain and spinal cord. The cerebral hemispheres are divided into pairs of lobes as follows (see <a href="#ff60-2">Fig. 60-2</a>):</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff60-2">

<img src="images/ff60-2.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff60-2.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;60-2 &#x2022;</span> View of the external surface of the brain showing lobes, cerebellum, and brain stem.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="bull56"><li><em>Frontal</em>&#x2014;the largest lobe, located in the front of the brain. The major functions of this lobe are concentration, abstract thought, information storage or memory, and motor function. It contains Broca area, which is in the left hemisphere and is critical for motor control of speech. The frontal lobe is also responsible in large part for a person&#x2019;s affect, judgment, personality, and inhibitions (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</li>
<li><em>Parietal</em>&#x2014;a predominantly sensory lobe posterior to the frontal lobe. This lobe analyzes sensory information and relays the interpretation of this information to other cortical areas and is essential to a person&#x2019;s awareness of body position in space, size and shape discrimination, and right&#x2013;left orientation (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</li>
<li><em>Temporal</em>&#x2014;located inferior to the frontal and parietal lobes, this lobe contains the auditory receptive areas and plays a role in memory of sound and understanding of language and music.</li>
<li><em>Occipital</em>&#x2014;located posterior to the parietal lobe, this lobe is responsible for visual interpretation and memory.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The corpus callosum (see <a href="#ff60-3">Fig. 60-3</a>), a thick collection of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, is responsible for the transmission of information from one side of the brain to the other. Information transferred includes sensation, memory, and learned discrimination. Right-handed people and some left-handed people have cerebral <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1969" title="1969"></span>dominance on the left side of the brain for verbal, linguistic, arithmetic, calculation, and analytic functions. The nondominant hemisphere is responsible for geometric, spatial, visual, pattern, and musical functions. Nuclei for cranial nerves I and II are also located in the cerebrum.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff60-3">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff60-3.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff60-3.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;60-3 &#x2022;</span> Medial view of the brain.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The thalami lie on either side of the third ventricle and act primarily as a relay station for all sensation except smell. All memory, sensation, and pain impulses pass through this section of the brain. The hypothalamus (see <a href="#ff60-3">Fig. 60-3</a>) is located anterior and inferior to the thalamus, and beneath and lateral to the third ventricle. The infundibulum of the hypothalamus connects it to the posterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus plays an important role in the endocrine system because it regulates the pituitary secretion of hormones that influence metabolism, reproduction, stress response, and urine production. It works with the pituitary to maintain fluid balance through hormonal release and maintains temperature regulation by promoting vasoconstriction or vasodilatation. In addition, the hypothalamus is the site of the hunger center and is involved in appetite control. It contains centers that regulate the sleep&#x2013;wake cycle, blood pressure, aggressive and sexual behavior, and emotional responses (e.g., blushing, rage, depression, panic, fear). The hypothalamus also controls and regulates the autonomic nervous system. The optic chiasm (the point at which the two optic tracts cross) and the mammillary bodies (involved in olfactory reflexes and emotional response to odors) are also found in this area.</p>
<p class="indent">The basal ganglia are masses of nuclei located deep in the cerebral hemispheres that are responsible for control of fine motor movements, including those of the hands and lower extremities.</p>
<p class="h7">Brain Stem</p>
<p class="nonindent">The brain stem consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata (see <a href="#ff60-2">Fig. 60-2</a>). The midbrain connects the pons and the cerebellum with the cerebral hemispheres; it contains sensory and motor pathways and serves as the center for auditory and visual reflexes. Cranial nerves III and IV originate in the midbrain. The pons is situated in front of the cerebellum between the midbrain and the medulla and is a bridge between the two halves of the cerebellum, and between the medulla and the midbrain. Cranial nerves V through VIII originate in the pons. The pons also contains motor and sensory pathways. Portions of the pons help regulate respiration.</p>
<p class="indent">Motor fibers from the brain to the spinal cord and sensory fibers from the spinal cord to the brain are in the medulla. Most of these fibers cross, or decussate, at this level. Cranial nerves IX through XII originate in the medulla. Reflex centers for respiration, blood pressure, heart rate, coughing, vomiting, swallowing, and sneezing are also located in the medulla. The reticular formation, responsible for arousal and the sleep&#x2013;wake cycle, begins in the medulla and connects with numerous higher structures.</p>
<p class="h7">Cerebellum</p>
<p class="nonindent">The cerebellum is posterior to the midbrain and pons, and below the occipital lobe (see <a href="#ff60-2">Fig. 60-2</a>). The cerebellum integrates sensory information to provide smooth coordinated movement. It controls fine movement, balance, and <strong>position (postural) sense</strong> or proprioception (awareness of position of extremities without looking at them).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Structures Protecting the Brain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The brain is contained in the rigid skull, which protects it from injury. The major bones of the skull are the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and sphenoid bones. These bones join at the suture lines (see <a href="#ff60-4">Fig. 60-4</a>) and form the base of the skull. Indentations in the skull base are known as fossae. The anterior fossa contains the frontal lobe, the middle fossa contains the temporal lobe, and the posterior fossa contains the cerebellum and brain stem.</p>
<p class="indent">The meninges (fibrous connective tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord) provide protection, support, and nourishment. The layers of the meninges are the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater (see <a href="#ff60-5">Fig. 60-5</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li><em>Dura mater</em>&#x2014;the outermost layer; covers the brain and the spinal cord. It is tough, thick, inelastic, fibrous, and gray. There are three major extensions of the dura: the falx cerebri, which folds between the two hemispheres; the tentorium, which folds between the occipital lobe and cerebellum to form a tough, membranous shelf; and the falx cerebelli, which is located between the right and left side of the cerebellum. When excess pressure occurs in the cranial cavity, brain tissue may be compressed against these dural folds or displaced around them, a process called <em>herniation.</em> A potential space exists between the dura and the skull, and between the periosteum and the dura in the vertebral column, known as the epidural space. Another potential space, the subdural space, also exists below the dura. Blood or an abscess can accumulate in these potential spaces.
<div class="figure" id="ff60-5">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff60-5.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff60-5.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;60-5 &#x2022;</span> Meninges and related structures.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
</li>
<li><em>Arachnoid</em>&#x2014;the middle membrane; an extremely thin, delicate membrane that closely resembles a spider web (hence the name <em>arachnoid</em>). The arachnoid membrane has cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the space below it, known as the subarachnoid space. This membrane has arachnoid villi, which are unique finger-like projections that absorb CSF into the venous system. When blood or bacteria enter the subarachnoid space, the villi become obstructed and <em>communicating</em> hydrocephalus (increased size of ventricles) may result.</li>
<li><em>Pia mater</em>&#x2014;the innermost, thin, transparent layer that hugs the brain closely and extends into every fold of the brain&#x2019;s surface.</li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Cerebrospinal Fluid</h6>
<p class="nonindent">CSF is a clear and colorless fluid that is produced in the choroid plexus of the ventricles and circulates around the surface of the brain and the spinal cord. There are four ventricles: the right and left lateral and the third and fourth ventricles. The two lateral ventricles open into the third ventricle at the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro). The third and fourth ventricles connect via the aqueduct of Sylvius. The fourth ventricle drains CSF into the subarachnoid space on the surface of the brain and spinal cord, where it is absorbed by the arachnoid villi. Blockage of the flow of CSF anywhere in the ventricular system produces <em>obstructive</em> hydrocephalus.</p>
<p class="indent">CSF is important in immune and metabolic functions in the brain. It is produced at a rate of about 500 mL/day; the ventricles and subarachnoid space contain approximately 125 to 150 mL of fluid (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>). The composition of CSF is similar to other extracellular fluids (such as blood plasma), but the concentrations of the various constituents differ. A laboratory analysis of CSF indicates color (clear), specific gravity (normal 1.007), protein count, cell count, glucose, and other electrolyte levels (see Table A-5 in Appendix A on <img class="m" src="images/thepoint.jpg" alt=""/>). Normal CSF contains a minimal number of white blood cells and no red blood cells. The CSF may also be tested for immunoglobulins or the presence of bacteria. A CSF sample may be obtained through a lumbar puncture or intraventricular catheter (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cerebral Circulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The brain does not store nutrients and requires a constant supply of oxygen. These needs are met through cerebral circulation; the brain receives approximately 15% of the cardiac output, or 750 mL per minute of blood flow. Brain circulation is unique in several aspects. First, arterial and venous vessels are not parallel as in other organs in the body; this is due in part to the role the venous system plays in CSF absorption. Second, the brain has collateral circulation through the circle of Willis (see later discussion), allowing blood flow to be redirected on demand. Third, blood vessels in the brain have two rather than three layers, which may make them more prone to rupture when weakened or under pressure.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff60-6">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff60-6.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff60-6.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;60-6 &#x2022;</span> Arterial blood supply of the brain, including the circle of Willis, as viewed from the ventral surface.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Arteries</p>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial blood supply to the anterior brain originates from the common carotid artery, which is the first bifurcation of the aorta. The internal carotid arteries arise at the bifurcation of the common carotid. Branches of the internal carotid arteries (the anterior and middle cerebral arteries) and their connections (the anterior and posterior communicating arteries) form the circle of Willis (see <a href="#ff60-6">Fig. 60-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The vertebral arteries branch from the subclavian arteries to supply most of the posterior circulation of the brain. At the level of the brain stem, the vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery. The basilar artery divides to form the two branches of the posterior cerebral arteries. Functionally, the posterior and anterior portions of the circulation usually remain separate. However, the circle of Willis can provide collateral circulation through communicating arteries if one of the vessels supplying it becomes occluded or is ligated.</p>
<p class="indent">The bifurcations along the circle of Willis are frequent sites of aneurysm formation. Aneurysms are outpouchings of the blood vessel due to vessel wall weakness. Aneurysms can rupture and cause a hemorrhagic stroke. See <a href="c62.xhtml">Chapter 62</a> for a more detailed discussion of aneurysms.</p>
<p class="h7">Veins</p>
<p class="nonindent">Venous drainage for the brain does not follow the arterial circulation as in other body structures. The veins reach the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1971" title="1971"></span>brain&#x2019;s surface, join larger veins, and then cross the subarachnoid space and empty into the dural sinuses, which are the vascular channels embedded in the dura (see <a href="#ff60-5">Fig. 60-5</a>). The network of the sinuses carries venous outflow from the brain and empties into the internal jugular veins, returning the blood to the heart. Cerebral veins are unique, because unlike other veins in the body, they do not have valves to prevent blood from flowing backward and depend on both gravity and blood pressure for flow.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Blood&#x2013;Brain Barrier</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The CNS is inaccessible to many substances that circulate in the blood plasma (e.g., dyes, medications, antibiotic agents) because of the blood&#x2013;brain barrier. This barrier is formed by the endothelial cells of the brain&#x2019;s capillaries, which form continuous tight junctions, creating a barrier to macromolecules and many compounds. All substances entering the CSF must filter through the capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes. The blood&#x2013;brain barrier has a protective function but can be altered by trauma, cerebral edema, and cerebral hypoxemia; this has implications for treatment and selection of medications for CNS disorders (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Hickey &#x0026; Strayer, 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">The Spinal Cord</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The spinal cord is continuous with the medulla, extending from the cerebral hemispheres and serving as the connection between the brain and the periphery. Approximately 45 cm (18 inches) long and about the thickness of a finger, it extends from the foramen magnum at the base of the skull to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra, where it tapers to a fibrous band called the <em>conus medullaris.</em> Continuing below the second lumbar space are the nerve roots that extend beyond the conus, which are called the <em>cauda equina</em> because they resemble a horse&#x2019;s tail. Meninges surround the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="indent">In a cross-sectional view, the spinal cord has an H-shaped central core of nerve cell bodies (gray matter) surrounded by ascending and descending tracts (white matter) (see <a href="#ff60-7">Fig. 60-7</a>). The lower portion of the H is broader than the upper portion and corresponds to the anterior horns. The anterior horns contain cells with fibers that form the anterior (motor) root and are essential for the voluntary and reflex activity of the muscles they innervate. The thinner posterior (upper horns) portion contains cells with fibers that enter over the posterior (sensory) root and thus serve as a relay station in the sensory/reflex pathway.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff60-7">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff60-7.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff60-7.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;60-7 &#x2022;</span> Cross-sectional diagram of the spinal cord showing major spinal tracts.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The thoracic region of the spinal cord has a projection from each side at the crossbar of the H-shaped structure of gray matter called the <em>lateral horn.</em> It contains the cells that give rise to the autonomic fibers of the sympathetic division. The fibers leave the spinal cord through the anterior roots in the thoracic and upper lumbar segments.</p>
<p class="h7">The Spinal Tracts</p>
<p class="nonindent">The white matter of the spinal cord is composed of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. The fast-conducting myelinated fibers form bundles; fiber bundles with a common function are called <em>tracts.</em></p>
<p class="indent">There are six ascending tracts (see <a href="#ff60-7">Fig. 60-7</a>). Two tracts, known as the fasciculus cuneatus and gracilis or the posterior columns, conduct sensations of deep touch, pressure, vibration, position, and passive motion from the same side of the body. Before reaching the cerebral cortex, these fibers cross to the opposite side in the medulla. The anterior and posterior spinocerebellar tracts conduct sensory impulses from muscle spindles, providing necessary input for coordinated muscle contraction. They ascend uncrossed and terminate in the cerebellum. The anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts are responsible for conduction of pain, temperature, proprioception, fine touch, and vibratory sense from the upper body to the brain. They cross to the opposite side of the cord and then ascend to the brain, terminating in the thalamus (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Klein &#x0026; Stewart-Amidei, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There are eight descending tracts (see <a href="#ff60-7">Fig. 60-7</a>). The anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts conduct motor impulses to the anterior horn cells from the opposite side of the brain, cross in the medulla, and control voluntary muscle activity. The three vestibulospinal tracts descend uncrossed and are involved in some autonomic functions (sweating, pupil dilation, and circulation) and involuntary muscle control. The corticobulbar tract conducts impulses responsible for voluntary head and facial muscle movement and crosses at the level of the brain stem. The rubrospinal and reticulospinal tracts conduct impulses involved with involuntary muscle movement.</p>
<p class="h7">Vertebral Column</p>
<p class="nonindent">The bones of the vertebral column surround and protect the spinal cord and normally consist of 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar vertebrae, as well as the sacrum (a fused mass of 5 vertebrae) and terminate in the coccyx. Nerve roots exit from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramina (openings). The vertebrae are separated by discs, except for the first and second cervical, the sacral, and the coccygeal vertebrae. Each vertebra has a ventral solid body and a dorsal segment or arch, which is posterior to the body. The arch is composed of two pedicles and two laminae supporting seven processes. The vertebral body, arch, pedicles, and laminae all encase and protect the spinal cord.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2913">The Peripheral Nervous System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The peripheral nervous system includes the cranial nerves, the spinal nerves, and the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1971</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1972" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1972">p. 1972</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Cranial Nerves</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Twelve pairs of cranial nerves emerge from the lower surface of the brain and pass through openings in the base of the skull. Three cranial nerves are entirely sensory (I, II, VIII), five are motor (III, IV, VI, XI, and XII), and four are mixed sensory and motor (V, VII, IX, and X). The cranial nerves are numbered in the order in which they arise from the brain (see <a href="#ff60-8">Fig. 60-8</a>). The cranial nerves innervate the head, neck, and special sense structures. <a href="#tt60-2">Table 60-2</a> provides a summary of the cranial nerves.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Spinal Nerves</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The spinal cord is composed of 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. Each spinal nerve has a ventral root and a dorsal root. The dorsal roots are sensory and transmit sensory impulses from specific areas of the body known as dermatomes (see <a href="#ff60-9">Fig. 60-9</a>) to the dorsal horn ganglia. The sensory fiber may be somatic, carrying information about pain, temperature, touch, and position sense (proprioception) from the tendons, joints, and body surfaces; or visceral, carrying information from the internal organs.</p>

<p class="indent">The ventral roots are motor and transmit impulses from the spinal cord to the body; these fibers are also either somatic or visceral. The visceral fibers include autonomic fibers that control the cardiac muscles and glandular secretions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Autonomic Nervous System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;autonomic nervous system:&lt;/b&gt; division of the nervous system that regulates the involuntary body functions">autonomic nervous system</button></strong> regulates the activities of internal organs such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, digestive organs, and glands (see <a href="#ff60-10">Fig. 60-10</a>). Maintenance and restoration of internal homeostasis is largely the responsibility of the autonomic nervous system. There are two major divisions: the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;sympathetic nervous system:&lt;/b&gt; division of the autonomic nervous system with predominantly excitatory responses (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: the &#x201C;fight-or-flight&#x201D; system)">sympathetic nervous system</button></strong>, with predominantly excitatory responses (i.e., the &#x201C;fight-or-flight&#x201D; response), and the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls mostly visceral functions.</p>
<p class="indent">The autonomic nervous system innervates most body organs. Although usually considered part of the peripheral nervous system, this system is regulated by centers in the spinal cord, brain stem, and hypothalamus.</p>
<p class="indent">The hypothalamus is the major subcortical center for the regulation of autonomic activities, serving an inhibitory&#x2013;excitatory role. The hypothalamus has connections that link the autonomic system with the thalamus, the cortex, the olfactory apparatus, and the pituitary gland. Located here are the mechanisms for the control of visceral and somatic reactions that were originally important for defense or attack and are associated with emotional states (e.g., fear, anger, anxiety); for the control of metabolic processes, including fat, carbohydrate, and water metabolism; for the regulation of body temperature, arterial pressure, and all muscular and glandular activities of the gastrointestinal tract; for control of genital functions; and for the sleep cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">The autonomic nervous system is separated into the anatomically and functionally distinct sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Most of the tissues and the organs under autonomic control are innervated by both systems. For example, the parasympathetic division causes contraction (stimulation) of the urinary bladder muscles and a decrease (inhibition) in heart rate, whereas the sympathetic division produces relaxation (inhibition) of the urinary bladder and an increase (stimulation) in the rate and force of the heartbeat. <a href="#tt60-3">Table 60-3</a> compares the sympathetic and the parasympathetic effects on the different systems of the body.</p>
<p class="h7">Sympathetic Nervous System</p>
<p class="nonindent">The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is best known for its role in the body&#x2019;s fight-or-flight response. Under stress from either physical or emotional causes, sympathetic impulses increase greatly. As a result, the bronchioles dilate for easier gas exchange; the heart&#x2019;s contractions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1974" title="1974"></span>are stronger and faster; the arteries to the heart and voluntary muscles dilate, carrying more blood to these organs; peripheral blood vessels constrict, making the skin feel cool but shunting blood to essential organs; the pupils dilate; the liver releases glucose for quick energy; peristalsis slows; hair stands on end; and perspiration increases. The main sympathetic neurotransmitter is norepinephrine (noradrenaline). A sympathetic discharge releases epinephrine (adrenalin)&#x2014;hence, the term <em>adrenergic</em> is often used to refer to this division.</p>

<p class="indent">Sympathetic neurons are located primarily in the thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord, and their axons, or the preganglionic fibers, emerge by way of anterior nerve roots from the eighth cervical or first thoracic segment to the second or third lumbar segment. A short distance from the cord, these fibers diverge to join a chain, composed of 22 linked ganglia, that extends the entire length of the spinal column, adjacent to the vertebral bodies on both sides. Some form multiple synapses with nerve cells within the chain. Others traverse the chain without making connections or losing continuity to join large &#x201C;prevertebral&#x201D; ganglia in the thorax, the abdomen, or the pelvis or one of the &#x201C;terminal&#x201D; ganglia in the vicinity of an organ, such as the bladder or the rectum at the end of the colon (see <a href="#ff60-10">Fig. 60-10</a>). Postganglionic nerve fibers originating in the sympathetic chain rejoin the spinal nerves that supply the extremities and are distributed to blood vessels, sweat glands, and smooth muscle tissue in the skin. Postganglionic fibers from the prevertebral plexuses (e.g., the cardiac, pulmonary, splanchnic, pelvic plexuses) supply structures in the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, respectively, having been joined in these plexuses by fibers from the parasympathetic division.</p>

<p class="indent">The adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, spleen, stomach, and duodenum are under the control of the giant celiac plexus, commonly known as the solar plexus. This receives its sympathetic nerve components by way of the three splanchnic nerves, composed of preganglionic fibers from nine segments of the spinal cord (T4 to L1), and is joined by the vagus nerve, representing the parasympathetic division. From the celiac plexus, fibers of both divisions travel along the course of blood vessels to their target organs.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain syndromes are distinctive to the sympathetic nervous system. For example, sympathetic storm is a syndrome associated with changes in level of consciousness, altered vital signs, diaphoresis, and agitation that may result from hypothalamic stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system following traumatic brain injury (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Parasympathetic Nervous System</p>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;parasympathetic nervous system:&lt;/b&gt; division of the autonomic nervous system active primarily during nonstressful conditions, controlling mostly visceral functions">parasympathetic nervous system</button></strong> functions as the dominant controller for most visceral functions; the primary neurotransmitter is acetylcholine. During quiet, nonstressful conditions, impulses from parasympathetic fibers (cholinergic) predominate. The fibers of the parasympathetic system are located in two sections: one in the brain stem and the other from spinal segments below L2. Because of the location of these fibers, the parasympathetic system is referred to as the craniosacral division, as distinct from the thoracolumbar (sympathetic) division of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p class="indent">The parasympathetic nerves arise from the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. Fibers from cells in the midbrain travel with the third oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglia, where postganglionic fibers of this division are joined by those of the sympathetic system, creating controlled opposition, with a delicate balance always maintained between the two systems.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Motor pathways within the CNS are responsible for voluntary, involuntary, and coordination of movement. Sensory pathways receive, integrate, and transmit a wide variety of sensations within the CNS.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Motor Pathways</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The corticospinal tract begins in the motor cortex, a vertical band within each frontal lobe, and controls voluntary movements of the body. The exact locations within the brain at which the voluntary movements of the muscles of the face, thumb, hand, arm, trunk, and leg originate are known (see <a href="#ff60-11">Fig. 60-11</a>). To initiate movement, these particular cells must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1976" title="1976"></span>send the stimulus along their fibers. Stimulation of these cells with an electric current also results in muscle contraction. En route to the pons, the motor fibers converge into a tight bundle known as the internal capsule. A comparatively small injury to the internal capsule results in a more severe paralysis than does a larger injury to the cortex itself.</p>

<p class="indent">At the medulla, the corticospinal tracts cross to the opposite side, continuing to the anterior horn of the spinal cord, in proximity to a motor nerve cell. Until this point, neurons are known as upper motor neurons. As they connect to motor fibers of the spinal nerves, they become lower motor neurons. The lower motor neurons receive the impulse in the posterior part of the cord and run to the myoneural junction located in the peripheral muscle.</p>
<p class="indent">Involuntary motor activity is also possible and is mediated through reflex arcs. Synaptic connections between anterior horn cells and sensory fibers that have entered adjacent or neighboring segments of the spinal cord serve as protective mechanisms. These connections are seen during deep tendon reflex testing.</p>
<p class="h7">Upper and Lower Motor Neurons</p>
<p class="nonindent">The voluntary motor system consists of two groups of neurons: upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. Their fibers make up the descending motor pathways, are located entirely within the CNS, and modulate the activity of the lower motor neurons. Lower motor neurons are located either in the anterior horn of the spinal cord gray matter or within cranial nerve nuclei in the brain stem. Axons of lower motor neurons in both sites extend through peripheral nerves and terminate in skeletal muscle. Lower motor neurons are located in both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p class="indent">The motor pathways from the brain to the spinal cord, as well as from the cerebrum to the brain stem, are formed by upper motor neurons. They begin in the cortex of one side of the brain, descend through the internal capsule, cross to the opposite side in the brain stem, descend through the corticospinal tract, and synapse with the lower motor neurons in the cord. The lower motor neurons receive the impulse in the posterior part of the cord and run to the myoneural junction located in the peripheral muscle. The clinical features of lesions of upper and lower motor neurons are discussed in the following sections and in <a href="#tt60-4">Table 60-4</a>.</p>

<p class="h8">Upper Motor Neuron Lesions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Upper motor neuron lesions can involve the motor cortex, the internal capsule, the spinal cord gray matter, and other structures of the brain through which the corticospinal tract descends. If the upper motor neurons are damaged or destroyed, as frequently occur with stroke or spinal cord injury, paralysis (loss of voluntary movement) results. However, because the inhibitory influences of intact upper motor neurons are impaired, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;reflex:&lt;/b&gt; an automatic response to stimuli">reflex</button></strong> (involuntary) movements are uninhibited, and hence hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, diminished or absent superficial reflexes, and pathologic reflexes such as a Babinski response occur. Severe leg spasms can occur as the result of an upper motor neuron lesion; the spasms result from the preserved reflex arc, which lacks inhibition along the spinal cord below the level of injury. There is little or no muscle atrophy, and muscles remain permanently tense, exhibiting spastic paralysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Paralysis associated with upper motor neuron lesions can affect a whole extremity, both extremities, or an entire half of the body. <em>Hemiplegia</em> (paralysis of an arm and leg on the same side of the body) can be the result of an upper motor neuron lesion. If hemorrhage, an embolus, or a thrombus destroys the fibers from the motor area in the internal capsule, the arm and the leg of the opposite side become stiff, weak, or paralyzed, and the reflexes are hyperactive. If both legs are paralyzed, the condition is called <em>paraplegia.</em> If all four extremities are paralyzed, the condition is called <em>tetraplegia</em> (quadriplegia). See <a href="c63.xhtml">Chapter 63</a> for additional discussion of these disorders.</p>
<p class="h8">Lower Motor Neuron Lesions</p>
<p class="nonindent">A patient is considered to have lower motor neuron damage if a motor nerve is damaged between the spinal cord and muscle. The result of lower motor neuron damage is muscle paralysis. Reflexes are lost, and the muscle becomes flaccid (limp) and atrophied from disuse. If the patient has injured the spinal trunk and it can heal, the use of muscles connected to that section of the spinal cord may be regained. However, if the anterior horn motor cells are destroyed, the nerves cannot regenerate, and the muscles are never useful again.</p>
<p class="indent">Flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the affected muscles are the principal signs of lower motor neuron disease. Lower motor neuron lesions can be the result of trauma, infection (poliomyelitis), toxins, vascular disorders, congenital malformations, degenerative processes, and neoplasms. Compression of nerve roots by herniated intervertebral discs is a common cause of lower motor neuron dysfunction.</p>
<p class="h7">Coordination of Movement</p>
<p class="nonindent">The motor system is complex, and motor function depends not only on the integrity of the corticospinal tracts but also on other pathways from the basal ganglia and cerebellum that control and coordinate voluntary motor function. The smoothness, accuracy, and strength that characterize the muscular movements of a normal person are attributable to the influence of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia.</p>
<p class="indent">Through the action of the cerebellum, the contractions of opposing muscle groups are adjusted in relation to each other to maximal mechanical advantage; muscle contractions can be sustained evenly at the desired tension and without significant fluctuation, and reciprocal movements can be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1977" title="1977"></span>reproduced at high and constant speed, in stereotyped fashion and with relatively little effort.</p>
<p class="indent">The basal ganglia play an important role in planning and coordinating motor movements and posture. Complex neural connections link the basal ganglia with the cerebral cortex. The major effect of these structures is to inhibit unwanted muscular activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Impaired cerebellar function, which may occur as a result of an intracranial injury or some type of an expanding mass (e.g., a hemorrhage, an abscess, or a tumor), results in loss of muscle tone, weakness, and fatigue. Depending on the area of the brain affected, the patient has different motor symptoms or responses. The patient may demonstrate abnormal flexion, abnormal extension, or flaccid posturing. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;flaccidity:&lt;/b&gt; displaying lack of muscle tone; limp, floppy">Flaccidity</button></strong> (lack of muscle tone) preceded by abnormal posturing in a patient with cerebral injury indicates severe neurologic impairment, which may herald brain death (<a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4301">Klein &#x0026; Stewart-Amidei, 2017</a>; <a href="c60-sec03.xhtml#bib4286">Posner, Saper, Schiff, et al., 2019</a>). See <a href="c61.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>, Figure 61-1 for further explanation of posturing.</p>
<p class="indent">Destruction or dysfunction of the basal ganglia leads not to paralysis but to muscle rigidity, disturbances of posture, and difficulty initiating or changing movement. The patient tends to have involuntary movements. These may take the form of coarse tremors, most often in the upper extremities, particularly in the distal portions; athetosis, which is movement of a slow, squirming, writhing, twisting type; or chorea, marked by spasmodic, purposeless, irregular, uncoordinated motions of the trunk and the extremities, and facial grimacing. Disorders affecting basal ganglia activity include Parkinson&#x2019;s and Huntington diseases (see <a href="c65.xhtml">Chapter 65</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sensory System Function</h6>
<p class="h7">Receiving Sensory Impulses</p>
<p class="nonindent">Afferent impulses travel from their points of origin to their destinations in the cerebral cortex via the ascending pathways directly, or they may cross at the level of the spinal cord or in the medulla, depending on the type of sensation carried. Knowledge of these pathways is important for neurologic assessment and for understanding symptoms and their relationship to various lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sensory impulses convey sensations of heat, cold, and pain; position; and vibration. The axons enter the spinal cord by way of the posterior root, specifically in the posterior gray columns of the spinal cord, where they connect with the cells of secondary neurons. Pain and temperature fibers (located in the spinothalamic tract) cross immediately to the opposite side of the cord and course upward to the thalamus. Fibers carrying sensations of touch, light pressure, and localization do not connect immediately with the second neuron but ascend the cord for a variable distance before entering the gray matter and completing this connection. The axon of the secondary neuron traverses the cord, crosses in the medulla, and proceeds upward to the thalamus.</p>
<p class="indent">Position and vibratory sensations are produced by stimuli arising from muscles, joints, and bones. These stimuli are conveyed, uncrossed, all the way to the brain stem by the axon of the primary neuron. In the medulla, synaptic connections are made with cells of the secondary neurons, whose axons cross to the opposite side and then proceed to the thalamus.</p>
<p class="h7">Integrating Sensory Impulses</p>
<p class="nonindent">The thalamus integrates all sensory impulses except olfaction. It plays a role in the conscious awareness of pain and the recognition of variation in temperature and touch. The thalamus is responsible for the sense of movement and position as well as the ability to recognize the size, shape, and quality of objects. Sensory information is relayed from the thalamus to the parietal lobe for interpretation.</p>
<p class="h7">Sensory Losses</p>
<p class="nonindent">Destruction of a sensory nerve results in total loss of sensation in its area of distribution (see <a href="#ff60-9">Fig. 60-9</a>). Lesions affecting the posterior spinal nerve roots may impair tactile sensation, causing intermittent severe pain that is referred to their areas of distribution. Destruction of the spinal cord yields complete anesthesia below the level of injury. Selective destruction or degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord is responsible for a loss of position and vibratory sense in segments distal to the lesion, without loss of touch, pain, or temperature perception. A cyst in the center of the spinal cord causes dissociation of sensation&#x2014;loss of pain at the level of the lesion. This occurs because the fibers carrying pain and temperature cross within the cord immediately on entering; thus, any lesion that divides the cord longitudinally divides these fibers. Other sensory fibers ascend the cord for variable distances, some even to the medulla, before crossing, thereby bypassing the lesion and avoiding destruction. Lesions in the thalamus or parietal lobe result in impaired touch, pain, temperature, and proprioceptive sensations.</p>
