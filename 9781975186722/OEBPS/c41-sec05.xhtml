<h4 class="h4" id="s1706">Celiac Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Celiac disease is a disorder of malabsorption caused by an autoimmune response to consumption of products that contain the protein gluten. Gluten is most commonly found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains, malt, dextrin, and brewer&#x2019;s yeast. Celiac disease has become more common in the past decade, with an estimated prevalence of 1% in the United States. Women are afflicted twice as often as men. This disease is more common among Caucasians, although the rates of celiac disease are on the rise among non-Caucasians. Celiac disease also has a familial risk component, particularly among first-degree relatives. Others at heightened risk include those with type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, and Turner syndrome. Celiac disease may manifest at any age in a person who is genetically predisposed (NIDDK, 2016a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1707">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nearly 30% of the population in the United States may be genetically predisposed to developing celiac disease. Individuals who are predisposed share a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II allele human leukocyte antigen (HLA), HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Those who develop celiac disease exhibit an autoimmune response to gluten products that is both humoral and cell mediated. It is not known what trigger or triggers may incite this autoimmune response, although it cannot occur if gluten is not ingested. As a result of this response, the epithelial cells that line the small intestines become inflamed, particularly the proximal portion, where most absorption of nutrients occurs. Eventually, the mucosal villi of the small intestine become denuded and cannot function. This results <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1296" title="1296"></span>in loss of ability to absorb both micronutrients and macronutrients, causing systemic nutritional deficits (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1708">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common GI clinical manifestations of celiac disease include diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, flatulence, and weight loss. However, these manifestations are more common among children than adults. Adults can present with non-GI signs and symptoms of celiac disease, which are highly variable and can include fatigue, general malaise, depression, hypothyroidism, migraine headaches, osteopenia, anemia, seizures, paresthesias in the hands and feet, and a red, shiny tongue. Some adults and children may evidence ridges in the enamel of their adult teeth, as well as discoloration or yellowing. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a rash that is frequently associated with celiac disease in adults; it manifests as clusters of erythematous macules that develop into itchy papules and vesicles on the forearms, elbows, knees, face, or buttocks (NIDDK, 2016a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1709">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A comprehensive assessment of the patient&#x2019;s presenting signs and symptoms, as well as a family history and risk factor assessment, may provide the first clues that the patient may have celiac disease. The definitive diagnosis is based upon a series of serologic tests and endoscopic biopsy. It is important that the patient continues to consume gluten products during testing, or there could be a false-negative serologic finding. The first serologic test is the immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG), which is 90% sensitive and 95% specific to celiac disease. Findings are confirmed with upper endoscopy with biopsies of the proximal small intestine (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Goebel, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1710">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Celiac disease is a chronic, noncurable, lifelong disease. There are no drugs that induce remission; the treatment is to refrain from exposure to gluten in foods and other products (see later discussion). A consultation with a dietician may be advisable. The patient should be advised that it will likely take time before bothersome signs and symptoms resolve; it will take a full year before the integrity of the intestinal villi can be restored. The patient should be cautioned that despite adhering to a gluten-free diet, symptoms can still occur and can have an impact on quality of life (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3104">Roos, Liedberg, Hellstr&#x00F6;m, et al., 2019</a>). Other manifestations of celiac disease may require specific, targeted treatment. For instance, patients who present with anemia may require folate, cobalamin, or iron supplements (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>). Patients with osteopenia may require treatment for osteoporosis (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1711">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse provides patient and family education regarding adherence to a gluten-free diet (see Chart 41-4), and how to avoid other gluten products. For instance, oats are not contraindicated in gluten-free diets; however, many oat products are produced in facilities that are cross-contaminated with wheat or other contraindicated grains. Likewise, gluten-free foods prepared in restaurants or dining areas that share preparatory space can become gluten-contaminated. For instance, gluten-free toast prepared in a toaster that is also used for wheat-based toast can become gluten-contaminated. Patients must become vigilant in asking restaurant and dining hall staff about how gluten-free foods are prepared.</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>How to Avoid Gluten</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to choose foods that are naturally gluten-free such as:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Fresh fruits and vegetables</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Meat and poultry</p>

<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Corn, rice, soy, quinoa, and potato</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse instructs the patient to avoid foods that commonly contain gluten, including the following:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wheat (wheat-free does not mean gluten-free), barley, bran, durum, spelt, faro, rye, bulgur, graham, semolina, farina, emmer, and triticale; these are generally used in:</p>
<p class="Box3BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cakes, pastries, cookies</p>
<p class="Box3BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Breads, pastas, rolls, pizza, crackers</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Brewer&#x2019;s yeast; this generally includes beer, ale, and porter</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Malt, malt extract, and malt flavoring</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Modified food starch made from wheat (commonly contained in sour cream)</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse instructs the patient to exercise caution and carefully read labels on foods,<em><sup>a</sup></em> particularly before consuming the following:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Candies (gluten-free candy list is available on Celiac Disease Foundation site)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Caramel-colored foods</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cornflakes and puffed rice cereals (these often contain malt flavoring or extract, which contains gluten)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Oat products not specifically labeled as produced in gluten-free facilities</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Processed lunch meats and &#x201C;shaped&#x201D; foods (e.g., cheese sticks)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Salad dressings, condiments, soy sauce, seasonings</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Sauces (wheat is often used as thickening agent)</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Soft drinks</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara"><sup>a</sup>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standard for &#x201C;gluten-free&#x201D; is that the product must contain less than 200 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Adapted from Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten-Free Living. Retrieved on 2/29/2020 at: <a href="http://celiac.org/gluten-free-living/gluten-free-foods/">celiac.org/gluten-free-living/gluten-free-foods/</a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Products that are not foods can also contain gluten. Many generic and over-the-counter drugs can be prepared with gluten gels. Toothpastes, communion wafers, and some cosmetics (e.g., lipsticks) and art supplies (e.g., modeling clay) can also contain gluten. Patients must understand how to carefully read labels on both foods and nonfood products to determine if they contain gluten. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates and monitors the appropriate application of gluten-free labels.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec14"><strong>ACUTE ABDOMEN</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An acute abdomen, sometimes called a <em>surgical abdomen</em> is characterized by an acute onset of abdominal pain that does not have a traumatic etiology and that most typically requires swift surgical intervention to prevent peritonitis, sepsis, and septic shock. Disorders of the lower GI tract that may cause similar initial presenting clinical manifestations, causing acute abdominal pain and an acute abdomen include appendicitis, severe diverticulitis, and intestinal obstruction, all of which may lead to peritonitis.</p>
