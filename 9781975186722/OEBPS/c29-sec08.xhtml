<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lymphopenia:&lt;/b&gt; a lymphocyte count less than 1500/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;">Lymphopenia</button></strong> is defined as a lymphocyte count less than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup>. It may occur as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation, long-term use of corticosteroids, uremia, infections (particularly viral infections), neoplasms (breast and lung cancer and advanced Hodgkin disease), and some protein-losing enteropathies which may cause lymphocytes from the GI tract to be lost (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Vasu &#x0026; Caligiuri, 2016</a>). When lymphopenia is mild, there are no serious sequelae, but when it is severe, it can result in bacterial infections (due to reduced B lymphocytes) or in opportunistic infections (due to reduced T lymphocytes). T-lymphocyte depletion is frequently associated with viral infections, including human immune deficiency virus (HIV). Excessive or prolonged use of alcohol can also impair lymphocyte production; lymphocyte counts can improve when alcohol intake is discontinued (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Vasu &#x0026; Caligiuri, 2016</a>).</p>
