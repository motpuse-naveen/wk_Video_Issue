<p class="nonindent">The urinary system is responsible for providing the route for drainage of urine formed by the kidneys. Care of the patient with disorders of the urinary tract requires an understanding of the anatomy, physiology, diagnostic testing, medical, and nursing care, as well as rehabilitation of patients with the multiple processes that affect the urinary system. Nurses care for patients with urologic disorders in all settings. This chapter focuses on the nursing management of patients with common urinary dysfunctions, including infections, dysfunctional voiding patterns, urolithiasis, genitourinary trauma, cancer of the urinary tract, and urinary diversions.</p>
