<p class="nonindent">Disorders of the female reproductive system can be minor or serious but are often anxiety producing and distressing. Some disorders are self-limited and cause only minor inconvenience; others are life-threatening and require immediate attention and long-term therapy. Many disorders are managed by the patient at home, whereas others require hospitalization and surgical intervention. Nurses not only need to be knowledgeable about these disorders but need to be sensitive to patient concerns and possible discomfort in discussing and managing these disorders.</p>
