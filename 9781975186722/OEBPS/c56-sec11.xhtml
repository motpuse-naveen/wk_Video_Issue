<h4 class="h4" id="s2619">Bacterial Skin Infections</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Also called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pyodermas:&lt;/b&gt; pus-forming bacterial skin infections">pyodermas</button></strong>, pus-forming bacterial infections of the skin may be primary or secondary. Primary skin infections originate in previously normal-appearing skin and are usually caused by a single organism. Secondary skin infections arise from a preexisting skin disorder or from disruption <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1835" title="1835"></span>of the skin integrity from injury or surgery. In either case, several microorganisms may be implicated (e.g., <em>Staphylococcus aureus,</em> group A streptococci). Common primary bacterial skin infections are impetigo and folliculitis. Folliculitis may lead to furuncles or carbuncles.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m1">Impetigo</p>
<p class="nonindent">Impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin caused by staphylococci, streptococci, or multiple bacteria. Bullous impetigo, a more deep-seated infection of the skin caused by <em>S</em>. <em>aureus,</em> is characterized by the formation of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bullae:&lt;/b&gt; large, fluid-filled blisters">bullae</button></strong> (i.e., large, fluid-filled blisters) from original vesicles. The bullae rupture, leaving raw, red areas. Nonbullous impetigo accounts for approximately 70% of the cases. This type of impetigo tends to affect skin that has already been disrupted by cuts, abrasions, bites, or other types of trauma. <em>S</em>. <em>aureus</em> is also commonly implicated, including methicillin-resistant <em>S</em>. <em>aureus</em> (MRSA) and gentamycin-resistant <em>S</em>. <em>aureus</em>, as well as <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The exposed areas of the body, face, hands, neck, and extremities are most frequently involved. Impetigo is contagious and may spread to other parts of the patient&#x2019;s skin or to other members of the family who touch the patient or use towels or combs that are soiled with the exudate of the lesions (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Impetigo is seen in people of all races and ages. It is particularly common in children living in poor hygienic conditions. Chronic health problems, poor hygiene, and malnutrition may predispose an adult to impetigo. It is more prevalent in warm, humid climates and is therefore more commonly seen in the southeastern United States than in northern climates (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2620">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The lesions of impetigo are most commonly seen on the face or extremities. They begin as small, red macules, which quickly become discrete, thin-walled vesicles that rupture and become covered with a loosely adherent honey-yellow crust (<a href="#ff56-4">Fig. 56-4</a>). These crusts are easily removed to reveal smooth, red, moist surfaces on which new crusts soon develop (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2621">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Topical antibacterial therapy (e.g., mupirocin, retapamulin) is typically prescribed when the disease is limited to a small area. The medication must be applied to the lesions several times daily for 5 to 7 days. Lesions are first soaked or washed with soap solution to remove the central site of bacterial growth, giving the topical antibiotic an opportunity to reach the infected site. After the crusts are removed, the prescribed topical antibiotic cream is applied. Gloves are worn when providing patient care (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Systemic antibiotic agents may be prescribed to treat infections that are widespread or in cases where there are systemic manifestations (e.g., fever is present). These antibiotics are effective in reducing contagious spread, treating deep infections, and preventing acute glomerulonephritis (kidney infection), which may occur as a consequence of streptococcal skin diseases. Amoxicillin&#x2013;clavulanate, cloxacillin, or dicloxacillin may be prescribed. In cases where MRSA is present, antibiotics prescribed may include clindamycin, trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2622">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient and family members to bathe at least once daily with bactericidal soap. Cleanliness and good hygiene practices help to prevent the spread of the lesions from one skin area to another and from one person to another. In particular, patients and family members must be educated to practice hand hygiene every time after a lesion is touched. Each person should have a separate towel and washcloth. Because impetigo is a contagious disorder, people who are infected should avoid contact with other people until the lesions heal (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Lewis, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m2">Folliculitis, Furuncles, and Carbuncles</p>
<p class="nonindent">Infectious folliculitis is an inflammatory condition of the cells within the wall and ostia of the hair follicles that may be caused by a bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection. Lesions may be superficial or deep. Single or multiple papules or pustules appear close to the hair follicles. Folliculitis can affect any hairy part of the body, most commonly the beard area of men who shave, as well as women&#x2019;s legs, if they shave. Other commonly affected areas include the axillae, trunk, and buttocks (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Pseudofolliculitis barbae (shaving bumps) occur predominantly on the faces of Black men as a result of shaving. The sharp ingrowing hairs have a curved root that grows at a more acute angle and pierces the skin, provoking an irritative reaction. The only entirely effective treatment is to avoid shaving. Other treatments include using special lotions or antibiotics or using a hand brush to dislodge the hairs mechanically. If the patient must remove facial hair, a depilatory cream or electric razor may be used.</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;furuncle:&lt;/b&gt; localized skin infection of a single or a few hair follicles (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: boil)">furuncle</button></strong> (boil) is an acute inflammation arising deep in one or more hair follicles and spreading into the surrounding dermis (<a href="#ff56-5">Fig. 56-5</a>). This inflammation is a deep form of folliculitis. Furunculosis refers to multiple or recurrent lesions. Furuncles may occur anywhere on the body but are more prevalent in areas subjected to irritation, pressure, friction, and excessive perspiration, such as the back of the neck, the axillae, and the buttocks.</p>
<p class="indent">A furuncle may start as a small, red, raised, painful pimple. Frequently, the infection progresses and involves the skin <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1836" title="1836"></span>and subcutaneous fatty tissue, causing tenderness, pain, and cellulitis. The area of redness and induration represents an effort of the body to keep the infection localized. The bacteria (usually staphylococci) produce necrosis of the invaded tissue (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Motswaledi, 2018</a>). The characteristic pointing of a boil follows in a few days. When this occurs, the center becomes yellow or black, and the boil is said to have &#x201C;come to a head.&#x201D;</p>

<p class="indent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;carbuncle:&lt;/b&gt; localized skin infection involving several hair follicles">carbuncle</button></strong> is an abscess of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that represents an extension of a furuncle that has invaded several follicles and is large and deep seated. It is usually caused by a staphylococcal infection. Carbuncles appear most commonly in areas where the skin is thick and inelastic; the back of the neck and the back are common sites (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Ahmad &#x0026; Siddiqui, 2017</a>). The extensive inflammation frequently prevents a complete walling off of the infection; purulent material may be absorbed, resulting in high fever, pain, leukocytosis, and sepsis.</p>
<p class="indent">Furuncles and carbuncles are more likely to occur in older adult patients with underlying systemic diseases, such as diabetes or hematologic malignancies, and in those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases. Both are more prevalent in hot climates, especially on skin beneath occlusive clothing (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Ahmad &#x0026; Siddiqui, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2623">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In treating staphylococcal infections, it is important not to rupture or destroy the protective wall of induration that localizes the infection. The boil or pimple should never be squeezed. Systemic antibiotic therapy, selected by culture and sensitivity study, is generally indicated. Oral dicloxacillin and cephalosporins are first-line medications. If MRSA is suspected, antibiotic agents selected may include clindamycin, trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, or minocycline (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Harris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When the pus has localized and is fluctuant, a small incision with a scalpel can speed resolution by relieving the tension and ensuring direct evacuation of the pus and debris. The patient is instructed to keep the draining lesion covered with a dressing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2624">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Intravenous (IV) fluids, fever reduction, and other supportive treatments are indicated for patients who are acutely ill from infection. Warm, moist compresses hasten resolution of the furuncle or carbuncle. The surrounding skin may be cleansed gently with antibacterial soap, and an antibacterial ointment may be applied. Soiled dressings are handled according to standard precautions. Nursing personnel should carefully follow standard precautions to avoid becoming carriers of staphylococci.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Nurses must take special precautions in caring for boils on the patient&#x2019;s face because the skin area drains directly into the cranial venous sinuses. Sinus thrombosis can develop after manipulating a boil in this location. The infection can travel through the sinus tract and penetrate the brain cavity, causing a brain abscess.</em></p></div>

<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">To prevent and control staphylococcal skin infections such as boils and carbuncles, the staphylococcal pathogen must be eliminated from the skin and environment. Efforts must be made to provide a hygienic environment. If lesions are actively draining, the mattress and pillow should be covered with plastic material and wiped with disinfectant daily; the bed linens, towels, and clothing should be laundered after each use; and the patient should use an antibacterial soap and shampoo for an indefinite period, often several months.</p>
