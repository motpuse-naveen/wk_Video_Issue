<h4 class="h4" id="s428">Settings for Palliative Care and End-of-Life Care</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As the landscape of care at the end-of-life moved from the home to a more institutionalized death, the models of palliative care delivery changed as well. At hospice&#x2019;s inception, end-of-life care was home based or at a free-standing hospice. Palliative care was largely hospital based; it was born out of academic medical centers, where some health care providers felt that everyone deserves to receive treatment based on the tenets of hospice care throughout the progression of serious illness (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Morrison, 2013</a>). Current models for palliative and end-of-life care delivery will be described in greater detail in the following sections and include (NCP, 2018):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Institution-based palliative care programs (e.g., programs within hospitals or long-term care facilities)</span></li>
<li><span>Outpatient-based palliative care programs (e.g., outpatient clinics, ambulatory settings)</span></li>
<li><span>Community-based palliative care program (consultative teams collaborate with hospice or home health agencies, to support patients not yet receiving hospice care in their place of residence)</span></li>
<li><span>Hospice care (under Medicare Part A)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">As our population ages and is expected to develop multiple comorbidities, the need for a palliative care workforce also grows. Yet, experts project a workforce shortage of all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page370" title="370"></span>palliative clinicians that may not recover for nearly three decades. Proposed policy changes include (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1142">Kamal, Wolf, Troy, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>):</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s429">Institution-Based Palliative Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The landmark Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) documented troubling deficiencies in the care of the dying in hospital settings (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1172">SUPPORT Principal Investigators, 1995</a>). Subsequently, the IOM&#x2019;s <em>Dying in America</em> (2014), the NCP <em>Clinical Practice Guidelines</em> (2018), and the ANA-HPNA <em>Call for Action</em> (2017a) have been shaping palliative and end-of-life care through developing and encouraging adherence to standards of care for patients with advanced illness and at end-of-life that will apply regardless of where the patients are receiving care (ANA, 2017a; IOM, 2014; NCP, 2018). There has been a steady increase in American hospital-based palliative care, with reportedly 90% of hospitals with 300 beds or more offering palliative care, compared to 56% of hospitals with fewer than 300 beds (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1123">Dumanovsky, Augustin, Rogers, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In the hospital, the delivery of palliative care is typically through an interdisciplinary consultation service where primary teams consult specialists for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Pain management</span></li>
<li><span>Symptom management</span></li></ul>
<p class="BL1Middle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page371" title="371"></span><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Goals of care discussions</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>End-of-life issues</span></li>
<li><span>Psychosocial distress</span></li>
<li><span>Spiritual or existential distress</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The core interdisciplinary team usually consists of physicians, nurses, advanced practice nurses, social workers, and chaplains (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1155">National Palliative Care Registry, 2017</a>). Additional team members may include pharmacists, nutritionists, music or art therapists, ethicists, and psychologists. Occasionally, institutions have palliative care units where palliative care clinicians oversee a patient&#x2019;s care when palliative care needs supersede other hospital conditions. The most common reason for palliative care consultation in the hospital setting is goals of care discussion; those referred for care planning are most often older with a serious illness other than cancer and typically have a full code status (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1108">Bischoff, O&#x2019;Riordan, Marks, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In 2011, The Joint Commission launched an advanced certification program for palliative care to recognize hospitals that provide exceptional patient and family-centered care (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1176">The Joint Commission, 2018</a>). The Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) has a plethora of institutional resources for developing hospital&#x2013;hospice partnerships to provide high-quality palliative care for hospitalized patients and for addressing the palliative care needs of other specialized populations. See Resources section at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the National Palliative Care Registry in 2017, the most common primary diagnoses seen by palliative care specialists included cancer (26%), cardiac diseases (15%), pulmonary conditions (9%), neurologic diagnoses (9%), and infectious causes (7%). For patients with diagnoses for which palliative care specialists have rarely been consulted, the efficacy of palliative care has been demonstrated. In one study, for example, patients undergoing stem cell transplant at an academic medical center reported better quality of life during transplant hospitalization after palliative care intervention (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1124">El-Jawahri, LeBlanc, VanDusen, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Researchers have reported that seriously ill hospitalized patients who receive palliative care consultations for goals of care have lower future health care utilization and cost (O&#x2019;Connor, Junker, Appel, et&#x00A0;al., 2018). Despite the growth of palliative care, many believe that palliative care resources are still lacking; in a survey of administrators and clinicians, respondents felt that 60% of patients who may benefit from palliative or end-of-life care do not receive this type of support (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Compton-Phillips &#x0026; Mohta, 2019</a>). Additionally, there is ample room for improvement in end-of-life care delivery. Hospital end-of-life care has been found to be of higher quality in hospitals with better rated nurse practice environments (as measured by the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index survey, where nurse workload, autonomy, and interdisciplinary collaboration are favored); however, the majority of nurses rated overall end-of-life care in hospitals unfavorably (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1144">Lasater, Sloane, McHugh, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Experts estimate that the number of people who will need some form of short- or long-term skilled nursing care in their lifetimes, whether in the community or in a residential care facility, is likely to increase exponentially (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1184">West et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). As a result, the likely place of death for a growing number of Americans after the age of 65 years will be a skilled nursing facility. A 2018 study by Teno and colleagues found that, among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, the proportion of death in acute care hospitals has decreased, yet one in five beneficiaries continues to die in acute care settings. More than one in four (29%) fee-for-service beneficiaries are admitted to intensive care units in the last 30 days of their life. Based on recent trends, about two in five (40%) of fee-for-service beneficiaries die at home and community settings, including assisted living facilities. Nursing homes remain the site of death for 25% of Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, while dying at home has increased for those older than age 65 in recent years, deaths in other locations still exceed the number of deaths occurring at home (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1175">Teno, Gozalo, Trivedi, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Residents of skilled nursing facilities typically have poor access to palliative care. Regulations that govern how care in these facilities is organized and reimbursed tend to emphasize restorative measures and serve as a disincentive to palliative care. Since 1989, home hospice programs have been permitted to enroll long-term care facility residents in hospice programs and to provide interdisciplinary services to residents who qualify for hospice care. Of over one million Medicare beneficiaries who received hospice services in 2016, close to a third resided in long-term care facilities, an increase from 14.5% in 2013 to 32.8% (NHPCO, 2018). Because hospices provide some services that may overlap with services provided by the skilled nursing provider, payment models have been developed to define and reconcile duplication of services. In 1997, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), an oversight arm of the federal government, questioned whether hospice services in nursing homes were an unnecessary duplication of services already provided by long-term care facility staff. Hospice/skilled nursing facility contracts continue to be scrutinized by federal regulators. More recently, facilities are under increasing public pressure to improve care of the dying and are beginning to develop palliative care units or services; continuing to contract with home hospice programs to provide palliative care consultations and hospice care in the facilities; and to educate staff, residents, and their families about pain and symptom management and end-of-life care. Many skilled nursing providers have implemented culture change innovations such as resident-centered care plans and consistent staff assignments to change the experience of long-term skilled nursing care. In nursing homes, &#x201C;comfort measures&#x201D; are used to identify residents who do not wish to receive life-sustaining interventions. Nevertheless, hospitalizations continue to occur and research reports that 77% of events (i.e., fall, change in mental status, or development of a new symptom) are unavoidable, yet opportunities exist for improvement in communication and monitoring (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1179">Unroe, O&#x2019;Kelly Phillips, Effler, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Palliative care education and training for nursing home staff may improve the quality of care residents receive at the end-of-life.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s430">Outpatient-Based Palliative Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As palliative care has become more prevalent in hospitals, skilled nursing settings, and in home hospice programs, outpatient palliative care has emerged as an approach to providing services and support to patients and families who opt not to, or are not eligible for, home hospice but could benefit from comprehensive palliative care in the community. Outpatient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page372" title="372"></span>palliative care benefits both patients and their families and other providers by providing expert consultation and management of symptoms and other needs. A growing body of evidence supports the role of palliative care that is delivered <em>concurrently</em> with standard medical treatment. For example, in a landmark study of outpatient referral to palliative care for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic non&#x2013;small cell lung carcinoma (a disease with very poor prognosis), researchers found that those patients randomized to the palliative care plus standard oncology care arm of the trial not only showed improved quality of life and mood, but also had longer median survival than those who received standard oncology care alone (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1174">Temel, Greer, Muzikansky, et&#x00A0;al., 2010</a>). Such studies underscore the value of palliative care.</p>
<p class="indent">Models for palliative care in ambulatory clinics vary and include independent clinics, colocated clinics and embedded practices (Finlay, Newport, Sivendran, et&#x00A0;al., 2019). Each model differs in the referral process, financial makeup, staffing and population served (Finlay et&#x00A0;al., 2019). In addition, clinics may follow a consultative only, comanagement with one or shared opioid prescribing (Finlay et&#x00A0;al., 2019). Although many outpatient palliative care clinics start with oncology patients, as palliative care has gained traction in many disease states in the hospital, other medical specialties (cardiologists, pulmonologist, nephrologists, etc.) are lacking proper palliative care follow-up and requesting nononcology palliative care clinics.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s431">Community-Based Palliative Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Home-based primary care has become more common due to the aging of society and a desire for people to remain at home rather than live in an institution (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Schuchman, Fain, &#x0026; Cornwell, 2018</a>). Home-based primary care incorporates palliative care skills, and specialty palliative care home programs have developed with the goal of managing symptoms and providing support in the home. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, also included new payment models for home-based palliative care in an effort to reduce hospital readmissions and mortality (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Morrison, 2013</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s432">Hospice Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The broadening of the application of palliative care in the United States actually <em>followed</em> the development of hospice programs. All hospice care is palliative care; however, not all palliative care is hospice care. The difference is that hospice care is an application of palliative care delivered at the end-of-life. Hospice care focuses on quality of life, and by necessity, it usually includes realistic emotional, social, spiritual, and financial preparation for death. Hospice in the United States is not a <em>place</em> but a philosophy of care in which the end-of-life is viewed as a developmental stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Originally, the concept of hospice care as an alternative to depersonalized death in institutions began in the early 1970s as a volunteer-based, grassroots, and spiritually centered movement (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1148">Meghani, 2004</a>). In 2016, there were 4382 hospice programs in operation across all 50 states (as well as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico), serving an estimated 1.43 million patients (NHPCO, 2018). Currently the most common diagnosis for hospice patients in the United States is cancer (<a href="#tt13-1">Table&#x00A0;13-1</a>). While median length of hospice stay in 2016 was approximately 24 days across diagnoses, for patients with dementia, the average length of stay was 104 days (NHPCO, 2018).</p>

<p class="indent">After hospice care was recognized as a distinct program of services under Medicare in early 1983, organizations providing hospice care were able to receive Medicare reimbursement if they could demonstrate that the hospice program met the Medicare conditions of participation, or regulations for hospice providers as enforced by the Centers for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Services (CMS, 2019). In many aspects, Medicare standards have come to largely define hospice philosophy and services. State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) also provides coverage for hospice care, as do most commercial insurers.</p>
<p class="indent">Hospice is a coordinated program of interdisciplinary services provided by professional caregivers and trained volunteers to patients with serious, progressive illnesses that are not responsive to cure. The root of the word <em>hospice</em> is <em>hospes,</em> meaning &#x201C;host.&#x201D; According to Cicely Saunders, who founded the world-renowned St. Christopher&#x2019;s Hospice in London, the principles underlying hospice are as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Death must be accepted.</span></li>
<li><span>The patient&#x2019;s total care is best managed by an interdisciplinary team whose members communicate regularly with one another.</span></li>
<li><span>Pain and other symptoms of terminal illness must be managed.</span></li>
<li><span>The patient and the family should be viewed as a single unit of care.</span></li>
<li><span>Home care of the dying is necessary.</span></li>
<li><span>Bereavement care must be provided to family members.</span></li>
<li><span>Research and education should be ongoing.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The goal of hospice is to enable the patient to remain at home, surrounded by the people and objects that have been important to them throughout life. The patient and the family comprise the unit of care. Hospice care does not seek to hasten death or encourage the prolongation of life through artificial means.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite more than 45 years of existence in the United States and the early calls for its concurrent integration with disease-modifying treatments (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1148">Meghani, 2004</a>), hospice remains an option for end-of-life care that has not been fully integrated into mainstream health care. Reasons include the difficulties in making a terminal prognosis (especially for those patients with noncancer diagnoses), the strong association of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page373" title="373"></span>hospice with death, advances in &#x201C;curative&#x201D; treatment options in late-stage illness, and financial pressures on health care providers that may cause them to retain rather than refer patients who are eligible for hospice. Moreover, there are significant racial differences in the utilization of hospice care; for example, Asian Americans tend to have shorter lengths of hospice stay, and non-White patients have a higher incidence of revoking hospice when compared to White patients (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1181">Wang, Hsu, Aldridge, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Medicare-certified hospice is paid a predetermined dollar amount for each day of hospice care that each patient receives. Four levels of hospice care are covered under Medicare and Medicaid hospice benefits: (1) routine care, (2) continuous care, (3) respite care, and (4) general inpatient hospice care. Most hospice care is provided at the &#x201C;routine home care&#x201D; level; routine and continuous care are outlined in greater detail in <a href="#ct13-2">Chart&#x00A0;13-2</a>. According to federal guidelines, hospices may provide no more than 20% of the aggregate annual patient-days at the inpatient level. Respite care allows primary caregivers a break through admission of the patient to an inpatient unit or nursing facility.</p>
<p class="indent">Federal rules for hospices require that eligibility be reviewed periodically. Patients who live longer than 6 months under hospice care are <em>not</em> discharged, provided that their primary provider and the hospice medical director continue to certify that they are terminally ill with a life expectancy of 6 months or less (assuming that the disease continues its expected course). Thus, the patient is re-certified and continues to receive hospice benefits. Once a patient meets eligibility criteria and elects to use the benefit, the Medicare-certified hospice program assumes responsibility for providing and paying for the care and treatment to palliate the terminal illness for which hospice care was elected. Patients may revoke their hospice benefits at any time, resuming traditional coverage under Medicare or Medicaid for the terminal illness. Those who revoke their benefits may also reelect to use them at a later time.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;Medicare Hospice Benefit:&lt;/b&gt; a Medicare Part A entitlement that provides for comprehensive, interdisciplinary palliative care and services for eligible beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of less than 6 months">Medicare Hospice Benefit</button></strong> requirement that beneficiaries make a choice between palliative care (to enroll in hospice) and cure-focused treatment has long been a barrier to earlier hospice enrollment. A Medicare beneficiary could not receive BOTH palliative care and cure-focused care under their hospice benefit. The Affordable Care Act authorized a study of concurrent palliative and curative care services. Under this federally funded study, titled Medicare Care Choices, CMS is evaluating whether beneficiaries would choose palliative care under hospice guidelines while they <em>continue to receive</em> cure-focused care (CMS, 2018). The model is being tested with 104 hospices currently participating and 1092 Medicare patients receiving this concurrent care, with a hope to reach 150,000 in the coming years (CMS, 2018).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/veteransconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The Veterans Administration (VA) offers concurrent care, whereby a veteran has the option to receive disease-directed therapy, such as radiation or chemotherapy, while receiving hospice care. The VA reported that veterans with cancer at the end-of-life received radiation and chemotherapy at the same rate as before concurrent care was offered, but the utilization of hospice increased, thus allowing patients to receive significant support in the last weeks of life (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1151">Mor, Joyce, Cote, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s433">Communication in Palliative Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Expert communication is a tenet of palliative and end-of-life care. Historically, communication was thought of as an innate art. Experts now view communication as a set of skills that can be taught, practiced, and built upon. Nurses need to develop skill and comfort in assessing patients&#x2019; and families&#x2019; responses to serious illness and planning interventions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page374" title="374"></span>that support their values and choices throughout the continuum of care (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1094">Wittenberg-Lyles, Goldsmith, Ferrell, et&#x00A0;al., 2013</a>). To develop a level of comfort and expertise in communicating with seriously and terminally ill patients and their families, nurses must first consider their own experiences with and values concerning illness and death through reflection, discussion with colleagues, reading, and self-discovery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Skills for Communicating with the Seriously Ill</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Throughout the course of a serious illness, patients and their families encounter complicated treatment options and bad news about disease progression. They may have to make difficult decisions at the time of diagnosis, when disease-focused treatment fails, when the effectiveness of a particular intervention is being discussed, and when decisions about hospice care are presented. These critical points on the treatment continuum demand patience, empathy, and honesty from nurses. Over the years, many communication training models have been developed to improve goals of care and end-of-life conversations (<a href="#tt13-2">Table&#x00A0;13-2</a>). One such program, the Serious Illness Conversation Project (SICP) communication guide, has helped clinicians have earlier, more thorough, and more accessible conversations around patients&#x2019; values, worries, and preferences (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1159">Paladino, Bernacki, Neville, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Therapeutic communication can be learned and, like other skills, must be practiced to gain expertise. Like other skills, communication should be practiced in a safe setting, such as a classroom or clinical skills laboratory with other students and clinicians. One skill that nurses have the opportunity to master is responding to emotion. Nurses often meet patients in vulnerable states experiencing strong emotions such as anxiety, anger, fear, and sadness. The NURSE framework (<a href="#tt13-3">Table&#x00A0;13-3</a>) should be considered when a patient expresses an emotion. Typically, the nurse would choose one response listed at a time.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients often direct questions or concerns to nurses before they have been able to fully discuss the details of their diagnosis and prognosis with their primary providers or the entire health care team. Using open-ended questions allows the nurse to elicit the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s concerns, explore misconceptions and needs for information, and form the basis for collaboration with primary providers and other team members. <a href="#ct13-3">Chart&#x00A0;13-3</a> provides sample language for exploring a patient&#x2019;s values and preferences. In practice, communication with each patient and family should be tailored to their particular level of understanding and values concerning disclosure.</p>

<h6 class="h6">The Role of the Nurse in Family Meetings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Family meetings, prompted by either the patient and family or the care team, are often held to clarify goals, address concerns, and formulate a plan. The objectives of a family meeting are to both gather information and share information. Family meetings may be held at any time during a serious illness and should especially be arranged when new diagnostic information is available. More often than not, difficult news is shared at a family meeting. As such, patient and family members may become emotional and the nurse has the unique opportunity to offer support (see <a href="#tt13-3">Table&#x00A0;13-3</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Before a family meeting, the nurse in collaboration with the primary team can perform a stakeholder analysis to ensure that important people are present. The nurse can ask the patient who helps them make decisions and help arrange for their presence. Engaging integral medical team members and consults is important to ensure that experts can answer all patient and family questions. The nurse can assure the patient that they will be present at the meeting to support the patient. The nurse can also ensure the setting is right&#x2014;free from disturbances, private, ample seating.

Nurses play an integral role in ACP. With the proper training and understanding of ACP, nurses should feel empowered to engage with patients about their goals of care and, when applicable, assist patients with completion of ACP documentation (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1220">Izumi, 2017</a>).

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Methods of Stating End-of-Life Preferences</strong></p>
<p class="BoxUL1First"><strong>Advance directives:</strong> written documents that allow the person of sound mind to document preferences regarding end-of-life care that should be followed when the signer is terminally ill and unable to verbally communicate their wishes. The documents are generally completed in advance of serious illness but may be completed after a diagnosis of serious illness if the signer is still of sound mind. The most common types are the durable power of attorney for health care and the living will.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First"><strong>Do not resuscitate:</strong> a medical order to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the event of cardiac arrest. In some settings, the term &#x201C;allow natural death&#x201D; (AND) is used in place of &#x201C;do not resuscitate&#x201D; (DNR).</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First"><strong>Durable power of attorney for health care:</strong> a legal document through which the signer appoints and authorizes another person to make medical decisions on their behalf when they are no longer able to speak for themselves. This is also known as a health care power of attorney, medical power of attorney, or a proxy directive.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First"><strong>Living will:</strong> a type of advance directive in which the individual documents treatment preferences. It provides instructions for care in the event that the signer is terminally ill and not able to communicate their wishes directly and often is accompanied by a durable power of attorney for health care. This is also known as a medical directive or treatment directive.</p>
<p class="BoxUL1First"><strong>Physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST):</strong> a form that translates patient preferences expressed in advance directives to medical &#x201C;orders&#x201D; that are transferable across settings and readily available to all health care providers, including emergency medical personnel. The POLST form is a brightly colored form that specifies preferences related to CPR, intubation, artificial nutrition and hydration, antibiotics, and other medical interventions. The form is signed by the patient or surrogate and the primary provider, advanced practice nurse, or physician assistant. The use of the POLST is subject to state laws and regulations. Numerous states have endorsed the POLST or a similar form and some states have implemented electronic registries and electronic versions of POLST forms (e.g., New York&#x2019;s e-MOLST program).</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Information about the advance care planning and state-specific advance directive documents and instructions is available at <a href="http://www.caringinfo.org">www.caringinfo.org</a>. Information about the POLST is available at <a href="http://www.polst.org">www.polst.org</a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now legally sanctioned in every state and federally sanctioned through the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1991, advance directives are written documents that allow competent people to document their preferences regarding the use or abatement of medical treatment at the end-of-life, specify their preferred setting for care, and communicate other valuable insights into their values and beliefs. These documents are widely available from health care providers, community organizations, bookstores, and from trusted Web sites. Unfortunately, ACP documents remain underutilized, as a systematic review found that only one in three Americans have completed any advanced directive (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1188">Yadav, Gabler, Cooney, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Data was similar for those with chronic illnesses and healthy adults in this study. The underuse of advanced directives may reflect society&#x2019;s continued discomfort with openly confronting the subject of death. Furthermore, the existence of a properly executed advance directive does not reduce the complexity of end-of-life decisions.</p>
<p class="indent">The Patient Self-Determination Act requires that health care entities receiving Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement must ask whether patients have advance directives, provide information about advance directives, and incorporate advance directives into the medical record. However, advance directives should not be considered a substitute for ongoing communication among the health care provider, patient, and family as the end-of-life approaches.</p>
