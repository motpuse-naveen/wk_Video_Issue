<p class="nonindent">The decision to perform surgery may be based on facilitating a diagnosis (a diagnostic procedure such as biopsy, exploratory laparotomy, or laparoscopy), a cure (e.g., excision of a tumor or an inflamed appendix), or repair (e.g., multiple wound repair). It may be reconstructive or cosmetic (such as mammoplasty or a facelift) or palliative (to relieve pain or correct a problem&#x2014;such as debulking a tumor to achieve comfort, or removal of a dysfunctional gallbladder). In addition, surgery might be rehabilitative (e.g., total joint replacement surgery to correct crippling pain or progression of degenerative osteoarthritis). Surgery can also be classified based upon the degree of urgency involved: emergent, urgent, required, elective, and optional (see <a href="c14-sec05.xhtml#tt14-1">Table&#x00A0;14-1</a>).</p>
