<h4 class="h4" id="s2906">Hearing Aids</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A hearing aid is a device through which speech and environmental sounds are received by a microphone, converted to electrical signals, amplified, and reconverted to acoustic signals. Many aids available for sensorineural hearing loss depress the low frequencies, or tones, and enhance hearing for the high frequencies. A general guideline for assessing the patient&#x2019;s need for a hearing aid is a hearing loss exceeding 30&#x00A0;dB in the range of 500 to 2000 Hz in the better-hearing ear.</p>
<p class="indent">A hearing aid makes sounds louder, but it does not improve a patient&#x2019;s ability to discriminate words or understand speech. People who have low discrimination scores (i.e., 20%) on audiograms may derive little benefit from a hearing aid. Hearing aids amplify all sounds, including background noise, which may be particularly disturbing to the first-time wearer. Chart&#x00A0;59-11 identifies additional problems associated with hearing aid use. Computerized hearing aids are available to compensate for background noise or allow amplification at certain programmed frequencies rather than at all frequencies. Occasionally, depending on the type of hearing loss, binaural aids (i.e., one for each ear) may be indicated. Chart&#x00A0;59-12 provides tips for hearing aid care.</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Tips for Hearing Aid Care</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient how to clean a hearing aid, check for malfunctions, and recognize complications:</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Cleaning</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep in mind that the ear mold is the only part of the hearing aid that may be washed frequently.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wash the ear mold daily with soap and water.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Allow the ear mold to dry completely before it is snapped into the receiver.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Clean the cannula with a small pipe cleaner&#x2013;like device.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Note that properly caring for the ear device and keeping the ear canal clean and dry can prevent complications.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Checking for Malfunctions</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that inadequate amplification, a whistling noise, or pain from the mold can occur when a hearing aid is not functioning properly.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Check for malfunctions:</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the switch on properly?</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are the batteries charged and positioned correctly?</p>
<p class="Box11BL2Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Is the ear mold clogged with cerumen? Ear wax can be easily removed with pin, pipe cleaner, or wax loop.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Notify the hearing aid dealer if the hearing aid is still not working properly.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep in mind that if the unit requires extended time for repair, the dealer may lend you a hearing aid until the repair can be accomplished.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Recognizing Complications</strong></p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Understand that common medical complications include external otitis media and pressure injury in the external auditory canal. Signs and symptoms of these infections include painful ear, especially when the external ear is touched; canal swelling; redness; difficulty hearing; pain radiating to the jaw area; and fever.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Notify your health care provider for evaluation if any of these symptoms are present. You may need medication to treat infection, pain, or both.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A hearing aid should be fitted according to the patient&#x2019;s needs (e.g., type of hearing loss, manual dexterity, and preference), rather than brand name, by a certified audiologist licensed to dispense hearing aids. Many states have consumer protection laws that allow the hearing aid to be returned after a trial use if the patient is not completely satisfied. In addition, to protect the health and safety of people with hearing loss, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established certain regulations. A medical evaluation of the hearing loss by a physician must be obtained within 6 months before the purchase of a hearing aid. However, the written statement from a physician may be waived if the patient (a fully informed adult 18 years or older) signs a document to this effect. Health care professionals who dispense hearing aids are required to refer prospective users to a physician if any of the following otologic conditions are evident:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Visible congenital or traumatic deformity of the ear</li>
<li>Active drainage from the ear within the previous 90&#x00A0;days</li>
<li>Sudden or rapidly progressive hearing loss within the previous 90 days</li>
<li>Complaints of dizziness or tinnitus</li>
<li>Unilateral hearing loss that has occurred suddenly or within the previous 90 days</li>
<li>Audiometric air&#x2013;bone gap of 15 dB or more at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz</li>
<li>Significant accumulation of cerumen or a foreign body in the external auditory canal</li>
<li>Pain or discomfort in the ear</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">A user instruction brochure is provided with every hearing aid device. In this brochure, the following information is presented:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Notification that good health practice requires a medical evaluation before purchasing a hearing aid</li>
<li>Notification that any of the otologic conditions listed previously should be investigated by a physician before purchase of a hearing aid</li>
<li>Instructions for proper use, maintenance, and care of the hearing aid, as well as instructions for replacing or recharging the batteries</li>
<li>Repair service information</li>
<li>Description of avoidable conditions that could damage the hearing aid</li>
<li>List of any known side effects that may warrant physician consultation (e.g., skin irritation, accelerated cerumen accumulation)</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The evolution in technology has led to the availability of many smaller and more effective devices as well as different options and features of hearing aids (FDA, 2018a) (see Chart&#x00A0;59-13). The majority of hearing aids sold today are behind-the-ear, in-the-ear, or in-the-canal types (see Table&#x00A0;59-4). One model is the Lyric, which is placed in the ear canal just 4 mm from the tympanic membrane. Its volume is controlled by a magnet, and when its batteries no longer function (1 to 4 months), a physician can remove it with the magnet and reinsert a new device. This device does not have many of the problems (e.g., feedback noise, overamplification of background noise) associated with other hearing aids, and it does not involve the expense and uncertainty of surgical procedures. However, Lyric is not an option if the ear canal is too narrow to accommodate the device.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Options and Features of Hearing Aids to Consider</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>T-Coil:</em> May improve hearing on the telephone by switching the settings from normal to telephone setting. This feature also assists in amplifying voices when the patient is in larger areas, such as theaters, auditoriums, and gymnasiums. Background noise may be toned down to adequately hear close conversation.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Directional Microphone:</em> Useful in environments with a lot of background noise and activity. The microphone may be directed toward the speaker and amplifies conversation while diminishing background noise.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Direct Audio Input:</em> Allows direct connection from a remote microphone or an FM assistive listening system to devices such as a computer, television, or stereo.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>Feedback Suppression:</em> Suppresses whistling feedback noise.</p>
