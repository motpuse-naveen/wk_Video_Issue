<p class="nonindent">Many swallowed foreign bodies pass through the GI tract without the need for medical intervention. However, some swallowed foreign bodies (e.g., dentures, fish bones, pins, small batteries, items containing mercury or lead) may injure the esophagus or obstruct its lumen and must be removed. Pain and dysphagia may be present, and dyspnea may occur as a result of pressure on the trachea. The foreign body may be identified by x-ray. Perforation may have occurred (see earlier discussion).</p>

<p class="indent">Glucagon, because of its relaxing effect on the esophageal muscle, may be injected IV (a 1-mg dose). A flexible endoscope and retrieval devices (e.g., forceps, graspers) may be used to remove the impacted food or object from the esophagus. Foreign bodies such as short-blunt objects, long objects, sharp-pointed objects, disc batteries, magnets, coins, or narcotic packets require special consideration (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2873">American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Standards of Practice Committee, 2011</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2892">Fung, Sweetser, Wong Kee Song, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Various devices can be used for endoscopic extraction (overtubes, forceps, snares, baskets, etc.) and dilation techniques can be used to facilitate the passage of foreign objects to the stomach. Decisions regarding the best course of action consider the likelihood of the object passing on its own (blunt, nontoxic objects), the patient&#x2019;s condition (airway maintenance), the length of time the obstruction has been present (typical intervention occurs within 24 hours), and the type of foreign object that is impacted. For example, ingested drug packets are not removed by endoscopy for fear of packet rupture; no intervention or surgical intervention are recommended in these cases. The endoscopic procedure usually is performed in the endoscopy suite or clinic by the gastroenterologist under moderate sedation (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2892">Fung et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
