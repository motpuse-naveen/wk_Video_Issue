<p class="nonindent"><strong>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</strong> can be thought of as a spectrum of disease, progressing from mild to moderate to its most severe, fulminant form. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;acute lung injury:&lt;/b&gt; an umbrella term for hypoxemic respiratory failure; equivalent to mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)">Acute lung injury</button></strong> is a term commonly used to describe mild ARDS. ARDS is a clinical syndrome characterized by a severe inflammatory process causing diffuse alveolar damage that results in sudden and progressive pulmonary edema, increasing bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, hypoxemia unresponsive to oxygen supplementation regardless of the amount of PEEP, and the absence of an elevated left atrial pressure (Siegel, 2019a). Patients often demonstrate reduced lung compliance. A wide range of factors are associated with the development of ARDS (see <a href="#ct19-20">Chart&#x00A0;19-20</a>), including direct injury to the lungs (e.g., smoke inhalation) or indirect insult to the lungs (e.g., shock). ARDS has been associated with a mortality rate ranging from 27% to 50%. Patients who survive the initial cause of ARDS may die later, commonly from HCAP or sepsis (Anesi, 2020; Siegel, 2019a).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Be alert for the development of acute lung injury in the patient population using e-cigarettes, also known as vaping. This syndrome is called e-cigarette or vaping associated acute lung injury (EVALI). According to the CDC (2019c), patients diagnosed with EVALI have been identified in most states.</em></p></div>

<h5 class="h5" id="s687">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Inflammatory triggers initiate the release of cellular and chemical mediators, causing injury to the alveolar capillary membrane in addition to other structural damage to the lungs. Severe V./Q. mismatching occurs. Alveoli collapse because of the inflammatory infiltrate, blood, fluid, and surfactant dysfunction. Small airways are narrowed because of interstitial fluid and bronchial obstruction. Lung compliance may markedly decrease, resulting in decreased functional residual capacity and severe hypoxemia. The blood returning to the lung for gas exchange is pumped through the nonventilated, nonfunctioning areas of the lung, causing shunting. This means that blood is interfacing with nonfunctioning alveoli and gas exchange is markedly impaired, resulting in severe, refractory hypoxemia. <a href="#ff19-9">Figure&#x00A0;19-9</a> shows the sequence of pathophysiologic events leading to ARDS.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s688">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Initially, ARDS closely resembles severe pulmonary edema. The acute phase of ARDS is marked by a rapid onset of severe dyspnea that usually occurs less than 72 hours after <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page572" title="572"></span>the precipitating event. Arterial hypoxemia that does not respond to supplemental oxygen is characteristic. ARDS is classified according to the severity of hypoxemia experienced by the patient as (Siegel, 2019a):</p>

<ul class="bull"><li><span>mild ARDS, with arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>) &#x003E; 200 mm Hg but &#x2264;300 mm Hg,</span></li>

<p class="indent">Findings on chest x-ray are similar to those seen with cardiogenic pulmonary edema and are visible as bilateral infiltrates that quickly worsen. Mild ARDS progresses to fibrosing alveolitis with persistent, severe hypoxemia. The patient also has increased alveolar dead space (ventilation to alveoli but poor perfusion) and typically has decreased pulmonary compliance (&#x201C;stiff lungs,&#x201D; which are difficult to ventilate). Clinically, the patient is thought to be in the recovery phase if the hypoxemia gradually resolves, the chest x-ray improves, and the lungs become more compliant.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s689">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">On physical examination, intercostal retractions and crackles may be present as the fluid begins to leak into the alveolar interstitial space. Common diagnostic tests performed in patients with potential ARDS include plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, echocardiography, and pulmonary artery catheterization. The BNP level is helpful in distinguishing ARDS from cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography may be used if the BNP is not conclusive.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s690">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The primary focus in the management of ARDS includes identification and treatment of the underlying condition. Aggressive, supportive care must be provided to compensate for the severe respiratory dysfunction. This supportive therapy almost always includes ET intubation and mechanical ventilation. In addition, circulatory support, adequate fluid volume, and nutritional support are important. Supplemental oxygen is used as the patient begins the initial spiral of hypoxemia. As the hypoxemia progresses, intubation and mechanical ventilation are instituted. The concentration of oxygen and ventilator settings and modes are determined by the patient&#x2019;s status. This is monitored by arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and bedside pulmonary function testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Providing ventilatory PEEP support is a critical part of the treatment of ARDS. PEEP usually improves oxygenation, but it does not influence the natural history of the syndrome. The use of PEEP helps increase functional residual capacity and reverse alveolar collapse by keeping the alveoli open, resulting in improved arterial oxygenation and a reduction in the severity of the V./Q. imbalance. By using PEEP, a lower FiO<sub>2</sub> may be required. The goal is a PaO<sub>2</sub> greater than 60 mm Hg or an oxygen saturation level of greater than 90% at the lowest possible FiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Systemic hypotension may occur in ARDS as a result of hypovolemia secondary to leakage of fluid into the interstitial spaces and depressed cardiac output from high levels of PEEP therapy. Hypovolemia must be carefully treated without causing further overload. Inotropic or vasopressor agents may be required. Additional supportive treatments may include prone positioning, sedation, paralysis, and nutritional support (Siegel, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There is no specific pharmacologic treatment of ARDS except supportive care. Neuromuscular blocking agents, sedatives, and analgesics may be used to improve patient&#x2013;ventilator synchronization and help to decrease severe hypoxemia (see later discussion in Ventilator Considerations section). Inhaled nitric oxide (an endogenous vasodilator) was thought to reduce V./Q. mismatch and improve oxygenation; however, findings from clinical trials have not shown an improvement in mortality rates between patients who did and did not receive nitric oxide (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Harman, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adequate nutritional support is vital in the treatment of ARDS. Patients with ARDS require 35 to 45 kcal/kg/day to meet caloric requirements. Enteral feeding is the first consideration; however, parenteral nutrition also may be required.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s691">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">General Measures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A patient with ARDS is critically ill and requires close monitoring in an ICU. Respiratory modalities used in this situation include oxygen administration, nebulizer therapy, CPT, ET intubation or tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, suctioning, and bronchoscopy. Frequent assessment of the patient&#x2019;s status is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to supporting the medical plan of care, the nurse considers other needs of the patient. Positioning is important. The nurse turns the patient frequently to improve ventilation and perfusion in the lungs and enhance secretion drainage. However, the nurse must closely monitor the patient for deterioration in oxygenation with changes in position. Oxygenation in patients with ARDS is sometimes improved in the prone position; this seems to be particularly true for patients with COVID-19 and ARDS (see later discussion). This position may be evaluated for improvement in oxygenation and used in special circumstances. Devices and specialty beds are available to assist the nurse in placing the patient in a prone position.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is extremely anxious and agitated because of the increasing hypoxemia and dyspnea. It is important to reduce the patient&#x2019;s anxiety because anxiety increases oxygen expenditure by preventing rest. Rest is essential to limit oxygen consumption and reduce oxygen needs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ventilator Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several considerations must be addressed for the patient intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with PEEP. PEEP, which causes increased end-expiratory pressure, is an unnatural pattern of breathing and feels strange to the patient. The patient may be anxious, and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony may be the consequence. Nursing assessment is important to identify problems with ventilation that may be causing the anxiety reaction: tube blockage by kinking or retained secretions, other acute respiratory problems (e.g., pneumothorax and pain), a sudden decrease in the oxygen level, the level of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page573" title="573"></span>dyspnea, or ventilator malfunction. In some cases, sedation may be required to decrease the patient&#x2019;s oxygen consumption, allow the ventilator to provide full support of ventilation, and decrease the patient&#x2019;s anxiety. Sedatives that may be prescribed are lorazepam, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, propofol, and short-acting barbiturates.</p>
<p class="indent">If the PEEP level cannot be maintained despite the use of sedatives, neuromuscular blocking agents (paralytic agents) may be given to paralyze the patient. Examples of these agents include pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium, and rocuronium. The resulting paralysis allows the patient to be ventilated more easily. With paralysis, the patient appears to be unconscious; loses motor function; and cannot breathe, talk, or blink independently. However, the patient retains sensation and is awake and able to hear. The nurse must reassure the patient that the paralysis is a result of the medication and is temporary. Paralysis should be used for the shortest possible time and never without adequate sedation and pain management.</p>
<p class="indent">Peripheral nerve stimulators are used to assess nerve impulse transmissions at the neuromuscular junction of select skeletal muscles when neuromuscular blocking agents are used. A &#x201C;train-of-four&#x201D; test may be used to measure the level of neuromuscular blockade. With this test, four consecutive stimuli are delivered along the path of a nerve, and the response of the muscle is measured in order to evaluate whether or not stimuli are effectively blocked. Four equal muscle contractions, seen as &#x201C;twitches,&#x201D; will result if there is no neuromuscular blockade. However, if neuromuscular blockade is present, there will be a loss of twitch height and number, which will indicate the degree of blockade. If all four stimulations result in an absence of twitches, it is estimated that 100% of the receptors are blocked (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of neuromuscular blocking agents has many dangers and side effects. The nurse must be sure the patient does not become disconnected from the ventilator, because respiratory muscles are paralyzed and the patient will be apneic. Consequently, the nurse ensures that the patient is closely monitored; all ventilator and patient alarms must be on at all times. Eye care is important as well, because the patient cannot blink, increasing the risk of corneal abrasions. Neuromuscular blockers predispose the patient to venous thromboembolism (VTE), muscle atrophy, foot drop, stress ulcers that may cause hemorrhage, and skin breakdown.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Nursing assessment is essential to minimize the complications related to neuromuscular blockade. The patient may have discomfort or pain but cannot communicate these sensations. In addition, frequent oral care and suctioning may be needed.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Analgesia must be given concurrently with neuromuscular blocking agents (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Saenz, 2019</a>). The nurse must anticipate the patient&#x2019;s needs regarding pain and comfort. The nurse checks the patient&#x2019;s position to ensure it is comfortable without excessive pressure points and in normal alignment. Talking to and not about the patient while in the patient&#x2019;s presence is important.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the nurse must describe the purpose and effects of the neuromuscular blocking agents to the patient&#x2019;s family. If family members are unaware that these agents have been given, they may become distressed by the change in the patient&#x2019;s status.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s692"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most serious complication and most frequent cause of death among patients with COVID-19 is ARDS (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Anesi, 2020</a>). In China, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged, approximately one quarter of patients who were hospitalized in the early days of the pandemic required treatment in critical care units, the majority with respiratory failure and ARDS. Of these, 52.4% died secondary to complications of ARDS (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1524">Niederman, Richeldi, Chotirmall, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Wu &#x0026; McGoogan, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The pathogenesis of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia appears to have some differences from other cases of ARDS. In particular, although there is evidence of damage to epithelial cells within alveoli, epithelial cells within the pulmonary endothelium are not damaged, resulting in less exudative pathologic changes than with other types of ARDS. In terms of clinical manifestations, some patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia do not voice complaints of dyspnea but nonetheless may deteriorate rapidly into respiratory failure. Furthermore, some patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who are mechanically ventilated do not exhibit the poor lung compliance that is a classic manifestation of typical ARDS. In addition, the onset of most non-COVID-19 cases of ARDS is typically one week or less from the time of the causative insult; however, the median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to ARDS is longer, at between 8 to 12 days (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Li &#x0026; Ma, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The same classification system used to diagnosis other cases of ARDS is used to classify patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS (i.e., as having mild, moderate, or severe ARDS) (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Cascella et al., 2020</a>). Many of the same strategies used to manage patients without COVID-19 who have ARDS apply to the patient with COVID-19 and ARDS. For instance, it is recommended that the patient with COVID-19 and ARDS who is mechanically ventilated receive low tidal volumes (i.e., 4 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight). However, there are some specific differences in the recommended treatment of the adult with COVID-19 and ARDS who is mechanically ventilated, which include the following (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1449">Alhazzani, Moller, Arabi, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Anesi, 2020</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>PEEP &#x003E; 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O should be delivered (although the patient should be closely monitored for barotrauma if the PEEP is &#x003E;10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O);</span></li>
<li><span>Low dosages of intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) may be prescribed;</span></li>
<li><span>Nitric oxide should not be routinely prescribed; however, for patients with severe ARDS refractory to other treatments, nitric oxide might be tried;</span></li>
<li><span>For the patient with moderate or severe ARDS, prone positioning for 12 to 16 hours daily is recommended, if feasible; and</span></li>
<li><span>For the patient with moderate or severe ARDS, intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents are preferred over continuous infusions, unless there is persistent patient-ventilator dyssynchrony.</span></li></ul>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 573</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page574" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="574">p. 574</span></div>
<p class="indent">Other treatments recommended for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia should also be followed (see previous discussion on COVID-19 pneumonia).</p>
<p class="indent">It has been reported that more patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who are mechanically ventilated have neurologic impairment (e.g., delirium, encephalopathy) than other patients with ARDS who are mechanically ventilated. Therefore, sedative requirements for these patients are reportedly higher than for most other patients with ARDS (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Anesi, 2020</a>). These neurologic manifestations are that much more difficult to manage because family members and friends, who may be a source of solace to the patient who is agitated, are typically not permitted to visit. Furthermore, the nurse caring for these patients must also practice isolation precautions and minimize interactions with the patient, which can serve to make the patient feel more isolated and agitated.</p>
