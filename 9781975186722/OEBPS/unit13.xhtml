<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps">Y</span>ou are a nurse working in an outpatient dermatology clinic. A 22-year-old White woman with a family history of melanoma presents to the clinic with three moles that look atypical. She undergoes excision and biopsy of the moles. One week later she returns to the clinic for her results. Two of the moles are within normal limits; however, one mole on her right shoulder is positive for melanoma <em>in situ</em>. The dermatologist recommends a total excision of the area with 2.5 cm (1 in) margins. As the patient is leaving the clinic, she asks you if this is the best treatment option and what she can do to prevent further skin cancers. What is the evidence base for managing melanoma <em>in situ?</em> What evidence-based recommendations will you make to help her prevent further skin cancers?</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
