<h4 class="h4" id="s793">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A wide range of diagnostic studies may be performed in patients with cardiovascular conditions. The nurse should educate the patient on the purpose, what to expect, and any possible side effects related to these examinations prior to testing. The nurse should note trends in results because they provide information about disease progression as well as the patient&#x2019;s response to therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s794">Laboratory Tests</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Samples of the patient&#x2019;s blood are sent to the laboratory for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>To screen for risk factors associated with CAD</span></li>
<li><span>To establish baseline values before initiating other diagnostic tests, procedures, or therapeutic interventions</span></li>
<li><span>To monitor response to therapeutic interventions</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>To assess for abnormalities in the blood that affect prognosis</p>
<p class="indent">Normal values for laboratory tests may vary depending on the laboratory and the health care institution. This variation is due to the differences in equipment and methods of measurement across organizations.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiac Biomarker Analysis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of MI is made by evaluating the history and physical examination, the 12-lead ECG, and the results of laboratory tests that measure serum cardiac biomarkers. Myocardial cells that become necrotic from prolonged ischemia or trauma release specific enzymes (creatine kinase [CK]), CK isoenzymes (CK-MB), and proteins (myoglobin, troponin T, and troponin I). These substances leak into the interstitial spaces of the myocardium and are carried by the lymphatic system into general circulation. As a result, abnormally high levels of these substances can be detected in serum blood samples. (See <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for further discussion of cardiac biomarker analysis.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Blood Chemistry, Hematology, and Coagulation&#x00A0;Studies</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><a href="#tt21-4">Table&#x00A0;21-4</a> provides information about some common serum laboratory tests and the implications for patients with CVD. Discussion of lipid, brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine measurements follows.</p>
<p class="h7">Lipid Profile</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoproteins are measured to evaluate a person&#x2019;s risk of developing CAD, especially if there is a family history of premature heart disease, or to diagnose a specific lipoprotein abnormality. Cholesterol and triglycerides are transported in the blood by combining with plasma proteins to form lipoproteins called LDL and HDL. Although cholesterol levels remain relatively constant over 24 hours, the blood specimen for the lipid profile should be obtained after a 12-hour fast.</p>
<p class="h8">Cholesterol Levels</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cholesterol is a lipid required for hormone synthesis and cell membrane formation. It is found in large quantities in brain and nerve tissue. Two major sources of cholesterol are diet (animal products) and the liver, where cholesterol is synthesized. Factors that contribute to variations in cholesterol levels include age, gender, diet, exercise patterns, genetics, menopause, tobacco use, and stress levels. Total cholesterol level is calculated by adding the HDL, LDL, and 20% of the triglyceride level.</p>
<p class="indent">High cholesterol levels increase the risk of CVD regardless of the patient&#x2019;s age. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower cholesterol levels. After determining a person&#x2019;s 10-year risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease, medication is prescribed if necessary. Statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering medications, are often prescribed. Other nonstatins may be added to medication management to further reduce cholesterol; these include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and PCSK9 inhibitors (<a href="#bib1653">Grundy, Stone, Bailey, et al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> for more details).</p>

<p class="indent">LDL is the primary transporter of cholesterol and triglycerides into the cell. One harmful effect of LDL is the deposition of these substances in the walls of arterial vessels. HDL has a protective action because it transports cholesterol away from the tissue and cells of the arterial wall to the liver for excretion (<a href="#bib1690">Grundy et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Triglycerides</p>
<p class="nonindent">Triglycerides, composed of free fatty acids and glycerol, are stored in the adipose tissue and are a source of energy. Triglyceride levels increase after meals and are affected by stress. Diabetes, alcohol use, and obesity can elevate triglyceride levels. These levels have a direct correlation with LDL and an inverse one with HDL.</p>
<p class="h7">Brain (B-Type) Natriuretic Peptide</p>
<p class="nonindent">BNP is a neurohormone that helps regulate BP and fluid volume. It is primarily secreted from the ventricles in response to increased preload with resulting elevated ventricular pressure. The level of BNP in the blood increases as the ventricular walls expand from increased pressure, making it a helpful diagnostic, monitoring, and prognostic tool in the setting of HF. Because this serum laboratory test can be quickly obtained, BNP levels are useful for prompt diagnosis of HF in settings such as the ED. Elevations in BNP can occur from a number of other conditions such as pulmonary embolus, MI, and ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, the primary provider correlates BNP levels with abnormal physical assessment findings and other diagnostic tests before making a definitive diagnosis of HF. A BNP level greater than 100 pg/mL is suggestive of HF.</p>
<p class="h7">C-Reactive Protein</p>
<p class="nonindent">CRP is a protein produced by the liver in response to systemic inflammation. Inflammation is thought to play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) test is used as an adjunct to other tests to predict CVD risk. People with high hs-CRP levels (3 mg/L or greater) may be at greatest risk for CVD compared to people with moderate (1 to 3 mg/L) or low (less than 1 mg/L) hs-CRP levels (<a href="#bib1690">Sidawy &#x0026; Perler, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Homocysteine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Homocysteine, an amino acid, is linked to the development of atherosclerosis because it can damage the endothelial lining of arteries and promote thrombus formation. Therefore, an elevated blood level of homocysteine is thought to indicate a high risk for CAD, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, although it is not an independent predictor of CAD. Genetic factors and a diet low in folate, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are associated with elevated homocysteine levels. A 12-hour fast is necessary before drawing a blood sample for an accurate serum measurement. Test results are interpreted as optimal (less than 12 mcmol/L), borderline (12 to 15 mcmol/L), and high risk (greater than 15 mcmol/L) (<a href="#bib1690">Zipes et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s795">Chest X-Ray and Fluoroscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A chest x-ray is obtained to determine the size, contour, and position of the heart. It reveals cardiac and pericardial calcifications and demonstrates physiologic alterations in the pulmonary circulation. Although it does not help diagnose acute MI, it can help diagnose some complications (e.g., HF). Correct placement of pacemakers and pulmonary artery catheters is also confirmed by chest x-ray.</p>
<p class="indent">Fluoroscopy is an x-ray imaging technique that allows visualization of the heart on a screen. It shows cardiac and vascular pulsations and unusual cardiac contours. This technique uses a movable x-ray source, which makes it a useful aid for positioning transvenous pacing electrodes and for guiding the insertion of arterial and venous catheters during cardiac catheterization and other cardiac procedures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s796">Electrocardiography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The ECG is a graphic representation of the electrical currents of the heart. The ECG is obtained by placing disposable electrodes in standard positions on the skin of the chest wall and extremities. Recordings of the electrical current flowing between two electrodes are made on graph paper or displayed on a monitor. Several different recordings can be obtained by using a variety of electrode combinations, called <em>leads.</em> Simply stated, a lead is a specific view of the electrical activity of heart. The standard ECG is composed of 12 leads or 12 different views, although it is possible to record 15 or 18 leads.</p>
<p class="indent">The 12-lead ECG is used to diagnose arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and chamber enlargement, as well as myocardial ischemia, injury, or infarction. It can also suggest cardiac effects of electrolyte disturbances (high or low calcium and potassium levels) and the effects of antiarrhythmic medications. A 15-lead ECG adds three additional chest leads across the right precordium and is used for early diagnosis of right ventricular and left posterior (ventricular) infarction. The 18-lead ECG adds three posterior leads to the 15-lead ECG and is useful for early detection of myocardial ischemia and injury. To enhance interpretation of the ECG, the patient&#x2019;s age, gender, BP, height, weight, symptoms, and medications (especially digitalis and antiarrhythmic agents) are noted on the ECG requisition. (See <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> for a more detailed discussion of ECG.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuous Electrocardiographic Monitoring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Continuous ECG monitoring is the standard of care for patients who are at high risk for arrhythmias. This form of cardiac monitoring detects abnormalities in heart rate and rhythm. Many systems have the capacity to monitor for changes in ST segments, which are used to identify the presence of myocardial ischemia or injury (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). Two types of continuous ECG monitoring techniques are used in health care settings: hardwire cardiac monitoring, found in EDs, critical care units, and progressive care units; and telemetry, found in general nursing care units or outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs. Hardwire cardiac monitoring and telemetry systems vary in sophistication; however, most systems have the following features in common:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Monitor more than one ECG lead simultaneously.</span></li>
<li><span>Monitor ST segments (ST-segment depression is a marker of myocardial ischemia; ST-segment elevation provides evidence of an evolving MI).</span></li>
<li><span>Provide graded visual and audible alarms (based on priority, asystole merits the highest grade of alarm).</span></li>
<li><span>Interpret and store alarms.</span></li></ul>

<ul class="bull"><li><span>Print a copy of rhythms from one or more specific ECG leads over a set time (called a <em>rhythm strip</em>).</span></li></ul>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients placed on continuous ECG monitoring must be informed of its purpose and cautioned that it does not detect shortness of breath, chest pain, or other ACS symptoms. Thus, patients are instructed to report new or worsening symptoms immediately.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7"><strong><img class="m" src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/></strong> Hardwire Cardiac Monitoring</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hardwire cardiac monitoring is used to continuously observe the heart for arrhythmias and conduction disorders using one or two ECG leads. A real-time ECG is displayed on a bedside monitor and at a central monitoring station. In critical care units, additional components can be added to the bedside monitor to continuously monitor hemodynamic parameters (noninvasive BP, arterial pressures, pulmonary artery pressures), respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), and ST segments for myocardial ischemia. The nurse must know the specific indication for each patient&#x2019;s ECG monitoring.</p>
<p class="h7">Telemetry</p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to hardwire cardiac monitoring, the ECG can be continuously observed by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;telemetry:&lt;/b&gt; the process of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring by the transmission of radio waves from a battery-operated transmitter worn by the patient">telemetry</button></strong>&#x2014;the transmission of radio waves from a battery-operated transmitter to a central bank of monitors. The primary benefit of using telemetry is that the system is wireless, which allows patients to ambulate while one or two ECG leads are monitored. The patient has electrodes placed on the chest with a lead cable that connects to the transmitter. The transmitter can be placed in a disposable pouch and worn around the neck, or simply secured to the patient&#x2019;s clothing. Most transmitter batteries are changed every 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p class="h7">Lead Systems</p>
<p class="nonindent">The number of electrodes needed for hardwire cardiac monitoring and telemetry is dictated by the lead system used in the clinical setting. Electrodes need to be securely and correctly placed on the chest wall to accurately capture arrhythmias (<a href="#bib1676">Sandau, Funk, Auerbach, et al., 2017</a>). <a href="#ct21-5">Chart&#x00A0;21-5</a> provides helpful hints on how to apply these electrodes. There are three-, four-, or five-lead systems available for ECG monitoring. The type of lead system used determines the number of lead options for monitoring. For example, the five-lead system provides up to seven different lead selections. Unlike the other two systems, the five-lead system can monitor the activity of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. <a href="#ff21-9">Figure&#x00A0;21-9</a> presents diagrams of electrode placement.</p>
<p class="indent">The two ECG leads most often selected for continuous ECG monitoring are leads II and V<sub>1</sub>. Lead II provides the best visualization of atrial depolarization (represented by the P wave). Lead V<sub>1</sub> best records ventricular depolarization and is most helpful when monitoring for certain arrhythmias (e.g., premature ventricular contractions, tachycardias, bundle branch blocks) (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>). In addition to proper lead and electrode placement, it is important for the nurse to review and customize alarm settings for each patient to reduce false alarms and alarm fatigue (<a href="#bib1657">Jepsen, Sendelbach, Ruppel, et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Applying Electrodes</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The monitoring system requires an adequate electrical signal to analyze the patient&#x2019;s cardiac rhythm. Proper use of this technology includes the correct application of electrodes to reduce false alarms on the cardiac monitor. When applying electrodes, the recommendations below should be followed to optimize skin adherence and conduction of the heart&#x2019;s electrical current:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>D&#x00E9;bride the skin surface of dead cells with soap and water; dry well using a wash cloth or gauze.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Clip (do not shave) hair from around the electrode site, if needed.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Connect the electrodes to the lead wires prior to placing them on the chest (connecting lead wires when electrodes are in place may be uncomfortable for some patients).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Peel the backing off the electrode, and check to make sure the center is moist with electrode gel.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Locate the appropriate lead placement, and apply the electrode to the skin, securing it in place with light pressure.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Change the electrodes every 24 hours, examine the skin for irritation, and apply the electrodes to different locations.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If the patient is sensitive to the electrodes, use hypoallergenic electrodes.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Ambulatory Electrocardiography</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ambulatory electrocardiography is a form of continuous or intermittent ECG home monitoring. It is used for longer-term monitoring, since some arrhythmias occur intermittently and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page676" title="676"></span>are difficult to capture with a 12-lead ECG in the office setting. This monitoring can help to identify the etiology of chest pain, syncope or palpitation caused by arrhythmias, detect episodes of myocardial ischemia, evaluate effectiveness of treatment of HF and arrhythmias, and evaluate the functioning of ICDs and pacemakers. Several types of devices are available and are worn either externally or implanted under the skin. The ECG is transmitted to a centralized monitoring station via telephone or wireless technology to a secure Web site (<a href="#bib1690">Sampson, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Continuous Monitors</p>
<p class="nonindent">Commonly called Holter monitors, these small portable recorders are connected to chest electrodes (number varies based on model used) that record all ECG activity using two or more leads onto a digital memory device. The patient usually wears the recorder for 24 to 48 hours. The patient is also asked to keep a diary to note the date and time of symptoms and activities. The diary is used by the primary provider to correlate symptoms with detected arrhythmias. Once monitoring is completed, the patient returns the device and diary to the primary provider&#x2019;s office. Data from the digital memory device are then uploaded into a computer for analysis, and rhythms that need further evaluation by the primary provider are identified. Therefore, Holter monitors do not provide real-time ECG recordings or analysis. The effectiveness of this form of monitoring is dependent upon the patient&#x2019;s adherence with wearing the monitor, keeping an accurate diary, and if an arrhythmia occurred during the monitoring period (<a href="#bib1690">Sampson, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib1690">Urden et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A novel alternative to the use of the Holter monitor is ECG patch monitoring, which uses Bluetooth technology. An ECG patch with adhesive backing is placed over the left pectoral area, eliminating the need for multiple ECG electrodes, wires, and recorders. The patch is single use, waterproof, and easily concealed under clothing. The patient wears the patch for 7 to 14 days and then returns it to the manufacturer for analysis. This device can detect more arrhythmias compared to the Holter monitor since it is worn by the patient for a longer period of time (<a href="#bib1690">Sampson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Intermittent Monitors</p>
<p class="nonindent">Intermittent cardiac event monitors are devices that can capture arrhythmias when the patient experiences symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Patients may need to record events for several days to a month. The recorded ECGs are transmitted to the primary provider by telephone or a wireless transmission. The symptom event monitor and external loop recorder are two common forms of external intermittent cardiac event monitors.</p>
<p class="indent">The symptom event monitor is used to record and store the ECG during only during times when the patient is experiencing symptoms. Patients activate the symptom event monitor by pressing a button for devices that are worn on the wrist or by placing a small handheld device over the chest.</p>
<p class="indent">The loop recorder, a small battery-operated device, can record and store short periods of ECG activity. The monitor is inserted under the skin or worn on a wrist band. Some loop recorders are programmed to detect bradycardia, tachycardia, and irregular rhythms and do not require patient interaction. Other loop recorders require the patient to activate ECG recordings by pushing a button. The device records the patient&#x2019;s ECG for a predetermined time before and after the device activation. This is a preferred method over the symptom event monitor because it has more monitoring capabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Real-time smart phone monitoring is a novel approach to cardiac event recording. The KardiaMobile<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> is a small device that connects to a smart phone app. The patient places two fingers on the device which generates a PDF file that can be sent electronically to the provider. Similarly, a patient can place a finger on the digital section of the Apple watch<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> to generate a rhythm strip. This rhythm is displayed on the watch face and a PDF file is sent to an app on the Apple iPhone<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (<a href="#bib1690">Sampson, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac implantable electronic devices include pacemakers and ICDs. These lifesaving devices are used to manage patients with serious cardiac illnesses. The technology available today allows for remote wireless monitoring of these devices to determine battery life, pacing parameters and therapies, and occurrence of serious atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. A transmitter, which is placed in the patient&#x2019;s home, sends device data to a secure data repository on a secure Web portal. A unique feature of these implantable devices is that they have programmable alerts that automatically detect and transmit arrhythmias without the need for patient interaction (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">An implantable cardiac monitor such as the Reveal LINQ<sup>&#x2122;</sup> is another type of electronic device. This small device is implanted subcutaneously under the skin and has a battery life of 3 years. Recordings are triggered when an arrhythmia is detected by the device. Recordings are sent wirelessly via a home monitoring device for expert evaluation. Compared with event recorders described previously, this device offers advantages such as eliminating the patient&#x2019;s need to change electrodes and wear or carry the monitoring device. This type of monitoring is recommended for patients who have infrequent symptoms or require longer-term ECG monitoring (<a href="#bib1690">Sampson, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions for Inpatient Cardiac&#x00A0;Monitoring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A body of evidence indicates that most alarms occurring during inpatient ECG monitoring are false alarms. Nurses dealing with excessive alarms become desensitized to these sounds and develop alarm fatigue. Alarm fatigue delays response time or results in missed alarms. Several nursing interventions facilitate acquisition of accurate data, reduce risk of alarm fatigue, and ensure patient safety when using cardiac monitoring (<a href="#bib1690">Jepsen et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1690">Sandau et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To minimize false alarms, the ECG recordings must be free of artifact, which is an abnormal ECG pattern caused by muscular activity, patient movement, electrical interference, or lead cable or electrode malfunction. Artifact can mimic arrhythmias and cause unnecessary false alarms. Key to the elimination of artifact is using proper skin preparation before applying electrodes and changing the electrodes every 24 hours. During electrode changes, the skin should be assessed for allergic responses (itchy, reddened skin) to the adhesive or electrode gel. If present, the electrodes are replaced with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page677" title="677"></span>hypoallergenic electrodes. Rotation of electrode placement on the skin will reduce the risk for skin breakdown (see <a href="#ff21-9">Fig.&#x00A0;21-9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Electrodes and lead connections need to be positioned correctly. Improper positioning can result in artifact that mimics ischemia or arrhythmias. Two leads should be selected that provide the best tracing for arrhythmia monitoring, which are usually lead II and the chest lead V<sub>1</sub>. Electrical equipment in use around the patient should be inspected to be certain that it is functioning properly and has been recently checked by the medical engineering department per organization policy, because improperly functioning equipment may cause false alarms from artifact.</p>
<p class="indent">An effort should be made to individualize the ECG alarm parameters to meet the patient&#x2019;s monitoring needs. For example, if the patient has atrial fibrillation, it is appropriate to turn off the irregular heart rate alarm. Keeping it on will create unnecessary alarms, contributing to alarm fatigue. Similarly, the bradycardia and tachycardia alarms should be adjusted, slightly below or above the patient&#x2019;s underlying heart rate (<a href="#bib1690">Jepsen et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib1690">Sandau et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse&#x2019;s role is to respond to and correct all monitor alarms immediately. Inoperative (inop) monitoring alarms&#x2014;used to communicate that electrodes have fallen off, that leads are loose, or that the system&#x2019;s battery power is low (e.g., telemetry)&#x2014;are just as significant as arrhythmia alarms indicating that the patient is tachycardic, bradycardic, or experiencing another potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Timely responses to all alarms can prevent serious consequences, including death.</p>
<p class="indent">Hospital-acquired infections can be transmitted through lead wire cables. This may be prevented by using disposable lead wire cables, or by keeping reusable cables and transmitter equipment clean, per organizational policy. A patient should never be connected to monitoring equipment that has not been thoroughly cleaned between patients. If a patient is scheduled for a device implant, such as a pacemaker, electrodes should not be placed over the planned incision site. Likewise, electrodes should never be placed over an incision, implanted device, open wounds, or inflamed skin.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrodes should be removed once monitoring is discontinued and skin cleansed to remove excess electrode gel and adhesive. Metal-containing electrodes must be removed before sending a patient for any magnetic resonance scan, including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).</p>
<p class="indent">Telemetry transmitters and other monitoring equipment should be maintained according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. Monitoring devices of any type should not be submerged in water. A monitoring device may break if dropped; therefore, it should be secured to the patient&#x2019;s gown or clothing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s797">Cardiac Stress Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Normally, the coronary arteries dilate to four times their usual diameter in response to increased metabolic demands for oxygen and nutrients. However, coronary arteries affected by atherosclerosis dilate less, compromising blood flow to the myocardium and causing ischemia. Therefore, abnormalities in cardiovascular function are more likely to be detected during times of increased oxygen demand, or &#x201C;stress.&#x201D; The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardiac stress test:&lt;/b&gt; a test used to evaluate the functioning of the heart during a period of increased oxygen demand; test may be initiated by exercise or medications">cardiac stress test</button></strong> procedures&#x2014;the exercise stress test, pharmacologic stress test, and radionucleotide imaging studies&#x2014;are noninvasive ways to evaluate if there is myocardial ischemia and higher myocardial oxygen requirement during these tests. Cardiac imaging is performed during the resting state and immediately after stress testing. The results can identify specific coronary artery lesions and ischemic areas of the heart (<a href="#bib1690">King, 2017</a>). Since complications of stress testing can be life-threatening (MI, cardiac arrest, HF, and bradycardia and tachycardia with hemodynamic compromise), testing facilities must have staff and equipment ready to provide treatment, including advanced cardiac life support.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Exercise Stress Testing</h6>
<p class="h7a">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">During an exercise stress test, the patient walks or runs on a treadmill (most common) or pedals a stationary bicycle. A protocol guides exercise intensity based upon the patient&#x2019;s age and heart rate goal (<a href="#bib1690">King, 2017</a>). During the test, the following are monitored: two or more ECG leads for heart rate, rhythm, and ischemic changes; BP; skin temperature; physical appearance; perceived exertion; and symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, leg cramping, and fatigue. The test is stopped when the target heart rate is achieved or if the patient experiences signs of myocardial ischemia. Abnormal findings include chest pain, ventricular arrhythmia, ST-segment depression, and lack of heart rate or BP elevation with exercise (<a href="#bib1690">King, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">In preparation for the exercise stress test, the patient is instructed to fast for several hours before the test and to avoid stimulants such as tobacco and caffeine. Medications may be taken with sips of water. The primary provider may instruct the patient to hold beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis for up to 48 hours before the stress test. Clothes and sneakers or rubber-soled shoes suitable for exercising are to be worn. The nurse prepares the patient for the stress test by describing how the stress test is performed, the type of monitoring equipment used, the rationale for insertion of an IV catheter, and what symptoms to report. The exercise method is reviewed, and patients are asked to put forth their best exercise effort. If the test is to be performed with echocardiography or radionuclide imaging (described in the next section), this information is reviewed as well. After the test, the patient is monitored for 10 to 15 minutes until vital signs and assessment findings return to normal. Once stable, patients may resume their usual activities.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Stress Testing</h6>
<p class="h7a">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who are cognitively impaired and unable to follow directions or physically disabled or deconditioned will not be able to achieve their target heart rate by exercising on a treadmill or bicycle. Vasodilating agents such as dipyridamole, adenosine, or regadenoson given as an IV infusion are used to mimic the effects of exercise by maximally dilating normal coronary arteries and identifying stenotic arteries that cannot vasodilate. The side effects of these agents are related to the vasodilating action and include chest pain, headache, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page678" title="678"></span>flushing, nausea, heart block, and dyspnea. If necessary the effects of these drugs can be reversed with IV aminophylline. Adenosine has an extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), so any severe effects subside rapidly. These vasodilating medications are the agents used in conjunction with radionuclide imaging techniques. Patients undergoing pharmacologic stress tests must avoid xanthine derivatives including theophylline, aminophylline, and caffeine as they block the effects of the vasodilating agents.</p>
<p class="indent">Dobutamine is another option for use during a pharmacologic stress test. This medication is a synthetic sympathomimetic agent that increases heart rate, myocardial contractility, and BP, thereby increasing the metabolic demands of the heart. It is the agent of choice when echocardiography is used because of its effects on altering myocardial wall motion (due to enhanced contractility). Dobutamine is also used for patients who have bronchospasm or pulmonary disease and cannot tolerate having doses of theophylline withheld.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">In preparation for the pharmacologic stress test, the patient is instructed not to eat or drink anything for at least 3 hours before the test. The patient must also be told to refrain from eating any liquid or food that contain chocolate or caffeine for 24 hours and to avoid taking medications that contain caffeine. This restriction also includes caffeine-free coffee, tea, and carbonated beverages. If caffeine is ingested before a stress test using vasodilating agents, the test will have to be rescheduled. Patients taking aminophylline, theophylline, or dipyridamole are instructed to stop taking these medications for 24 to 48 hours before the test (if tolerated). The patient is informed about the transient sensations that may occur during infusion of the vasodilating agent, such as flushing or nausea, which will disappear quickly. The patient is instructed to report the occurrence of any other symptoms during the test to the cardiologist or nurse. The stress test may take about 1 hour, or up to 3 hours if imaging is performed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s798">Radionuclide Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Radionuclide imaging studies are noninvasive tests that use radioisotopes to evaluate coronary artery perfusion, detect myocardial ischemia and infarction, and/or assess left ventricular function. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;radioisotopes:&lt;/b&gt; unstable atoms that give off small amounts of energy in the form of gamma rays as they decay; used in cardiac nuclear medicine studies">Radioisotopes</button></strong> are unstable atoms that give off small amounts of energy in the form of gamma rays as they decay. When radioisotopes are injected into the bloodstream, the energy emitted can be detected by a gamma scintillation camera positioned over the body. These radioisotopes are called tracers.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Myocardial Perfusion Imaging</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Myocardial perfusion imaging is performed using two types of techniques: single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). It is commonly performed after an acute MI to determine if arterial perfusion to the heart is compromised during activity and to evaluate the extent of myocardial damage. It is also used to evaluate if myocardial ischemia from CAD is the cause of chest pain or other CAD-related symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">These imaging techniques are performed in combination with stress testing to compare images obtained when the heart is resting to images of the heart in a stressed state resulting from exercise or medications. An area of the myocardium that shows no perfusion or reduced perfusion is said to have a &#x201C;defect&#x201D; present. Comparing resting images with images taken after the stress test helps differentiate ischemic myocardium from infarct-related myocardium. A defect that does not change in size before and after stress is called a fixed defect. Fixed defects indicate that there is no perfusion in that area of the myocardium, which is the case after an MI. Defects that appear or that get larger after the stress test images are taken indicate reduced perfusion to that area of the heart. Because the defect disappears with rest, it is called a reversible defect. Reversible defects constitute positive stress test findings. Typically, cardiac catheterization is recommended after a positive test result to determine the severity of obstructions to blood flow caused by CAD.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging with stress testing should be prepared for the type of stressor to be used (exercise or medication) and provided with details of what to expect during imaging. The imaging is performed in two stages. Usually, the resting images are taken first. An IV is inserted to administer the radioisotope, and electrodes are placed on the chest to monitor the heart rate and rhythm. Women who are nursing, pregnant or think they are pregnant should not undergo myocardial perfusion imaging. The nurse alerts the primary provider if any of these conditions are present.</p>
<p class="h7">Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography</p>
<p class="nonindent">SPECT is widely available and is the most common technique of myocardial perfusion imaging. In addition, the ability of SPECT to detect myocardial ischemia is between 80% and 90% (<a href="#bib1690">King, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">SPECT is a painless, noninvasive procedure that involves the injection of the nuclear medicine radionucleotide (technetium-99m [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]; rubidium-82) and imaging. During SPECT, patients are positioned supine on the table with their arms over their heads. The gamma camera circles around the chest area converting the signals from the traces into pictures of the heart. The procedure takes approximately 30 minutes. The second scan is repeated after an exercise or pharmacologic stress test.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse&#x2019;s primary role is to prepare the patient for SPECT and insert an IV catheter or assess an existing IV for patency and suitability. The IV is used to inject the tracer. The patient may be concerned about receiving a radioactive substance and needs to be reassured that these tracers are safe&#x2014;the radiation exposure is similar to that of other diagnostic x-ray studies. No postprocedure radiation precautions are necessary.</p>
<p class="h7">Positron Emission Tomography</p>
<p class="nonindent">PET is another noninvasive procedure in which a radioactive tracer chemical is administered to the patient and images are obtained. These images generally have a higher resolution compared to SPECT. PET technology is expensive and is likely to be found at large or academic medical centers.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 678</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page679" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="679">p. 679</span></div>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">During PET, tracers are given by injection; one compound is used to determine blood flow in the myocardium, and another determines the metabolic function. The PET camera provides detailed three-dimensional images of the distributed compounds. The viability of the myocardium is determined by comparing the extent of glucose metabolism in the myocardium to the degree of blood flow. For example, ischemic but viable tissue will show decreased blood flow and elevated metabolism. For a patient with this finding, revascularization through surgery or angioplasty will probably be indicated to improve heart function. Restrictions of food intake before the test vary among institutions, but because PET evaluates glucose metabolism, the patient&#x2019;s blood glucose level should be within the normal range before testing.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse instructs the patient to refrain from using alcohol and caffeine for 24 hours before undergoing PET because of the stimulating effects they may have on the heart. For patients with diabetes and who are taking insulin, the nurse needs to discuss insulin doses and food restrictions with the primary provider. The nurse assesses patients for fear of closed spaces or claustrophobia. Patients who have this condition are reassured that medications can be given to help them relax. The nurse also reassures patients that radiation exposure is at safe and acceptable levels, similar to those of other diagnostic x-ray studies.</p>
<p class="indent">To prepare the patient for PET, the nurse inserts an IV or assesses the existing IV catheter for patency and suitability, and then describes the procedure to the patient. The patient is positioned on a table with hands above the head. The table then slides into a donut-shaped scanner. While in the scanner, the patient must lie still so that clear images of the heart can be obtained. A baseline scan is performed, which takes about 30 minutes. Then a tracer is injected into the IV and the scan is repeated. The patient&#x2019;s glucose level is monitored throughout the procedure. The scan takes from 1 to 3 hours to complete.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Test of Ventricular Function and Wall Motion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA), also known as multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning, is a common noninvasive technique that uses a conventional scintillation camera interfaced with a computer to record images of the heart during several hundred heartbeats. The computer processes the data and allows for sequential viewing of the functioning heart. The sequential images are analyzed to evaluate left ventricular function, wall motion, and ejection fraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is reassured that there is no known radiation danger and is instructed to remain motionless during the scan.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s799">Additional Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Additional cardiac imaging techniques include computed tomography (CT) and MRA.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Computed Tomography</h6>
<p class="h7a">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac CT scanning is a form of cardiac imaging that uses x-rays to provide accurate cross-sectional &#x201C;virtual&#x201D; slices of specific areas of the heart and surrounding structures. Complex mathematical and computer algorithms are used to analyze the slices to create three-dimensional images. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is a fast form of CT scanning that takes multiple slices at the same time. This technology produces high-resolution clear images of cardiac anatomy (<a href="#bib1666">Liddy, Buckley, Kok, et al., 2018</a>). Two types of cardiac CT scanning include coronary CT angiography and electron beam CT (EBCT) (for coronary calcium scoring).</p>
<p class="indent">Coronary CT angiography requires the use of an IV contrast agent to enhance the x-rays and improve visualization of cardiac structures. This test is used to evaluate coronary arteries for stenosis, the aorta for aneurysms or dissections, graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting, pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation, and cardiac structures for congenital anomalies. Patients may receive beta-blockers prior to the scan to control heart rate and rhythm and reduce artifact. Another way to minimize artifact is to have patients hold their breath periodically throughout the scan. Coronary CT angiography is used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. The contrast agent used during the CT scan is excreted through the kidneys; therefore, renal function should be assessed prior to the scan. It may be necessary to administer IV hydration before and after the scan to minimize the effect of the contrast on renal function. Patients will require premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines if they experienced a reaction to a contrast agent in the past (<a href="#bib1669">Mervak, Cohan, Ellis, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">EBCT is used to calculate a coronary artery calcium score that is based on the amount of calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. This score is used to predict the likelihood of cardiac events, such as MI, or the need for a revascularization procedure in the future. Coronary artery calcium scoring is used for the evaluation of individuals without known CAD and offers limited incremental prognostic value for individuals with known CAD, such as those with stents and bypass grafts. Currently, EBCT is thought to be a reasonable test to consider in patients with low to intermediate risk for future CAD-related events. Results of the test may help to reclassify them to higher risk and thus intensify primary prevention measures (<a href="#bib1690">Arnett et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse provides details of the procedure to help prepare the patient for the test. Patients need to be prepared to hold their breath at certain times during the procedure, so it is important for the nurse to practice with the patient before going for CT scan. The patient is positioned on a table, and the scanner rotates around the table during the test. The procedure is noninvasive and painless. However, to obtain adequate images, the patient must lie completely still during the scanning process. An IV is necessary if contrast is to be used to enhance the images. The patient should be told to expect transient flushing, metallic taste, nausea, or bradycardia during the contrast infusion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Magnetic Resonance Angiography</h6>
<p class="h7a">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">MRA is a noninvasive, painless technique that is used to examine both the physiologic and anatomic properties of the heart. MRA uses a powerful magnetic field and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page680" title="680"></span>computer-generated pictures to image the heart and great vessels. It is valuable in diagnosing diseases of the aorta, heart muscle, and pericardium, as well as congenital heart lesions. The application of this technique to the evaluation of coronary artery anatomy is limited because the quality of the images is distorted by respirations, the beating heart, and certain implanted devices (stents and surgical clips). In addition, this technique cannot adequately visualize the small distal coronary arteries as accurately as conventional angiography performed during a cardiac catheterization.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 680</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page681" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="681">p. 681</span></div>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the magnetic field used during MRA, patients must be screened for contraindications for its use. Patients with any type of cardiac implantable electronic device need to be screened to see if it is safe for the patient to undergo the test (<a href="#bib1656">Indik, Gimbel, Abe, et al., 2017</a>). MRA cannot be performed on patients who have metal plates, prosthetic joints, or other metallic implants that can become dislodged if exposed to MRA. Patients are instructed to remove any jewelry, watches, or other metal items (e.g., ECG leads). Transdermal patches that contain a heat-conducting aluminized layer (e.g., nitroglycerin, clonidine, fentanyl) must be removed before MRA to prevent burning of the skin.</p>
<p class="indent">During MRA, the patient is positioned supine on a table that is placed into an enclosed imager or tube containing the magnetic field. A patient who is claustrophobic may need to receive a mild sedative before undergoing an MRA. An intermittent clanking or thumping that can be annoying is generated by the magnetic coils, so the patient may be offered a headset to listen to music. The scanner is equipped with a microphone so that the patient can communicate with the staff. The patient is instructed to remain motionless during the scan.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s800">Echocardiography</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Transthoracic Echocardiography</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Echocardiography is a noninvasive ultrasound test that is used to measure the ejection fraction and examine the size, shape, and motion of cardiac structures. It is particularly useful for diagnosing pericardial effusions; determining chamber size and the etiology of heart murmurs; evaluating the function of heart valves, including prosthetic heart valves; and evaluating ventricular wall motion.</p>
<p class="h7">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">Echocardiography involves transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the heart through the chest wall and the recording of the return signals. With the traditional transthoracic approach, the ultrasound is generated by a handheld transducer applied to the front of the chest. The transducer picks up the echoes and converts them to electrical impulses that are recorded and displayed on a monitor. It creates sophisticated, spatially correct images of the heart. An ECG is recorded simultaneously to assist in interpretation of the echocardiogram.</p>
<p class="indent">With the use of Doppler techniques, an echocardiogram can also show the direction and velocity of the blood flow through the heart. These techniques are used to assess for &#x201C;leaking valves,&#x201D; conditions referred to as valvular regurgitation, and will also detect abnormal blood flow between the septum of the left and right heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Echocardiography may be performed with an exercise or pharmacologic stress test. Images are obtained at rest and then immediately after the target heart rate is reached. Myocardial ischemia from decreased perfusion during stress causes abnormalities in ventricular wall motion and is easily detected by echocardiography. A stress test using echocardiography is considered positive if abnormalities in ventricular wall motion are detected during stress but not during rest. These findings are highly suggestive of CAD and require further evaluation, such as a cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before transthoracic echocardiography, the nurse informs the patient about the test, explaining that it is painless. Echocardiographic monitoring is performed while a transducer that emits sound waves is moved over the surface of the chest wall. Gel applied to the skin helps transmit the sound waves. Periodically, the patient is asked to turn onto the left side or hold a breath. The test takes about 30 to 45 minutes. If the patient is to undergo an exercise or pharmacologic stress test with echocardiography, information on stress testing is also reviewed with the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transesophageal Echocardiography</h6>
<p class="h7a">Procedure</p>
<p class="nonindent">A significant limitation of transthoracic echocardiography is the poor quality of the images produced. Ultrasound loses its clarity as it passes through tissue, lung, and bone. An alternative technique involves threading a small transducer through the mouth and into the esophagus. This technique, called <em>transesophageal echocardiography</em> (TEE), provides clearer images because ultrasound waves pass through less tissue. A topical anesthetic agent and sedation are used during TEE because of the discomfort associated with the positioning of the transducer in the esophagus (refer to <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> for further discussion of sedation for procedures). Once the patient is comfortable, the transducer is inserted into the mouth and the patient is asked to swallow several times until it is positioned in the esophagus.</p>
<p class="indent">The high-quality imaging obtained during TEE makes this technique an important first-line diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with many types of CVD, including HF, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and many other conditions that place the patient at risk for atrial or ventricular thrombi. Pharmacologic stress testing using dobutamine and TEE can also be performed. It is frequently used during cardiac surgery to continuously monitor the response of the heart to the surgical procedure (e.g., valve replacement or coronary artery bypass). Complications are uncommon during TEE; however, if they do occur, they are serious. These complications are caused by sedation and impaired swallowing resulting from the topical anesthesia (respiratory depression and aspiration) and by insertion and manipulation of the transducer into the esophagus and stomach (vasovagal response or esophageal perforation). The patient must be assessed before TEE for a history of dysphagia or radiation therapy to the chest, which increases the likelihood of complications.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to the test, the nurse provides preprocedure education and ensures that the patient has a clear understanding of what the test entails and why it is being performed, instructs the patient not to eat or drink anything for 6 hours prior to the study, and checks to make sure that informed consent has been obtained. The nurse also inserts an IV line or assesses an existing IV for patency and suitability and asks the patient to remove full or partial dentures. During the test, the nurse provides emotional support and monitors level of consciousness, BP, ECG, respiration, and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). During the recovery period, the patient must maintain bed rest with the head of the bed elevated to 45 degrees. Following the procedural sedation policy of the agency, the nurse monitors the patient for dyspnea and assesses vital signs, SpO<sub>2</sub>, level of consciousness, and gag reflex as recommended. Food and oral fluids are withheld until the patient is fully alert and the effects of the topical anesthetic agent are reversed, usually 2 hours after the procedure; if the gag reflex is intact, the nurse begins feeding with sips of water, then advances to the preprocedure diet. Patients are informed that a sore throat may be present for the next 24 hours; they are instructed to report the presence of a persistent sore throat, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing to the medical staff. If the procedure is performed in an outpatient setting, a family member or friend must be available to transport the patient home from the test site.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s801">Cardiac Catheterization</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cardiac catheterization:&lt;/b&gt; an invasive procedure used to measure cardiac chamber pressures and assess patency of the coronary arteries">Cardiac catheterization</button></strong> is a common invasive procedure used to diagnose structural and functional diseases of the heart and great vessels. The results guide treatment decisions including the need for revascularization (PCI or CABG) and other interventions to manage structural defects of the valves or septum (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">This procedure involves the percutaneous insertion of radiopaque catheters into a large vein and an artery. Fluoroscopy is used to guide the advancement of the catheters through the right and left heart, referred to as right and left heart catheterizations, respectively. In most situations, patients undergo both right and left heart catheterizations. However, right heart catheterization is performed without a left heart catheterization when patients only need myocardial biopsies or measurement of pulmonary artery pressures. Of note, left heart catheterization involves the use of a contrast agent. These agents are necessary to visualize patency of the coronary arteries and evaluate left ventricular function.</p>
<p class="indent">In preparation for the procedure, patients have blood tests performed to evaluate metabolic function (electrolytes and glucose) and renal function (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine level). Baseline coagulation studies (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], international normalized ratio [INR], and prothrombin time [PT]) are obtained to guide dosing of anticoagulation during the procedure. Because bleeding and hematoma formation are procedural risks, a complete blood cell count (CBC; includes the hematocrit, hemoglobin, and platelets) is necessary to establish baseline values. Later these results are compared with postprocedure results to monitor for blood loss.</p>
<p class="indent">A health history is obtained to assess for previous reactions to a contrast agent and determine if the patient has any risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). This uncommon complication is a form of acute kidney injury that is usually reversible. Patients with chronic kidney disease or renal insufficiency, diabetes, HF, hypotension, dehydration, use of nephrotoxic medications, and advanced age are at risk for CIN. CIN is defined as an increase in the baseline serum creatinine by 25% or more or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL within 48 to 72 hours after the administration of contrast (<a href="#bib1690">Urden et al., 2017</a>). See <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>, <a href="c47-sec03.xhtml#ct47-5">Chart&#x00A0;47-5</a> for further discussion of nursing care of patient undergoing imaging study with the use of a contrast agent.</p>
<p class="indent">During a cardiac catheterization, the patient has one or more IV catheters for administration of fluids, sedatives, heparin, and other medications. The patient is continuously monitored for chest pain or dyspnea and for changes in BP and ECG, which are indicative of myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic instability, or arrhythmias. Resuscitation equipment must be readily available, and staff must be prepared to provide advanced cardiac life support measures as necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Postprocedure, patients remain on bed rest for 2 to 6 hours before they are permitted to ambulate. Variations in time to ambulation are related to the size of the catheters used during the procedure, the site of catheter insertion (femoral or radial artery), the patient&#x2019;s anticoagulation status, and other factors (e.g., advanced age, obesity, bleeding disorder). The use of a radial access site and smaller (4- or 6-Fr) arterial catheters are associated with shorter bed rest restrictions.</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiac catheterization may be performed in the ambulatory setting. Unless the results demonstrate the need for immediate treatment, patients are discharged home. Hospitalized patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for diagnostic and interventional purposes (PCI, valvuloplasty) are returned to their hospital rooms for recovery (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Right Heart Catheterization</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Right heart catheterization usually precedes left heart catheterization. It is performed to assess the function of the right ventricle and tricuspid and pulmonary valves. The procedure involves the passage of a catheter from a brachial, internal jugular, or femoral vein into the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary arterioles. Pressures and oxygen saturations from each of these areas are obtained and recorded. The pulmonary artery pressures are used to diagnose pulmonary hypertension. A biopsy of a small piece of myocardial tissue can also be obtained during a right heart catheterization. The results of the biopsy are used to diagnose the etiology of a cardiomyopathy (abnormality of myocardium) or heart transplant rejection. At the completion of the procedure, the venous catheter is removed and hemostasis of the affected vein is achieved using manual pressure. Although right heart catheterization is considered relatively safe, potential complications include arrhythmias (from contact of the catheter with the endocardium), venous spasm, infection at the insertion site, and right heart perforation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Left Heart Catheterization</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Prior to left heart catheterization, patients who have previously experienced a reaction to a contrast agent are premedicated with antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) and corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone). Patients at risk for CIN receive pre- and postprocedure preventive strategies. IV saline <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page682" title="682"></span>hydration increases vascular volume, facilitates removal of contrast from the kidneys, and reduces the risk of CIN (<a href="#bib1667">Liu, Hong, Wang, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Left heart catheterization is performed to evaluate the aortic arch and its major branches, patency of the coronary arteries, and the function of the left ventricle and mitral and aortic valves. Left heart catheterization is performed by retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle. In this approach, the interventional cardiologist usually inserts the catheter into the right radial or a femoral artery and advances it into the aorta and left ventricle. Potential complications include arrhythmias, MI, perforation of the left heart or great vessels, and systemic embolization.</p>
<p class="indent">During a left heart catheterization, angiography is performed. Angiography is an imaging technique that involves the injection of the contrast agent into the arterial catheter. The contrast agent is filmed as it passes through the chambers of the left heart, aortic arch, and its major arteries. Coronary angiography is another technique used to observe the coronary artery anatomy and evaluate the degree of stenosis from atherosclerosis. To perform this test, a catheter is positioned into one of the coronary arteries. Once in position, the contrast agent is injected directly into the artery and images are obtained. The procedure is then repeated using the opposite coronary artery. Ventriculography is also performed to evaluate the size and function of the left ventricle. For this test, a catheter is positioned in the left ventricle and a large amount of contrast agent (30 mL) is rapidly injected into the ventricle.</p>
<p class="indent">The manipulation of catheters in the coronary arteries and left ventricle as well as injection of the contrast agent can cause intermittent myocardial ischemia. Vigilant monitoring throughout left heart catheterization is needed to detect myocardial ischemia, which can trigger chest pain and life-threatening arrhythmias.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the procedure is completed, the arterial catheter is withdrawn. There are several options available to achieve arterial hemostasis, including applying manual pressure and hemostatic devices available from numerous vendors. For the radial artery, a compression device, such as the Terumo TR Band<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>, is positioned over the artery. It has a mechanism that is inflated with air to put pressure against the artery. It remains in place for about 2 hours. A radial approach and a compression device are both common practices and are associated with lower risks for bleeding and vascular complications, as well as a shorter time to ambulation postprocedure (<a href="#bib1668">Mason, Shah, Tamis-Holland, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For the femoral approach, manual pressure may be used alone or in combination with mechanical compression devices such as the FemoStop<sup>&#x2122;</sup>. Many types of percutaneously deployed vascular closure devices are also available. These devices are positioned at the femoral arterial puncture site after completion of the procedure. They deploy a saline-soaked gelatin sponge (QUICKSEAL), collagen (VasoSeal), sutures (Perclose ProGlide<sup>&#x2122;</sup>), or a combination of both collagen and sutures (Angio-Seal). Other products that expedite arterial hemostasis include external patches (Syvek Patch, Clo-Sur P.A.D.). These products are placed over the puncture site as the catheter is removed and manual pressure is applied for 4 to 10 minutes. Once hemostasis is achieved, the patch is covered with a dressing that remains in place for 24 hours. The interventional cardiologist determines which closure device, if any, will be deployed based on the artery used to insert the catheter, patient&#x2019;s condition, device availability, and personal preference.</p>
<p class="indent">Major benefits of the vascular closure devices include reliable, immediate hemostasis and a shorter time on bed rest without a significant increase in bleeding or other complications. Rare complications associated with these devices include bleeding around the closure device, infection, and arterial obstruction.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing responsibilities before cardiac catheterization include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Instructing the patient to fast, usually for 8 to 12 hours, before the procedure.</span></li>
<li><span>Informing the patient that if catheterization is to be performed as an outpatient procedure, a friend, family member, or other responsible person must transport the patient home.</span></li>
<li><span>Informing the patient about the expected duration of the procedure and advising that it will involve lying on a hard table for less than 2 hours.</span></li>
<li><span>Reassuring the patient that IV medications are given to maintain comfort.</span></li>
<li><span>Informing the patient about sensations that will be experienced during the catheterization. Knowing what to expect can help the patient cope with the experience. The nurse explains that an occasional pounding sensation (palpitation) may be felt in the chest because of extra heartbeats that almost always occur, particularly when the catheter tip touches the endocardium. The patient may be asked to cough and to breathe deeply, especially after the injection of the contrast agent. Coughing may help disrupt an arrhythmia and clear the contrast agent from the arteries. Breathing deeply and holding the breath help lower the diaphragm for better visualization of heart structures. The injection of a contrast agent into either side of the heart may produce a flushed feeling throughout the body and a sensation similar to the need to void, which subsides in 1 minute or less.</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Encouraging the patient to express fears and anxieties. The nurse provides education and reassurance to reduce apprehension.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing responsibilities after cardiac catheterization are guided by hospital policy and primary provider preferences and may include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Observing the catheter access site for bleeding or hematoma formation and assessing peripheral pulses in the affected extremity (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in the lower extremity, radial pulse in the upper extremity) every 15 minutes for 1 hour, every 30 minutes for 1 hour, and hourly for 4 hours or until discharge. BP and heart rate are also assessed during these same time intervals.</span></li>
<li><span>Evaluating temperature, color, and capillary refill of the affected extremity during these same time intervals. The patient is assessed for affected extremity pain, numbness, or tingling sensations that may indicate arterial insufficiency. The best technique to use is to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page683" title="683"></span>compare the examination findings between the affected and unaffected extremities. Any changes are reported promptly.</span></li>
<li><span>Screening carefully for arrhythmias by observing the cardiac monitor or by assessing the apical and peripheral pulses for changes in rate and rhythm. A vasovagal reaction, consisting of bradycardia, hypotension, and nausea, can be precipitated by a distended bladder or by discomfort from manual pressure that is applied during removal of an arterial or venous catheter. The vasovagal response is reversed by promptly elevating the lower extremities above the level of the heart, infusing a bolus of IV fluid, and administering IV atropine to treat the bradycardia.</span></li>
<li><span>Maintaining activity restrictions for 2 to 6 hours after the procedure. The determination of bed rest, chair activity, and time to commence ambulation is dependent upon location of arterial approach, size of the catheter used during the procedure, medications administered, and method used to maintain hemostasis. If manual pressure or a mechanical device was used during a femoral artery approach, the patient remains on bed rest for up to 6 hours with the affected leg straight and the head of the bed elevated no greater than 30 degrees. For comfort, the patient may be turned from side to side with the affected extremity straight. If a percutaneous vascular closure device or patch was deployed, the nurse checks local nursing care standards and anticipates that the patient will have fewer activity restrictions. If the radial closure device was used, the patient can sit up in a chair until the effects of sedation have dissipated, and early ambulation is encouraged. After the vascular closure device removal, a dressing is applied over the catheter access site. Patients can return to normal activities the day after the procedure but must avoid strenuous wrist activities for several days (<a href="#bib1690">Mason et al., 2018</a>). Analgesic medication is given as prescribed for discomfort.</span></li>
<li><span>Instructing the patient to report chest pain and bleeding or sudden discomfort from the catheter insertion sites promptly.</span></li>
<li><span>Monitoring the patient for CIN by observing for elevations in serum creatinine levels. IV hydration is used to increase urinary output and flush the contrast agent from the urinary tract; accurate oral and IV intake and urinary output are recorded.</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Ensuring patient safety by instructing the patient to ask for help when getting out of bed the first time after the procedure. The patient is monitored for bleeding from the catheter access site and for orthostatic hypotension, indicated by complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients being discharged from the hospital on the same day as the procedure, additional instructions are provided (<a href="#ct21-6">Chart&#x00A0;21-6</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s802">Electrophysiologic Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The electrophysiology study (EPS) is an invasive procedure that plays a major role in the diagnosis and management of serious arrhythmias. EPS may be indicated for patients with syncope, palpitations, or both, and for survivors of cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation (sudden cardiac death) (<a href="#bib1662">Kusumoto, Schoenfeld, Barrett, et al., 2019</a>). EPS is used to distinguish atrial from ventricular tachycardias when the determination cannot be made from the 12-lead ECG; to evaluate how readily a life-threatening arrhythmia (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) can be induced; to evaluate AV node function; to evaluate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic medications in suppressing the arrhythmia; or to determine the need for other therapeutic interventions, such as a cardiac implantable electronic device, or radiofrequency ablation. (See <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> for a detailed discussion of EPS.)</p>

<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong><strong>Self-Management After Cardiac Catheterization</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">After discharge from the hospital for cardiac catheterization, patients should follow these guidelines for self-care:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>If the artery in your wrist artery was used:</em> Return to normal activities tomorrow. Strenuous activities of the wrist such as manual labor, tennis, or driving may be restricted for a few days per your provider&#x2019;s orders.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><em>If the artery in your groin was used:</em> For the next 24 hours, do not bend at the waist, strain, or lift heavy objects.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s803"><img class="m" src="images/xxiii-5.jpg" alt=""/> Hemodynamic Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Critically ill patients require continuous assessment of their cardiovascular system to diagnose and manage their complex medical conditions. This type of assessment is achieved by the use of direct pressure monitoring systems, referred to as hemodynamic monitoring. Common forms include CVP, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page684" title="684"></span>pulmonary artery pressure, and intra-arterial BP monitoring. Patients requiring hemodynamic monitoring are cared for in critical care units. Some progressive care units also admit stable patients with CVP, pulmonary artery catheters, or intra-arterial BP monitoring. To perform hemodynamic monitoring, a CVP, pulmonary artery, or arterial catheter is introduced into the appropriate blood vessel or heart chamber. It is connected to a pressure monitoring system that has several components, including:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>A disposable flush system, composed of IV normal saline solution, tubing, stopcocks, and a flush device, which provides continuous and manual flushing of the system.</span></li>
<li><span>A pressure bag placed around the flush solution that is maintained at 300 mm Hg of pressure. The pressurized flush system delivers 3 to 5 mL of solution per hour through the catheter to prevent clotting and backflow of blood into the pressure monitoring system.</span></li>
<li><span>A transducer to convert the pressure coming from the artery or heart chamber into an electrical signal.</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>An amplifier or monitor, which increases the size of the electrical signal for display on an oscilloscope.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses caring for patients who require hemodynamic monitoring receive training prior to using this sophisticated technology. The nurse helps ensure safe and effective care by adhering to the following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Ensuring that the system is set up and maintained properly. For example, the pressure monitoring system must be kept patent and free of air bubbles.</span></li>
<li><span>Checking that the stopcock of the transducer is positioned at the level of the atrium before the system is used to obtain pressure measurements. This landmark is referred to as the phlebostatic axis (<a href="#ff21-10">Fig.&#x00A0;21-10</a>). The nurse uses a marker to identify this level on the chest wall, which provides a stable reference point for subsequent pressure readings.</span></li></ul>
<p class="Box8BL1Last"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Establishing the zero reference point in order to ensure that the system is properly functioning at atmospheric pressure. This process is accomplished by placing the stopcock of the transducer at the phlebostatic axis, opening the transducer to air, and activating the zero function key on the bedside monitor. Measurements of CVP, BP, and pulmonary artery pressures can be made with the head of the bed elevated up to 60 degrees; however, the system must be repositioned to the phlebostatic axis to ensure an accurate reading (<a href="#bib1690">Urden et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications from the use of hemodynamic monitoring systems are uncommon and can include pneumothorax, infection, and air embolism. The nurse observes for signs of pneumothorax during the insertion of catheters using a central venous approach (CVP and pulmonary artery catheters). The longer any of these catheters are left in place (after 72 to 96 hours), the greater the risk of infection. Air emboli can be introduced into the vascular system if the stopcocks attached to the pressure transducers are mishandled during blood drawing, administration of medications, or other procedures that require opening the system to air. Therefore, nurses handling this equipment must demonstrate competence prior to caring independently for a patient requiring hemodynamic monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent">Catheter-related bloodstream infections are the most common preventable complication associated with hemodynamic monitoring systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published comprehensive guidelines for the prevention of these infections (O&#x2019;Grady, Alexander, Burns, et al., 2011; Talbot, Stone, Irwin, et al., 2017). To minimize the risk of infection, a group of evidence-based interventions, called a care <em>bundle,</em> should be implemented.</p>
<p class="indent">The CDC and Infusion Nursing Society have additional infection control guidelines that pertain to the ongoing care of these patients, including skin care, dressing changes, and line and connector care that are outlined in <a href="#tt21-5">Table&#x00A0;21-5</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Central Venous Pressure Monitoring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">CVP is a measurement of the pressure in the vena cava or right atrium. The pressure in the vena cava, right atrium, and right ventricle is equal at the end of diastole; thus, the CVP also reflects the filling pressure of the right ventricle (preload). The normal CVP is 2 to 6 mm Hg. It is measured by positioning a catheter in the vena cava or right atrium and connecting it to a pressure monitoring system. The CVP is most valuable when it is monitored over time and correlated with the patient&#x2019;s clinical status. A CVP greater than 6 mm Hg indicates an elevated right ventricular preload. There are many problems that can cause an elevated CVP, but the most common problem is hypervolemia (excessive fluid circulating in the body) or right-sided HF. In contrast, a low CVP (less than 2 mm Hg) indicates reduced right ventricular preload, which is most often from hypovolemia. Dehydration, excessive blood loss, vomiting or diarrhea, and overdiuresis can result in hypovolemia and a low CVP. This diagnosis can be substantiated when a rapid IV infusion of fluid causes the CVP to increase.</p>

The preferred site is the subclavian vein; the femoral vein is generally avoided (O&#x2019;Grady et al., 2011). A local anesthetic agent is used. During this sterile procedure, the physician threads a single-lumen or multilumen catheter through the vein into the vena cava just above or within the right atrium. Once the CVP catheter is inserted, it is secured and a dry sterile dressing is applied. Position of the catheter is confirmed by a chest x-ray.</p>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">The frequency of CVP measurements is dictated by the patient&#x2019;s condition and the treatment plan. In addition to obtaining pressure readings, the CVP catheter is used for infusing IV fluids, administering IV medications, and drawing blood specimens. Nursing care of the patient with a CVP catheter follows central line and pressure tubing guidelines (see <a href="#tt21-5">Table&#x00A0;21-5</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pulmonary Artery Pressure Monitoring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is used in critical care for assessing left ventricular function, diagnosing the etiology of shock, and evaluating the patient&#x2019;s response to medical interventions (e.g., fluid administration, vasoactive medications). A pulmonary artery catheter and a pressure monitoring system are used. A variety of catheters are available for cardiac pacing, oximetry, cardiac output measurement, or a combination of functions. Pulmonary artery catheters are balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheters that have distal and proximal lumens (<a href="#ff21-11">Fig.&#x00A0;21-11</a>). The distal lumen has a port that opens into the pulmonary artery. Once connected by its hub to the pressure monitoring system, it is used only to continuously measure pulmonary artery pressures. The proximal lumen has a port that opens into the right atrium. It is used to administer IV medications and fluids or to monitor right atrial pressures (i.e., CVP). Each catheter has a balloon inflation hub and valve. A syringe is connected to the hub, which is used to inflate or deflate the balloon with air (maximum 1.5-mL capacity). The valve opens and closes the balloon inflation lumen.</p>
<p class="indent">A pulmonary artery catheter with specialized capabilities has additional components. For example, the thermodilution catheter has three additional features that enable it to measure cardiac output: a thermistor connector attached to the cardiac output computer of the bedside monitor, a proximal injectate port used for injecting fluids when obtaining the cardiac output, and a thermistor (positioned near the distal port) (see <a href="#ff21-11">Fig.&#x00A0;21-11</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The pulmonary artery catheter, covered with a sterile sleeve, is inserted into a large vein, preferably the subclavian, through a sheath. As noted previously, the femoral vein is avoided; insertion techniques and protocols mirror those used for inserting a CVP catheter (see previous discussion) (O&#x2019;Grady et al., 2011). The sheath is equipped with a side port for infusing IV fluids and medications. The catheter is then passed into the vena cava and right atrium. In the right atrium, the balloon tip is inflated, and the catheter is carried rapidly by the flow of blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, through the pulmonic valve, and into a branch of the pulmonary artery. When the catheter reaches the pulmonary artery, the balloon is deflated and the catheter is secured with sutures (<a href="#ff21-12">Fig.&#x00A0;21-12</a>). Fluoroscopy may be used during insertion to visualize the progression of the catheter through the right heart chambers to the pulmonary artery. This procedure can be performed in the operating room, in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, or at the bedside in the critical care unit. During insertion of the pulmonary artery catheter, the bedside monitor is observed for pressure and waveform changes, as well as arrhythmias, as the catheter progresses through the right heart to the pulmonary artery.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the catheter is in position, the following are measured: right atrial, pulmonary artery systolic, pulmonary artery diastolic, mean pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures (see <a href="c21-sec01.xhtml#ff21-2">Fig.&#x00A0;21-2</a> for normal chamber pressures). Monitoring of the pulmonary artery diastolic and pulmonary artery wedge pressures is particularly important in critically ill patients because they are used to evaluate left ventricular filling pressures (i.e., left ventricular preload).</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to note that the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is achieved by inflating the balloon tip for a maximum of 15 seconds, which causes it to float more distally into a smaller portion of the pulmonary artery until it is wedged into position. This is an occlusive maneuver that impedes blood flow through that segment of the pulmonary artery. Therefore, the wedge pressure is measured immediately and the balloon deflated promptly to restore blood flow.</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>After measuring the pulmonary artery wedge pressure, the nurse ensures that the balloon is deflated and that the catheter has returned to its normal position. This important intervention is verified by evaluating the return of the pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic waveform displayed on the bedside monitor.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Catheter site care is essentially the same as for a CVP catheter. Similar to CVP measurement, the transducer must be positioned at the phlebostatic axis to ensure accurate readings (see <a href="#ff21-10">Fig.&#x00A0;21-10</a>). Serious complications include pulmonary artery rupture, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary infarction, catheter kinking, arrhythmias, and air embolism.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intra-Arterial Blood Pressure Monitoring</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intra-arterial BP monitoring is used to obtain direct and continuous BP measurements in critically ill patients who have severe hypertension or hypotension. Arterial catheters are also useful when arterial blood gas measurements and blood samples need to be obtained frequently.</p>
<p class="indent">The radial artery is the usual site selected. However, placement of a catheter into the radial artery can further impede perfusion to an area that has poor circulation. As a result, the tissue distal to the cannulated artery can become ischemic or necrotic. Patients with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or hypotension, receiving IV vasopressors, or having had previous surgery are at highest risk for this complication. Before arterial line insertion, two tests may be considered to assess circulation; namely, a Doppler ultrasound or a modified Allen&#x2019;s test. A Doppler ultrasound assesses blood flow of the artery. The modified Allen&#x2019;s test assesses collateral circulation. To perform the Allen&#x2019;s test, the patient&#x2019;s hand is elevated and the patient is asked to make a fist. The nurse compresses the radial and ulnar arteries simultaneously, causing the hand to blanch. After the patient opens the fist, the nurse releases the pressure on the ulnar artery. If blood flow is restored (hand turns pink) within 7 seconds, the circulation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page687" title="687"></span>to the hand may be adequate enough to tolerate placement of a radial artery catheter (<a href="#bib1690">Wiegand, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Nursing Interventions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Site preparation and care are the same as for CVP catheters. The catheter flush solution is normal saline, which is the same as for CVP and pulmonary artery catheters. A transducer is attached, and pressures are measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). The nurse monitors the patient for complications, which include local obstruction with distal ischemia, external hemorrhage, massive ecchymosis, dissection, air embolism, blood loss, pain, arteriospasm, and infection.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Minimally Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring&#x00A0;Devices</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Monitoring cardiac output using the pulmonary artery catheter has been the standard of practice in critical care since its inception over 50 years ago. Its use has diminished recently with the availability of new, less invasive devices. Several types of devices are commercially available. Selection of a specific device for clinical use is determined by availability, provider preferences, and the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition (<a href="#bib1690">Urden et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Pulse pressure analysis uses an arterial pressure waveform to continuously estimate the patient&#x2019;s stroke volume. One such device, the Edwards Lifesciences Vigileo monitoring <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page688" title="688"></span>system, is connected to an existing radial or femoral arterial line via its FloTrac transducer. Using age, gender, body surface area, and BP of the patient, this device calculates continuous cardiac output and other parameters used in the management of critically ill patients. The major drawback to this device is that in order for it to capture accurate data, it must first capture optimal arterial waveforms. Therefore, this type of device has limited usefulness in patients with poor waveform signals, some arrhythmias, hemodynamic instability, and those who may be concomitantly using an intra-aortic balloon pump (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Esophageal Doppler probes are used to noninvasively estimate cardiac output. The esophageal probe measures blood flow velocity within a cross-sectional area of the descending aorta to calculate cardiac output. The use of this device in the perioperative setting has been shown to improve patient outcomes, including decreased lengths of hospital stay and an overall decrease in rates of complications (<a href="#bib1690">Urden et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The Fick method, which uses carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) measures, is an additional method used to estimate cardiac output. To obtain cardiac output using this method, a rebreathing loop is attached to the ventilator along with an infrared CO<sub>2</sub> sensor, an airflow sensor, and pulse oximeter. Continuous readings of cardiac output may be updated every 3 minutes with the use of this device. As an alternative, a Fick calculation may be done that uses the patient&#x2019;s body surface area and oxygen consumption (arterial and venous saturations and hemoglobin) to determine cardiac output.</p>
