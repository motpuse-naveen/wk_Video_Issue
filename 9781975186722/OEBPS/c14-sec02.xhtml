<h4 class="h4" id="s451">Advances in Surgical and Anesthesia Approaches</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Technologic advancements continue to lead health care industry providers toward performing more complex procedures that are less invasive, and therefore cause less morbidity during the recovery phase of surgery (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Minimally invasive and robotic surgeries are continuing to replace traditional surgical procedures. Advancements in surgical technology allow for shorter hospital stays and promote patient comfort (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Sadler, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The fastest growing trend in recent years is the use of robotic surgery (see <a href="c14-sec04.xhtml#ff14-1">Fig.&#x00A0;14-1</a>). Robotic surgery offers many advantages over laparoscopic surgery including more precise accuracy for dissecting and suturing, better range of motion of the instruments, enhanced ability to access deep structures, and attain three-dimensional visual feedback (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Robotic surgery is used in a wide variety of surgical specialties such as cardiac; gastrointestinal; urologic; gynecologic; ear, nose, and throat (ENT); thoracic; and orthopedic.</p>
<p class="indent">Enhanced anesthesia methodology complements advances in surgical technology. Modern methods of achieving airway patency, sophisticated monitoring devices, and new pharmacologic agents, such as short-acting anesthetics, have created a safer atmosphere in which to operate. Effective antiemetics have reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Improved postoperative pain management and shortened procedure and recovery times have improved the operative experience for surgical patients.</p>
