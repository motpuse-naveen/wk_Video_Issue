<p class="nonindent">The ED is a common point of entry into the health care system for patients 65 years and older. The CDC (2017b) reports that 32% of ED visits by patients older than 65 years resulted in hospital admission. As age increases, the percentage of admissions increases. Of these admissions, 17% were related to trauma, primarily falls (CDC, 2017b). Older adult patients typically arrive with one or more presenting conditions. Nonspecific symptoms, such as weakness and fatigue, episodes of falling, incontinence, and change in mental status, may be manifestations of acute, potentially life-threatening illness in the older person. Emergencies in this age group may be more difficult to manage because older adult patients may have an atypical presentation, an altered response to treatment, a greater risk of developing complications, or a combination of these factors.</p>
<p class="indent">The older adult patient may perceive the emergency as a crisis signaling the end of an independent lifestyle or even death. The nurse should give attention to the patient&#x2019;s feelings of anxiety and fear (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Cortez, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The older adult patient may have limited sources of social and financial support during times of crises. The nurse should assess the psychosocial resources of the patient (and of the caregiver, if necessary) and anticipate discharge needs. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2185" title="2185"></span>Referrals for support services (e.g., to the social service department or a gerontologic nurse specialist) may be necessary.</p>
