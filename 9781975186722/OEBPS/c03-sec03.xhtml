<h5 class="h5" id="s35">Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment in the teaching&#x2013;learning process is directed toward the systematic collection of data about the patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s learning needs and readiness to learn. The nurse identifies all internal and external variables that affect the patient&#x2019;s readiness to learn. Many learning assessment guides are available. Some guides are directed toward the collection of general health information (e.g., healthy eating), whereas others are specific to medication regimens or disease processes (e.g., stroke risk assessments). Such guides facilitate assessment but must be adapted to the responses, problems, and needs of each person. The nurse organizes, analyzes, synthesizes, and summarizes the assessment data collected and determines the patient&#x2019;s need for teaching.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s36">Nursing Diagnosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The process of formulating nursing diagnoses makes educational goals and evaluations of progress more specific and meaningful. Teaching is an integral intervention implied by all nursing diagnoses, and for some diagnoses, education is the primary intervention. Examples of nursing diagnoses that help in planning for educational needs are impaired health maintenance and decisional conflict. A nursing diagnosis that relates specifically to a patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s learning needs serves as a guide in the development of the teaching plan.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s37">Planning</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Once the nursing diagnoses have been identified, the planning component of the teaching&#x2013;learning process is established in accordance with the steps of the nursing process:</p>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span>Assigning priorities to the diagnoses</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">2.</span>Specifying the immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals of learning</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">3.</span>Identifying specific teaching strategies appropriate for attaining goals</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">4.</span>Specifying the expected outcomes</p>
<p class="NL1Middle"><span class="numah">5.</span>Documenting the diagnoses, goals, teaching strategies, and expected outcomes of the teaching plan</p>
<p class="indent">The assignment of priorities to the diagnoses should be a collaborative effort by the nurse and the patient or family members. Consideration must be given to the urgency of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page62" title="62"></span>the patient&#x2019;s learning needs; the most critical needs should receive the highest priority.</p>

<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">The nurse needs to keep in mind that before the teaching strategy can be determined, the goals of learning must be developed.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">After the diagnostic priorities have been mutually established, it is important to identify the immediate and long-term goals and the teaching strategies appropriate for attaining the goals. Teaching is most effective when the objectives of both the patient and the nurse are in agreement (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Bastable, 2017</a>). Learning begins with the establishment of goals that are appropriate to the situation and realistic in terms of the patient&#x2019;s ability and desire to achieve them. Involving the patient and family in establishing goals and in planning teaching strategies promotes their cooperation in the implementation of the teaching plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Outcomes of teaching strategies can be stated in terms of expected behaviors of patients, families, or both. Outcomes should be realistic and measurable, and the critical time periods for attaining them should be identified. The desired outcomes and the critical time periods serve as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the teaching strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">During the planning phase, the nurse must consider the sequence in which the subject matter is presented. Critical information (e.g., survival skills for a patient with diabetes) and material that the person or family identifies to be of particular importance must receive high priority. An outline is often helpful for arranging the subject matter and for ensuring that all necessary information is included. In addition, appropriate teaching aids to be used in implementing teaching strategies are prepared or selected at this time. Patient Education charts throughout this textbook guide teaching about self-care.</p>
<p class="indent">The entire planning phase concludes with the formulation of the teaching plan. This teaching plan communicates the following information to all members of the nursing team:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>The nursing diagnoses that specifically relate to the patient&#x2019;s learning needs and the priorities of these diagnoses</span></li>
<li><span>The goals of the teaching strategies</span></li>
<li><span>The teaching strategies that are appropriate for goal attainment</span></li>
<li><span>The expected outcomes, which identify the desired behavioral responses of the learner</span></li>
<li><span>The critical time period within which each outcome is expected to be met</span></li></ul>
<p class="BL1Last"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page63" title="63"></span><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>The patient&#x2019;s behavioral responses (which are documented on the teaching plan)</p>
<p class="indent">The same rules that apply to writing and revising the plan of nursing care apply to the teaching plan.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s38">Implementation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the implementation phase of the teaching&#x2013;learning process, the patient, family, and other members of the nursing and health care team carry out the activities outlined in the teaching plan. The nurse coordinates these activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Flexibility during the implementation phase of the teaching&#x2013;learning process and ongoing assessment of patient responses to the teaching strategies support modification of the teaching plan as necessary. Creativity in promoting and sustaining the patient&#x2019;s motivation to learn is essential. New learning needs that may arise after discharge from the hospital or after home care visits have ended should also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="indent">The implementation phase ends when the teaching strategies have been completed and when the patient&#x2019;s responses to the actions have been recorded. This serves as the basis for evaluating how well the defined goals and expected outcomes have been achieved.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s39">Evaluation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Evaluation of the teaching&#x2013;learning process determines how effectively the patient has responded to teaching and to what extent the goals have been achieved. An evaluation must be made to determine what was effective and what needs to be changed or reinforced. It cannot be assumed that patients have learned just because teaching has occurred; learning does not automatically follow teaching. An important part of the evaluation phase addresses the question, &#x201C;What could be done to improve teaching and enhance learning?&#x201D; Answers to this question direct the changes to be made in the teaching plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Various measurement techniques can be used to identify changes in patient behavior as evidence that learning has taken place. These techniques include directly observing the behavior; using rating scales, checklists, or anecdotal notes to document the behavior; and indirectly measuring results using oral questioning and written tests. All direct measurements should be supplemented with indirect measurements whenever possible. Using more than one measuring technique enhances the reliability of the resulting data and decreases the potential for error from a measurement strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">In many situations, measurement of actual behavior is the most accurate and appropriate evaluation technique. Nurses often perform comparative analyses using patient admission data as the baseline: Selected data points observed when nursing care is given and self-care is initiated are compared with the patient&#x2019;s baseline data. In other cases, indirect measurement may be used. Some examples of indirect measurement are patient satisfaction surveys, attitude surveys, and instruments that evaluate specific health status variables.</p>
<p class="indent">Measurement is only the beginning of evaluation, which must be followed by data interpretation and judgments about learning and teaching. These aspects of evaluation should be conducted periodically throughout the teaching&#x2013;learning program, at its conclusion, and at varying periods after the teaching has ended.</p>
<p class="indent">Evaluation of learning after teaching that occurs in any setting (e.g., clinics, offices, nursing centers, hospitals) is essential, because the analysis of teaching outcomes must extend into aftercare. With shortened lengths of hospital stay and with short-stay and same-day surgical procedures, follow-up evaluation is especially important. Coordination of efforts and sharing of information between hospital- and community-based nursing personnel facilitate postdischarge teaching and home care evaluation.</p>
<p class="indent">Evaluation is not the final step in the teaching&#x2013;learning process but is the beginning of a new patient assessment. The information gathered during evaluation should be used to redirect teaching actions, with the goal of improving the patient&#x2019;s responses and outcomes.</p>
