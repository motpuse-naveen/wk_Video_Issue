<h4 class="h4" id="s2268">Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">A nurse who is obtaining information from a woman for the health history and performing physical assessment is in an ideal position to discuss the woman&#x2019;s general health issues, health promotion, and health-related concerns. Relevant topics include fitness, nutrition, cardiovascular risks, health screening, sexuality, menopause, abuse, health risk behaviors, emotional well-being, and immunizations. Select health screening and counseling issues are summarized in <a href="c50-sec02.xhtml#ct50-1">Chart&#x00A0;50-1</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2269">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the general health history, the nurse asks about past illnesses and experiences specific to a woman&#x2019;s health. Data should be collected about the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Menstrual history (including onset, length of cycles, duration and amount of flow, presence of cramps or pain, bleeding between periods or after penile-vaginal intercourse, bleeding after menopause)</span></li>
<li><span>Pregnancies (number of pregnancies, outcomes of pregnancies)</span></li>
<li><span>Exposure to medications (diethylstilbestrol, immunosuppressive agents, others)</span></li>

<li><span>Sexual history</span></li>
<li><span>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and methods of treatment</span></li>
<li><span>Current or previous sexual abuse or physical abuse</span></li>
<li><span>Past surgery or other procedures on reproductive tract structures (including female genital mutilation [FGM] or female circumcision)</span></li>
<li><span>Chronic illness or disability that may affect health status, reproductive health, need for health screening, or access to health care</span></li>

<p class="indent">In collecting data related to reproductive health, the nurse can educate the patient about normal physiologic processes, such as menstruation and menopause, and assess possible abnormalities. Many problems experienced by young or middle-aged women can be corrected easily. However, if they are not treated, they may result in anxiety and health problems. Issues related to sexuality and sexual function are typically more often brought to the attention of the gynecologic or women&#x2019;s health care provider than other health care providers; however, nurses caring for all women should consider these issues part of routine health assessment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sexual History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A sexual assessment includes both subjective and objective data and should be included in care of people from adolescence through advanced age. Health and sexual histories, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are all part of the database. The purpose of a sexual history is to obtain information that provides a picture of a woman&#x2019;s sexuality and sexual practices and to promote sexual health. It may lead to discussion about sexually transmitted illnesses, unintended pregnancies, and ways of reducing high-risk sexual behaviors (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Herbert, 2018</a>). The sexual history may enable a patient to discuss sexual matters openly and to discuss sexual concerns with an informed health professional. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, excellent communication skills are essential when taking a sexual history (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Herbert, 2018</a>). This information can be obtained after the gynecologic&#x2013;obstetric or genitourinary history is completed. By incorporating the sexual history into the general health history, the nurse can move from areas of lesser sensitivity to areas of greater sensitivity after establishing initial rapport.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking the sexual history becomes a dynamic process reflecting an exchange of information between the patient and the nurse and provides the opportunity to clarify myths and explore areas of concern that the patient may not have felt comfortable discussing in the past. In obtaining a sexual history, the nurse must not assume the patient&#x2019;s sexual orientation until clarified. When asking about sexual health, the nurse also cannot assume that the patient is married or unmarried. Asking a patient to label herself as single, married, widowed, or divorced may be considered by some women as inappropriate. Asking about a partner or about current meaningful relationships may be a less offensive way to initiate a sexual history.</p>
<p class="indent">The PLISSIT (<em>p</em>ermission, <em>l</em>imited <em>i</em>nformation, <em>s</em>pecific <em>s</em>uggestions, <em>i</em>ntensive <em>t</em>herapy) model of sexual assessment and intervention may be used to provide a framework for nursing interventions (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3615">Annon, 1976</a>). The assessment begins by introducing the topic and asking the woman for permission to discuss issues related to sexuality with her. See <a href="c53.xhtml">Chapter 53</a> for further discussion of sexual history.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse can begin by explaining the purpose of obtaining a sexual history (e.g., &#x201C;I ask all my patients about their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1647" title="1647"></span>sexual health. May I ask you some questions about this?&#x201D;). History taking continues by inquiring about gender identity and sexual orientation (see <a href="c54.xhtml">Chapter 54</a>, <a href="c54-sec04.xhtml#ct54-1">Chart&#x00A0;54-1</a> for further discussion about how to assess for personal information), followed by inquiring about sexual activity (e.g., &#x201C;Are you currently having sex? With a man, woman, both, or a gender questioning or nonconforming person?&#x201D;). Inquiries about possible sexual dysfunction may include, &#x201C;Are you having any problems related to your current sexual performance?&#x201D; Such problems may be related to medication, life changes, disability, or the onset of physical or emotional illness. A patient can be asked about her thoughts on what is causing the current problem (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Information about sexual function can be introduced during the health history (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>). By initiating an assessment about sexual concerns, the nurse communicates to the patient that issues about changes or problems in sexual functioning are valid health issues, which provides a safe environment for discussing these sensitive topics. Young women may be apprehensive about having irregular periods, may be concerned about STIs, or may need contraception. They may want information about using tampons, emergency contraception, or issues related to pregnancy. Women who are perimenopausal may have concerns about irregular menses. Women who are menopausal may be concerned about vaginal dryness and discomfort with penile-vaginal intercourse. Women of any age may have concerns about relationships, sexual satisfaction, orgasm, or masturbation.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk of STIs can be assessed by asking about the number of sexual partners in the past year or in the patient&#x2019;s lifetime. An open-ended question related to the patient&#x2019;s need for further information should be included (e.g., &#x201C;Do you have any questions or concerns about your sexual health?&#x201D;). Women can be advised that sexual activity should never be painful; pain should be investigated by a care provider. They should also be encouraged to talk openly about their sexual feelings with their partner; in an intimate relationship, feelings are facts.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Female Genital Mutilation or Cutting</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injuries to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons. FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person&#x2019;s rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3672">World Health Organization [WHO], 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications for patients who have undergone FGM can include infertility, childbirth complications, impaired bladder function, and urinary complications. The practice is most common in the western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, in some countries in Asia and the Middle East, and among migrants from these areas (WHO, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses caring for patients who have undergone FGM need to be sensitive, empathetic, knowledgeable, culturally competent, and nonjudgmental. Respect for others&#x2019; health beliefs, practices, and behaviors, as well as recognition of the complexity of issues involved, is crucial. The nurse should use terminology with which the woman is familiar; <em>cutting</em> is usually a more acceptable term than <em>mutilation.</em> Speculums are not used in some developing countries; the function of this instrument should be explained, and an appropriately sized speculum used to examine women who have experienced FGM.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Intimate Partner Violence</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a preventable public health problem affecting more than 32 million Americans (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Weil, 2019</a>). IPV involves four main types of violence: physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately one in four women in the United States has experienced one or more of the four forms of IPV, with lifetime costs of more than $6.3 trillion (CDC, 2019a). Violence is rarely a one-time occurrence in a relationship; it usually continues and escalates in severity. This is an important point to emphasize when a woman states that her partner has hurt her but has promised to change. Perpetrators can change their behavior, although not without extensive counseling and motivation. Sixteen percent of homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner (CDC, 2019a). If a woman states that she is being hurt, sensitive care is required (see <a href="#ct50-3">Chart&#x00A0;50-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">By knowing about this major public health problem, being alert to abuse-related problems, and learning how to elicit information from women about abuse, maltreatment, and neglect in their lives, nurses can intervene to assist the patient in addressing a problem that might otherwise go undetected and thus save lives by making women safer through education and support. As part of a comprehensive assessment, the nurse should ensure a safe environment (i.e., a private room with the door closed) and ask each woman about violence in her life. More information on family violence, abuse, and neglect, including sexual assault and rape, can be found in <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">No specific signs or symptoms are diagnostic of abuse; however, nurses may see an injury that does not fit the account of how it happened (e.g., a bruise on the side of the upper arm after &#x201C;I walked into a door&#x201D;). Manifestations of abuse, maltreatment, and neglect may involve suicide attempts, drug and alcohol abuse, frequent emergency department visits, vague pelvic pain, somatic complaints, and depression. However, there may be no obvious signs or symptoms. Women in abusive situations have higher levels of depression (CDC, 2019a) and often report that they &#x201C;do not feel well,&#x201D; possibly due to the stress or fear and anticipation of impending abuse.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Incest and Childhood Sexual Abuse</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses may encounter women who have been sexually traumatized. Female survivors of sexual abuse are reported to have more mental and physical health problems than women who were not victims of abuse (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3641">Hailes, Yu, Danese, et al., 2019</a>). Victims of childhood sexual abuse are reported to experience more depression (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Hailes et al., 2019</a>), posttraumatic stress disorder, morbid obesity, marital instability, gastrointestinal problems, and headaches, as well as use health care services more frequently than people who were not victims. In women, chronic pelvic pain is often associated with physical violence, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1648" title="1648"></span>emotional neglect, and sexual abuse in childhood (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3643">Harris, Wieser, Vitonis, et al., 2018</a>). Women who have experienced rape or sexual abuse may be very anxious about pelvic examinations, labor, pelvic or breast irradiation, or any treatment or examination that involves hands-on treatment or requires removal of clothing. Nurses should be prepared to offer support and referral to psychologists, community resources, and self-help groups.</p>

<p class="BoxUL1Middle">Assure the woman that her information is confidential, although it does become part of her medical record. <em>If children are suspected of being abused or are being abused, the law requires that this be reported to the authorities.</em> Some states require reporting of spousal or partner abuse. Domestic violence agencies and medical and nursing groups disagree with this policy and are trying to have it changed. Serious opposition is based on the fact that reporting does not and cannot currently guarantee a woman&#x2019;s safety and may place her in more danger. It may also interfere with a patient&#x2019;s willingness to discuss her personal life and concerns with health care providers. This places a serious barrier in the way of comprehensive nursing care. If nurses are in doubt about laws on reporting abuse, they need to check with their local or state domestic violence agency.</p></td>

<h6 class="h6">Health Issues in Women with Disability</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 20% of women have disability and encounter physical, architectural, and attitudinal barriers that may limit their full participation in society (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3658">Okoro, Hollis, Cyrus, et al., 2018</a>). Women with disability may experience stereotyping and increased risk of abuse, maltreatment, and neglect. They have reported that others, including health care providers, often equate them with their disability. Studies have reported that women with disability receive less primary health care and preventive health screening than other women, often because of access problems and health care providers who focus on the causes of disability rather than on health issues that are of concern to all women (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Horner-Johnson, 2019</a>; <a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Okoro et al., 2018</a>). To address these issues, the health history must include questions about barriers to health care encountered by women with disability and the effect of their disability on their health status and health care.</p>
<p class="indent">The CDC and the Association of Maternal Child Health Programs partnered to develop a central resource tool made of existing resources for nurses, physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who work with women with disability. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1649" title="1649"></span>The Toolbox provides links to existing tools to help facilitate preventive services (such as routine physical examinations, teeth cleanings, hepatitis B vaccinations, cervical cancer and breast cancer screenings, and family planning services) to women with disability (CDC, 2019b). Other issues to be addressed regarding the care of women with disability are identified in <a href="#ct50-4">Chart&#x00A0;50-4</a>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">People Who Identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As the nature of family changes in our society, so must the health care providers&#x2019; understanding of the people who make up the family unit (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Gregg, 2018</a>). Many health assessments presume a heterosexual orientation. Many health care providers are insufficiently prepared to meet the health needs of patients who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) (see <a href="c54.xhtml">Chapter 54</a>) (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Wingo, Ingraham, &#x0026; Roberts, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Those who identify themselves as LGBTQ may have concerns about disclosure and confidentiality, discriminatory attitudes, and treatment (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Gregg, 2018</a>; <a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Wingo et al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ct50-5">Chart&#x00A0;50-5</a>). Some research has reported that transgender people abuse alcohol and drugs to a greater degree than their nontransgender counterparts because their social venues may contribute to alcohol and drug use.</p>
<p class="indent">Youth who identify as LGBTQ are at higher risk of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and STIs (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Wingo et al., 2018</a>). In addition, youth who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1650" title="1650"></span>bisexual or who lack support from parents and families may experience increased physical and mental health issues (e.g., depression, obesity) as well as isolation (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3651">Lapinski, Covas, Perkins, et al., 2018</a>). Nurses need to understand the unique needs of this population and provide appropriate and sensitive care.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Health Care for Those Who Identify as LGBTQ</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses working with those who identify as LGBTQ should consider that these people:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are found in every ethnic group and socioeconomic class.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are seen in all age groups, including teens and seniors.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Can be single, celibate, or divorced.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have often encountered insensitivity in health care encounters.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are typically offered contraception when asked if they are sexually active and respond affirmatively, as health care providers may assume incorrectly that they practice heterosexual intercourse.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have lower health screening rates than other women.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Often feel invisible and underuse health care, similar to many other marginalized groups of women.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses need to:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Use gender-neutral questions and terms that are nonjudgmental and accepting.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that lesbian teens are at risk for suicide and screen for those at risk.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that many lesbians do participate in heterosexual activity but consider themselves at low risk for STIs. Because human papilloma virus, herpes infections, and other organisms implicated in STIs are transmitted by secretions and contact, lesbians may need information on STIs and contraception. If sex toys are used and not cleaned, pelvic infections can occur.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Women who identify as LGBTQ are at high risk for cancer, heart disease, depression, and alcohol abuse. They may have a higher body mass index, may bear fewer or no children, and often have fewer health preventive screenings than women who are heterosexual. These factors may increase the risk of colon, endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Adolescents are at risk for smoking and suicide/depression.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Older women function at various levels across the health spectrum; some function at a high level in their jobs or families, whereas others may be very ill. Nurses need to be prepared to care for older women who may be bright, energetic, and ambitious or who are coping with multiple family crises, including their own health issues, as well as for those who are experiencing a life-altering or life-threatening health problem. Older women are at risk for several conditions, including diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and thyroid disease, all of which have symptoms that may be dismissed as typical aging. Nurses can help prevent morbidity and mortality from these conditions by encouraging women to obtain regular health screenings (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Knowledge about heart disease prevention, pharmacology, diet, signs of dementia or cognitive decline, fall prevention, osteoporosis prevention, gynecologic and breast cancers, and sexuality are important for providing high-level nursing care. Health disparities, cultural competency, and end-of-life issues also need to be considered.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2270">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Periodic examinations and routine cancer screening are important for all women (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Bibbins-Domingo, 2017</a>). Patients need understanding and support due to the emotional and physical considerations associated with gynecologic examinations. Women may be embarrassed by the usual questions asked by a gynecologist or women&#x2019;s health care provider. Because gynecologic conditions are of a personal and private nature to most women, such information is shared only with those directly involved in patient care.</p>
<p class="indent">The approach to the gynecologic examination needs to be systematic and thorough (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The nurse can alleviate feelings of anxiety with explanations and education (see <a href="#ct50-6">Chart&#x00A0;50-6</a>). It may be helpful to emphasize that a pelvic examination should not usually be uncomfortable. Before the examination begins, the patient is asked to empty her bladder and to provide a urine specimen if urine tests are part of the assessment. Voiding ensures patient comfort and eases the examination because a full bladder can make palpation of pelvic organs uncomfortable for the patient and difficult for the examiner.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Positioning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The supine lithotomy position is used most commonly (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). If the patient chooses, alternative positions are sometimes used (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). The lithotomy position offers several advantages:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>It is more comfortable for some women.</span></li>
<li><span>It allows better eye contact between patient and examiner.</span></li>
<li><span>It may provide an easier means for the examiner to carry out the bimanual examination.</span></li>
<li><span>It enables the woman to use a mirror to see her anatomy (if she chooses) to visualize any conditions that require treatment or to learn about using certain contraceptive methods.</span></li></ul>

<p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct50-6"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;50-6</strong> <img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> <strong>PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>The Pelvic Examination</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A pelvic examination includes assessment of the appearance of the vulva, vagina, and cervix and the size and shape of the uterus and ovaries to ensure reproductive health and absence of illness. Providing education for the patient should make the examination proceed more smoothly.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Expect to have a feeling of fullness or pressure during the examination, but you should not feel pain. It is important to relax, because if you are very tense, you may feel discomfort.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that it is normal to feel uncomfortable and apprehensive.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that a narrow, warmed speculum will be inserted to visualize the cervix and a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear will be obtained, if indicated, and should not be uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Note that you may watch the examination with a mirror if you choose; the examination usually takes no longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Understand that draping will be used to minimize exposure and reduce embarrassment.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Inspection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the patient is prepared, the examiner inspects the external genitalia by looking at the labia majora and minora, noting the epidermal tissue of the labia majora; the skin fades to the pink mucous membrane of the vaginal introitus. Lesions of any type (e.g., genital warts, pigmented lesions [melanoma]) are evaluated. In the woman who is nulliparous, the labia minora come together at the opening of the vagina. In a woman who has delivered children vaginally, the labia minora may gape and vaginal tissue may protrude.</p>
<p class="indent">Trauma to the anterior vaginal wall during childbirth may have resulted in incompetency of the musculature, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cystocele:&lt;/b&gt; a bulge caused by the bladder protruding into the vagina">cystocele</button></strong> (a bulge caused by the bladder protruding into the submucosa of the anterior vaginal wall) may be seen. Childbirth trauma may also have affected the posterior vaginal wall, producing a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rectocele:&lt;/b&gt; bulging of the rectum into the vagina">rectocele</button></strong> (a bulge caused by rectal cavity protrusion). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;uterine prolapse:&lt;/b&gt; the cervix and uterus descend into the lower vagina">Uterine prolapse</button></strong>, in which the cervix and uterus descend under pressure through the vaginal canal and may be seen at the introitus, may also occur. To identify such protrusions, the examiner asks the patient to &#x201C;bear down.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">The introitus should be free of superficial mucosal lesions. The labia minora may be separated by the fingers of the gloved hand and the lower part of the vagina palpated. In women who have not had penile-vaginal intercourse, a hymen of variable thickness may be felt circumferentially within the vaginal opening. The hymenal ring usually permits the insertion of one finger. Rarely, the hymen totally occludes the vaginal entrance (imperforate hymen).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Examination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Examination techniques include the speculum examination and several palpation methods.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1650</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1651" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1651">p. 1651</span></div>
<p class="h7">Speculum Examination</p>
<p class="nonindent">The bivalve speculum, either metal or plastic, is available in many sizes (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). Metal specula are cleaned and sterilized between patients; plastic specula are for one-time use. Water-soluble lubricant or warm water is used to lubricate the speculum (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The speculum is gently inserted into the posterior portion of the introitus and slowly advanced to the top of the vagina; this should not be painful or uncomfortable for the woman. The speculum is then slowly opened. In the metal types, a setscrew of the thumb rest is tightened; in the plastic types, a clip is locked to hold the blades in place (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Inspecting the Cervix</p>
<p class="nonindent">The cervix is inspected for color, position, size, surface characteristics, discharge, and size and shape of the cervical os (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). In women who are nulliparous, the cervix usually is 2 to 3 cm wide and smooth. In women who have borne children, the cervix may have a laceration, usually transverse, giving the cervical os a &#x201C;fishmouth&#x201D; appearance. Epithelium from the endocervical canal may have grown onto the surface of the cervix, appearing as beefy-red surface epithelium circumferentially around the os. Occasionally, the cervix of a woman whose mother took diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy has a hooded appearance (a peaked aspect superiorly or a ridge of tissue surrounding it); this is evaluated by colposcopy when identified.</p>
<p class="indent">Malignant changes may not be obviously differentiated from the rest of the cervical mucosa. Small, benign cysts may appear on the cervical surface. Called <em>nabothian (retention) cysts,</em> these are usually bluish or white and are a normal finding after childbirth (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). A polyp of endocervical mucosa may protrude through the os and usually is dark red. Polyps can cause irregular bleeding; they are rarely malignant and usually are removed easily in an office or clinic setting. A carcinoma may appear as a cauliflowerlike growth (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). Bluish coloration of the cervix is a sign of early pregnancy (Chadwick sign).</p>
<p class="h7">Obtaining Pap Smears and Other Samples</p>
<p class="nonindent">A Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a screening test for abnormal cells of the cervix. Usually, a Pap test is obtained using liquid-based cytology. A cytobrush collection device is rotated in the cervical os. The nurse or provider should be sure to follow the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions to collect and preserve the specimen appropriately. The liquid sample is also used to test for the presence of HPV (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>). Immediately after the Pap smear, DNA testing for organisms or a wet mount and potassium hydroxide procedures can be completed before the speculum is removed (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A specimen of any purulent material appearing at the cervical os is obtained for culture. A sterile applicator is used to obtain the specimen, which is immediately placed in an appropriate medium for transfer to a laboratory. In a patient who has a high risk for infection, routine cultures for gonococcal and chlamydial organisms are recommended because of the high incidence of both diseases and the complications of pelvic infection, fallopian tube damage, and subsequent infertility (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Vaginal discharge, which may be normal or may result from vaginitis, may be present. <a href="#tt50-3">Table&#x00A0;50-3</a> summarizes the characteristics of vaginal discharge found in different conditions.</p>
<p class="h7">Inspecting the Vagina</p>
<p class="nonindent">The vagina is inspected as the examiner withdraws the speculum. It is smooth in young girls and thickens after puberty, with many rugae (folds) and redundancy in the epithelium. In women who are menopausal, the vagina thins and has fewer rugae because of decreased estrogen.</p>
<p class="h7">Bimanual Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent">To complete the pelvic examination, the examiner performs a bimanual examination. The examiner should inform the woman that she will be examined internally with the examiners&#x2019; fingers. The gloved fingers are then advanced vertically along the vaginal canal, and the vaginal wall is palpated. Any firm part of the vaginal wall may represent old scar tissue from childbirth trauma but may also require further evaluation (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Ball et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Cervical Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent">The cervix is palpated and assessed for its consistency, mobility, size, and position. The normal cervix is uniformly firm but not hard. Softening of the cervix is a finding in early pregnancy. Hardness and immobility of the cervix may reflect invasion by a neoplasm. Pain on gentle movement of the cervix is called a <em>positive chandelier sign</em> (positive cervical motion tenderness; recorded as + CMT) and usually indicates a pelvic infection.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1651</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1652" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1652">p. 1652</span></div>
<p class="h7">Uterine Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent">To palpate the uterus, the examiner places the opposite hand on the abdominal wall halfway between the umbilicus and the pubis and presses firmly toward the vagina. Movement of the abdominal wall causes the body of the uterus to descend, and the organ becomes freely movable between the hand used to examine the abdomen and the fingers of the hand used to examine the pelvis. Uterine size, mobility, and contour can be estimated through palpation. Fixation of the uterus in the pelvis may be a sign of endometriosis or malignancy.</p>
<p class="indent">The body of the uterus is normally twice the diameter and twice the length of the cervix, curving anteriorly toward the abdominal wall. Some women have a retroverted or retroflexed uterus, which tips posteriorly toward the sacrum, whereas others have a uterus that is neither anterior nor posterior and is described as midline.</p>
<p class="h7">Adnexal Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent">The right and left adnexal areas are palpated to evaluate the fallopian tubes and ovaries. The fingers of the hand examining the pelvis are moved first to one side, then to the other, while the hand palpating the abdominal area is moved correspondingly to either side of the abdomen and downward. The adnexa (ovaries and fallopian tubes) are trapped between the two hands and palpated for an obvious mass, tenderness, and mobility. Commonly, the ovaries are slightly tender, and the patient is informed that slight discomfort on palpation is normal.</p>
<p class="h7">Vaginal and Rectal Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Bimanual palpation of the vagina and cul-de-sac is accomplished by placing the index finger in the vagina and the middle finger in the rectum. To prevent cross-contamination between the vaginal and rectal orifices, the examiner puts on new gloves. A gentle movement of these fingers toward each other compresses the posterior vaginal wall and the anterior rectal wall and assists the examiner in identifying the integrity of these structures. During this procedure, the patient may sense an urge to defecate. The nurse assures the patient that this is unlikely to occur. Ongoing explanations are provided to reassure and educate the patient about the procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Yearly examinations aid early identification of reproductive system disorders in aging women (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Nurses play an important role in encouraging all women to have an annual gynecologic examination. Women older than 65 years may stop cervical cancer screening if they have had a hysterectomy or have had three normal cytology tests and no abnormal test in the past 10 years (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Perineal pruritus is abnormal in older women and should be evaluated because it may indicate a disease process (diabetes or malignancy). Vulvar dystrophy (a thickened or whitish discoloration of tissue) may be visible, and biopsy is needed to rule out abnormal cells. Topical cortisone and hormone creams may be prescribed for symptomatic relief.</p>
<p class="indent">With relaxing pelvic musculature, uterine prolapse and relaxation of the vaginal walls can occur (<a href="c50-sec15.xhtml#bib3684">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Appropriate evaluation and surgical repair can relieve the discomfort and pressure of the prolapse if the patient is a candidate for surgery. The patient should be informed that tissue repair and healing after surgery may require more time with aging. A pessary (rubber or plastic device that provides support) is often used before surgery to see if surgery can be avoided. It is fitted by a gynecologic health care provider and may reduce the patient&#x2019;s discomfort and pressure. Pessaries also are used if surgery is contraindicated. The use of a pessary requires the patient to have routine gynecologic examinations to monitor for irritation or infection. The patient must be assessed for allergy prior to insertion of a latex pessary. See <a href="c51.xhtml">Chapter 51</a>, <a href="c51-sec13.xhtml#ff51-4">Figure&#x00A0;51-4</a>, for details about pessaries.</p>
