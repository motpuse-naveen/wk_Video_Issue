<h4 class="h4" id="s99">Genetic and Genomic Technologies in Practice</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic tests are used to detect a trait, to diagnose a genetic condition, or to identify people who have a genetic predisposition to a particular disease or condition. A plethora of genetic tests are available; some may be purchased directly by the consumer. The Genetic Testing Registry recognizes genetic tests for almost 12,000 genetic conditions (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI], NLM, 2019a). Advances in the application of genetic testing are noted in pharmacogenetics, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, newborn screening, direct-to-consumer testing, and prenatal screening. Forms of genetic testing or genetic screening are available across the lifespan, extending from preimplantation genetic screening during pregnancy to posthumous testing (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib359">Bilkey, Burns, Coles, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Future applications may include the use of gene chips to map a person&#x2019;s individual genome for genetic variations that may lead to disease. Nurses are involved in caring for patients who are undergoing genetic testing and gene-based treatments. Knowledge of the clinical applications of modern genetic and genomic technologies enables nurses to inform and to support patients and their family members, and to provide high-quality genetic-related health care.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s100">Genetic Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic testing is the primary tool used to identify individuals who are predisposed to specific genetic diseases. Genetic tests provide information leading to the diagnosis of inherited conditions or other conditions with a known genetic contribution.</p>
<p class="indent">Approaches to genetic testing may focus on genotype or phenotype. Genotypic methods involve analysis of the chromosomes and genes directly, using specific laboratory techniques to learn whether a genetic alteration related to a specific disease or condition is present. This testing may be DNA based, chromosomal, or biochemical. Awareness of molecular biomarkers that can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of genetic-related tests allows for early detection of genetic illness, and for researchers to understand genetic pathways that may be useful in the treatment of specific disorders (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib423">van Lanschot, Bosch, de Wit, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Phenotypic methods examine the familial or biologic presentation of disease and include assessment of the patient&#x2019;s personal or family history and medical factors influencing their disease as well as testing for gene products such as protein markers in body fluids or diseased tissues. The family history, which is considered the first genetic test, is discussed later in this chapter (see the Family History Assessment section). It is expected that all nurses are able to create and interpret a three-generation family pedigree (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another phenotypic approach involves searching for gene products, such as proteins and enzymes that can clinically indicate a genetic abnormality. For example, germline mutations in the repair genes <em>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,</em> and <em>PMS2</em> are responsible for hereditary early-onset colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome. Colorectal tumors are now tested to measure the presence or absence of these proteins using immunohistochemistry, which is a routine type of pathology test. Specific colon cancer gene mutations are used to identify other genetic forms of colon cancer which increases the likelihood of cancer in other areas of the body. These include not only Lynch syndrome, but also familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Peutz&#x2013;Jeghers, Cowden syndrome, and juvenile polyposis syndrome (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Edwards &#x0026; Maradiegue, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Genetic testing can be used for various purposes in prenatal, pediatric, and adult populations. Prenatal testing is widely used for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;prenatal screening:&lt;/b&gt; testing that is used to identify whether a fetus is at risk for a birth defect (e.g., Down syndrome or spina bifida)">prenatal screening</button></strong> and diagnosis of conditions such as Down syndrome. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;preimplantation genetic testing:&lt;/b&gt; a testing procedure used to identify genetic alterations in embryos">Preimplantation genetic testing</button></strong><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems"></button></strong>, a form of prenatal genetic testing, detects the presence of genetic abnormalities in embryos (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib410">Parikh, Athalye, Naik, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Carrier testing is used to determine if a person carries a recessive allele for an inherited condition (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Tay-Sachs disease) and, therefore, risks passing it on to his or her children. Genetic testing is also used widely in newborn screening. Newborn testing is performed on infants to identify conditions, such as PKU, in which interventions can be implemented to prevent severe outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Diagnostic testing is used to detect the presence or absence of a particular genetic alteration or allele to identify or confirm a diagnosis of a disease or condition (e.g., myotonic dystrophy, fragile X syndrome) (<a href="#ct6-2">Chart&#x00A0;6-2</a>). Increasingly, genetic tests are being used to predict drug response and to design specific and individualized treatment plans or personalized medicine. For example, genetic testing is used to identify specific gene variants that can predict the effectiveness of treatments of human immunodeficiency virus infection, atherothrombosis, thrombophilia, hyperlipidemia, breast cancer, pain management, hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, depression, and bipolar disorder (NCBI, NLM, 2019b).

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Can Predictive Genetic Testing Threaten Patient Autonomy?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">M.T., a high school biology teacher, brings her 11-year-old daughter to the family practice clinic where you are employed as the nurse manager. M.T. insists that she wants her daughter to have predictive genetic testing (PGT) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disorder associated with aggressive colorectal cancer that typically evidences pathology during young adulthood. M.T. tells you that her husband&#x2019;s sister, who is 36 years old, was recently diagnosed with FAP and advanced colorectal cancer. She also tells you that she recently discovered that her husband&#x2019;s father and his father&#x2019;s only sibling both died of colorectal cancer before they were 50. Her husband is 34 years old; according to M.T., he has not been seen by a health care provider since he was a teenager and refuses to do so or to be tested for FAP.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">There are many legal and ethical concerns raised by health care providers regarding PGT in children. Some genetic disorders are not amenable to treatment during childhood (e.g., carrying a <em>BRCA</em> genetic mutation, which is associated with various cancers in adulthood). In these instances, it is generally advisable to forego offering PGT to a child until such time that the child reaches adulthood and is able to make the autonomous decision to either be tested or not be tested. The American College of Medical Genetics contends that ultimately, the best interest of the person tested must be the focus of PGT.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">In this particular case, it is presumed that the father has not consented to be tested for the FAP genetic mutation. However, should he consent to testing and find out that he does not have the genetic mutation associated with FAP, then the daughter could not have that mutated gene, since it is conferred through autosomal dominant inheritance. By contrast, if the father does carry the gene for FAP, then the daughter would have a 50% chance of having the gene; moreover, if she has the gene, she and her parents should be advised that she should begin screening colonoscopies. Precancerous colonic polyps can be found and excised before they become malignant in children with FAP, which can be a lifesaving treatment.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>). Which principle do you believe should have preeminence in deciding whether or not parents have the right to have PGT done for a child?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>In this case, do the benefits outweigh the risks of PGT for a child? Would your viewpoint on PGT be different if the child assented to be tested? What if she tells you that she would rather not be tested and wants to follow her father&#x2019;s example?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the stakeholders in this case. Does the father have the right to forego being tested for the genetic mutation? What if the daughter has PGT performed despite the father&#x2019;s refusal to be tested, and it is found that she has the genetic mutation? In that case, the father must also have the genetic mutation. Does he have the right to be told or to not be told these results and their implications?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are there any professional guidelines that you can turn to for help in determining the ethical issues that revolve around PGT? If so, what are they, and how can they help?</p>

<p class="indent">Nurses are increasingly involved in taking family histories and educating the patient about aspects of genetic testing. They contribute by ensuring informed health choices and consent, advocating for privacy and confidentiality with regard to genetic test results, assessing genetic risk, and helping patients understand the complex issues involved (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Edwards &#x0026; Maradiegue, 2018</a>). The rapid uptake of direct-to-consumer genetic testing mandates that nurses educate patients about the pros and cons of the selected type of genetic testing, navigate the psychosocial needs of patients and their families, and make referrals to genetic specialists as indicated (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Mahon, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s101">Genetic Screening</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic screening, in contrast to genetic testing, is performed independent of having a positive family history or symptom manifestation based on a personal risk or based on the person having a risk associated with a specific population or group of people that they belong to. There are multiple forms of genetic screening which are useful at different points across the lifespan. Most commonly, genetic screening occurs in prenatal and newborn programs. For example, shortly after birth, newborns are screened for a variety of conditions, including PKU, congenital hypothyroidism, and galactosemia as a means to identify treatable genetic conditions that could prove dangerous to their health if left untreated. Prenatal genetic screening is provided as a reproductive option to people with a high probability of having children with severe, untreatable diseases and for whom genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and other reproductive options could be helpful. Genetic screening of pregnant women is used to detect birth defects such as neural tube defects and Down syndrome. Cascade screening is a cost-effective strategy to identify those at risk for genetic illness based on the identification of another family member with the disorder (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib417">Silva, Jannes, Oliveira, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). This form of genetic screening is most useful for autosomal dominant disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia or Lynch syndrome. The results of genetic screening may also be used for public health purposes to determine the incidence and prevalence of a birth defect or to investigate the feasibility and value of new genetic testing methods. <a href="#tt6-4">Table&#x00A0;6-4</a> gives examples of types of genetic screening.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s102">Population Screening</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Population screening&#x2014;the use of genetic testing for large groups or entire populations&#x2014;to identify late-onset conditions is under development. For a test to be considered for population screening, there must be (1) sufficient information about gene distribution within populations, (2) accurate prediction about the development and progression of disease, and (3) appropriate medical management for asymptomatic people with a mutation. Currently, population screening is considered in some ethnic groups to identify cancer-predisposing genes. For example, individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry have a greater chance of inheriting breast and ovarian cancer than other ethnic groups (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Manchanda &#x0026; Gaba, 2019</a>). The identification of one of these mutations gives patients options that may include cancer screening, chemoprevention, or prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy. In addition, population screening for this group could also include screening for conditions such as Tay-Sachs disease and Canavan disease. Population screening is being explored for other adult-onset conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hereditary hemochromatosis (i.e., iron overload disorder). In some countries, there is a push to conduct population screening as a form of precision medicine focused on prevention (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib417">Silva et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Turnball, Sud, &#x0026; Houlston, 2019</a>).</p>
