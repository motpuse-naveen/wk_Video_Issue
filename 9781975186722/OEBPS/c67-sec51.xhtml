<h4 class="h4" id="s3273">Patients Who Are Suicidal</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Attempted suicide is an act that stems from depression (e.g., loss of a loved one, loss of body integrity or status, poor self-image) and can be viewed as a cry for help and intervention. Males are at greater risk of successfully committing suicide than females, who attempt suicide more often (ENA, 2020a). Others at risk are older adults; young adults; people who are enduring unusual loss or stress; those who are unemployed, divorced, widowed, or living alone; those showing signs of significant depression (e.g., weight loss, sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, suicidal preoccupation); and those with a history of a previous suicide attempt, suicide in the family, or psychiatric illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Being aware of people at risk and assessing for specific factors that predispose a person to suicide are key management strategies. Specific signs and symptoms of potential suicide include the following:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Communication of suicidal intent<em>,</em> such as preoccupation with death or speaking of someone else&#x2019;s suicide (e.g., &#x201C;I&#x2019;m tired of living.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve put my affairs in order.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m better off dead.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a burden to my family.&#x201D;)</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>History of a previous suicide attempt, with risk being much greater in these cases</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Family history of suicide</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Loss of a parent at an early age</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Specific plan for suicide</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>A means to carry out the plan</p>
<p class="indent">Emergency management focuses on treating the consequences of the suicide attempt (e.g., gunshot wound, drug overdose) and preventing further self-injury. A patient who has made a suicidal attempt may do so again. Crisis intervention is used to determine suicidal potential, to discover areas of depression and conflict, to find out about the patient&#x2019;s support system, and to determine whether hospitalization or psychiatric referral is necessary. Depending on the patient&#x2019;s potential for suicide, the patient may be admitted to the intensive care unit, referred for follow-up care, or admitted to the psychiatric unit.</p>

<div class="casestudyb">
<p class="figimg"><img src="images/2215-1.png" alt="img"/></p>
<p class="CASEMSTUDYptype03pPARApIndent">Recall from <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a> <span class="bl">Carl Shapiro</span>, who was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia during a routine visit to his primary provider. He arrives in the ED with a blood pressure of 210/110. The nurse discovers that he stopped his antihypertensive medication due to erectile dysfunction. How does the nurse maintain patient privacy in the ED during discussion of personal issues? What topics should be included in an individualized discharge plan to address his concerns, educational needs, and continuity of care when the nurse receives orders for an ACE inhibitor, captopril, and discharge home?</p>
<p class="CASEMSTUDYptype03pPARApIndent">Care for Carl and other patients in a realistic virtual environment: <img class="m" src="images/vsim.png" alt=""/>(<strong><a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/vSimMedicalSurgical">thepoint.lww.com/vSimMedicalSurgical</a></strong>).

<p class="reviewpH1">CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES</p>
<div class="review">
<p class="reviewpNL1First"><span class="sblue">1</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon18ebp.png" alt=""/> A 48-year-old male arrived in the ED via ambulance. EMS personnel report that the patient was fishing when his boat overturned in a lake. He was in the water for at least 15 minutes before someone was able to get to him. The patient was initially unresponsive but was resuscitated by EMS en route to the hospital. His current body temperature is 34&#x00B0;C (93&#x00B0;F). What evidence-based interventions, including methods of rewarming, are indicated? What additional supportive care will be required? Explain the rationale and levels of support for these methods of treatment.</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">2</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon09aipc.png" alt=""/> A 19-year-old female college student arrives in the ED accompanied by her friend. She had just been at a party and states an acquaintance she knew forced her to have intercourse against her will. She is tearful and shaking and she appears to have some visible bruising. What priority nursing actions should be taken? What resources will need to be utilized in her care? Who should be consulted for the patient and what type of consent must she provide? Detail the steps that will be taken as you begin to care for this patient. What follow-up care will this patient need?</p>
<p class="reviewline"></p>
<p class="reviewpNL1Middle"><span class="sblue">3</span> <img class="m" src="images/icon09cte.png" alt=""/> A 32-year-old female was brought to the ED by her fianc&#x00E9;. He states he had been working on a faulty hot water heater in the basement most of the day; when he came upstairs, the patient voiced complaints of a headache that had begun about 2 hours ago. He brought her to the ED when she began to complain of dizziness, palpitations, and she seemed to become increasingly confused. What questions would you include in your assessment? Explain the management of this patient and additional care that would be required. What concerns would you have for her fianc&#x00E9;?</p>
