<h4 class="h4" id="s1057">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The hematologic system consists of the blood and the sites where blood is produced, including the bone marrow and the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Blood is a specialized organ that differs from other organs in that it exists in a fluid state. Blood is composed of plasma and various types of cells which account for 7% to 9% of total blood volume (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Jouria, 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;plasma:&lt;/b&gt; liquid portion of blood">Plasma</button></strong> is the fluid portion of blood; it contains various proteins, such as albumin, globulin, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fibrinogen:&lt;/b&gt; protein converted into fibrin to form thrombus and clot">fibrinogen</button></strong>, and other factors necessary for clotting, as well as electrolytes, waste products, and nutrients. About 55% of whole blood volume is plasma (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2043">American Society of Hematology, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1058">Bone Marrow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The bone marrow is the site of hematopoiesis, or blood cell formation. In adults, blood cell formation is usually limited to the pelvis, ribs, vertebrae, and sternum. Marrow is one of the largest organs of the body, making up 4% to 5% of total body weight. It consists of islands of cellular components (red marrow) separated by fat (yellow marrow). As people age, the proportion of active marrow is gradually replaced by fat; however, in healthy adults, the fat can again be replaced by active marrow when more blood cell production is required. In adults with disease that causes marrow destruction, fibrosis, or scarring, the liver and spleen can also resume production of blood cells by a process known as extramedullary hematopoiesis.</p>
<p class="indent">The marrow is vascular. Within it are primitive cells called <strong>stem cells</strong>. The stem cells have the ability to self-replicate, thereby ensuring a continuous supply of stem cells throughout the life cycle. When stimulated to do so, stem cells can begin a process called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;differentiation:&lt;/b&gt; development of functions and characteristics that are different from those of the parent stem cell">differentiation</button></strong>, and develop into either <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myeloid:&lt;/b&gt; pertaining to nonlymphoid blood cells that differentiate into RBCs, platelets, macrophages, mast cells, and various WBCs">myeloid</button></strong> or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lymphoid:&lt;/b&gt; pertaining to lymphocytes">lymphoid</button></strong> stem cells (see <a href="#ff28-1">Fig. 28-1</a>). These stem cells are committed to produce specific types of blood cells. Lymphoid stem cells produce either T or B <strong>lymphocytes</strong>, cells that have specific immune functions that will be described in more detail later. Myeloid stem cells differentiate into three broad cell types: erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Thus, with the exception of lymphocytes, all blood cells are derived from myeloid stem cells. A defect in a myeloid stem cell can cause problems with erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet production. In contrast, a defect in the lymphoid stem cell can cause problems with T or B lymphocytes, plasma cells (a more differentiated form of B lymphocyte), or natural killer (NK) (see <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> for additional information) (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Wimberly, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stroma:&lt;/b&gt; component of the bone marrow not directly related to hematopoiesis but serves important supportive roles in this process">stroma</button></strong> of the marrow refers to all tissue within the marrow that is not directly involved in hematopoiesis. However, the stroma is important in an indirect manner, in that it produces the colony-stimulating factors needed for hematopoiesis. The yellow marrow is the largest component of the stroma. Other cells comprising the stroma include fibroblasts (reticular connective tissue), osteoclasts, osteoblasts (both needed for remodeling of skeletal bone), and endothelial cells.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1059">Blood</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The cellular component of blood consists of three primary cell types (see <a href="#tt28-1">Table 28-1</a>): <strong>erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs], red cells), leukocytes (white blood cells [WBCs]</strong>), and <strong>thrombocytes (platelets)</strong>. These cellular components of blood normally make up 40% to 45% of the blood volume (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2043">American Society of Hematology, 2020</a>). Because most blood cells have a short lifespan, the need for the body to replenish its supply of cells is continuous; this process is termed <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hematopoiesis:&lt;/b&gt; complex process of the formation and maturation of blood cells">hematopoiesis</button></strong>. The primary site for hematopoiesis is the bone marrow. During embryonic development and in other conditions, the liver and spleen may also be involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Under normal conditions, the adult bone marrow produces about 175 billion erythrocytes, 70 billion <strong>neutrophils</strong> (a mature type of WBC), and 175 billion platelets each day. When the body needs more blood cells, as in infection (when neutrophils are needed to fight the invading pathogen) or in bleeding (when more RBCs are required), the marrow increases its production of the cells required. Thus, under normal conditions, the marrow responds to increased demand and releases adequate numbers of cells into the circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Blood makes up approximately 7% to 9% of the normal body weight and amounts to 5 to 6 L of volume for men and 4 to 5 L of volume for women (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Nair, 2017</a>). Circulating through the vascular system and serving as a link between body organs, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page886" title="886"></span>blood carries oxygen absorbed from the lungs and nutrients absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the body cells for cellular metabolism. Blood also carries hormones, antibodies, and other substances to their sites of action or use. In addition, blood carries waste products produced by cellular metabolism to the lungs, skin, liver, and kidneys, where they are transformed and eliminated from the body.</p>

Uncommitted (pluripotent) stem cells can differentiate into myeloid or lymphoid stem cells. These stem cells then undergo a complex process of differentiation and maturation into normal cells that are released into the circulation. The myeloid stem cell is responsible not only for all nonlymphoid white blood cells but also for the production of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Each step of the differentiation process depends in part on the presence of specific growth factors for each cell type. When the stem cells are dysfunctional, they may respond inadequately to the need for more cells, or they may respond excessively, and sometimes uncontrollably, as in leukemia.

<p class="indent">The danger that trauma can lead to excess blood loss always exists. To prevent this, an intricate clotting mechanism is activated when necessary to seal any leak in the blood vessels. Excessive clotting is equally dangerous, because it can obstruct blood flow to vital tissues. To prevent this, the body has a fibrinolytic mechanism that eventually dissolves clots (thrombi) formed within blood vessels. The balance between these two systems&#x2014;clot (thrombus) formation and clot dissolution or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fibrinolysis:&lt;/b&gt; process of breakdown of fibrin clot">fibrinolysis</button></strong>&#x2014;is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemostasis:&lt;/b&gt; intricate balance between clot formation and clot dissolution">hemostasis</button></strong>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The normal erythrocyte is a biconcave disc that resembles a soft ball compressed between two fingers (see <a href="#ff28-2">Fig. 28-2</a>). It has a diameter of about 8 <sup>&#x03BC;</sup>m and is so flexible that it can pass easily through capillaries that may be as small as 2.8 <sup>&#x03BC;</sup>m in diameter. The membrane of the red cell is very thin so that gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, can easily diffuse across it; the disc shape provides a large surface area that facilitates the absorption and release of oxygen molecules.</p>
<p class="indent">Mature erythrocytes consist primarily of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemoglobin:&lt;/b&gt; iron-containing protein of RBCs; delivers oxygen to tissues">hemoglobin</button></strong>, which contains iron and protein and makes up 95% of the cell mass. Mature erythrocytes have no nuclei, and they have many fewer metabolic enzymes than do most other cells. The presence of a large amount of hemoglobin enables the red cell to perform its principal function, which is the transport of oxygen between the lungs and tissues. Occasionally, the marrow releases slightly immature forms of erythrocytes, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;reticulocytes:&lt;/b&gt; slightly immature RBCs, usually only 1% of total circulating RBCs">reticulocytes</button></strong>, into the circulation. This occurs as a normal response to an increased demand for erythrocytes (as in bleeding) or in some disease states.</p>
<p class="indent">The oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecule is made up of four subunits, each containing a heme portion attached to a globin chain. Iron is present in the heme component of the molecule. An important property of heme is its ability to bind to oxygen loosely and reversibly. Oxygen readily binds to hemoglobin in the lungs and is carried as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;oxyhemoglobin:&lt;/b&gt; combined form of oxygen and hemoglobin; primarily found in arterial blood">oxyhemoglobin</button></strong> in arterial blood. Oxyhemoglobin is a brighter red than hemoglobin that does not contain oxygen (reduced hemoglobin); thus, arterial blood is a brighter red than venous blood. The oxygen readily dissociates (detaches) from hemoglobin in the tissues, where the oxygen is needed for cellular metabolism. In venous blood, hemoglobin combines with hydrogen ions produced by cellular metabolism and thus buffers excessive acid. Whole blood normally contains about 15 g of hemoglobin per 100 mL of blood (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Erythropoiesis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Erythroblasts arise from the primitive myeloid stem cells in bone marrow. The erythroblast is an immature nucleated cell that gradually loses its nucleus. At this stage, the cell is known as a reticulocyte. Further maturation into an erythrocyte entails the loss of the dark-staining material within the cell and slight shrinkage. The mature erythrocyte is then released into the circulation. Under conditions of rapid <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythropoiesis:&lt;/b&gt; process of the formation of RBCs">erythropoiesis</button></strong> (i.e., erythrocyte production), reticulocytes and other immature cells may be released prematurely into the circulation. This is often seen when the liver or spleen takes over as the site of erythropoiesis and more nucleated red cells appear within the circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Differentiation of the primitive myeloid stem cell into an erythroblast is stimulated by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythropoietin:&lt;/b&gt; hormone produced primarily by the kidney; necessary for erythropoiesis">erythropoietin</button></strong>, a hormone produced primarily by the kidney. If the kidney detects low levels of oxygen, as occurs when fewer red cells are available to bind oxygen (i.e., <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anemia:&lt;/b&gt; decreased red blood cell (RBC) count">anemia</button></strong>), or with people living at high altitudes with lower atmospheric oxygen concentrations, erythropoietin levels increase. The increased erythropoietin then stimulates the marrow to increase the production of erythrocytes. The entire process of erythropoiesis occurs over 1 week (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Wimberly, 2019</a>). For normal erythrocyte production, the bone marrow also requires iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folate, pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>), protein, and other factors. A deficiency of these factors during erythropoiesis can result in decreased red cell production and anemia.</p>
<p class="h8">Iron Stores and Metabolism</p>
<p class="nonindent">The rate of iron absorption is regulated by the amount of iron already stored in the body and by the rate of erythrocyte production. Daily dietary iron requirements vary based on age, gender, and health status. For example, pregnant women require up to 30 mg of iron daily, while adult men require up <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page888" title="888"></span>to 12 mg and children up to 10 mg of iron daily (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Trevithick, 2019</a>). Additional amounts of iron, up to 2 mg daily, must be absorbed by women of childbearing age to replace that lost during menstruation. Total body iron content in the average adult is approximately 3 g, most of which is present in hemoglobin or in one of its breakdown products. Iron is stored as ferritin and when required, the iron is released into the plasma, binds to transferrin, and is transported into the membranes of the normoblasts (erythrocyte precursor cells) within the marrow, where it is incorporated into hemoglobin. Iron is lost in the feces, either in bile, blood, or mucosal cells from the intestine.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The normal findings for concentration of iron in blood can range from 50 to 250 &#x00B5;g/dL depending on age and gender (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). With iron deficiency, bone marrow iron stores are rapidly depleted; hemoglobin synthesis is depressed, and the erythrocytes produced by the marrow are small and low in hemoglobin. Iron deficiency in the adult generally indicates blood loss (e.g., from bleeding in the GI tract or heavy menstrual flow). Lack of dietary iron is rarely the sole cause of iron deficiency anemia in adults. The source of iron deficiency should be investigated promptly, because iron deficiency in an adult may be a sign of bleeding in the GI tract or colon cancer.</p>
<p class="h8">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and Folate Metabolism</p>
<p class="nonindent">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate are required for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in RBCs. Both vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate are derived from the diet. Folate is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, but only small amounts are stored within the body. If the diet is deficient in folate, stores within the body quickly become depleted. Because vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is found only in foods of animal origin, strict vegetarians may ingest little vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> combines with intrinsic factor produced in the stomach. The vitamin B<sub>12</sub>&#x2013;intrinsic factor complex is absorbed in the distal ileum. People who have had a partial or total gastrectomy may have limited amounts of intrinsic factor, and therefore the absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may be diminished. The effects of either decreased absorption or decreased intake of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are not apparent for 2 to 4 years.</p>
<p class="indent">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate deficiencies are characterized by the production of abnormally large erythrocytes called <em>megaloblasts.</em> Because these cells are abnormal, many are sequestered (trapped) while still in the bone marrow, and their rate of release is decreased. Some of these cells actually die in the marrow before they can be released into the circulation. This results in megaloblastic anemia.</p>
<p class="h7">Red Blood Cell Destruction</p>
<p class="nonindent">The average lifespan of a normal circulating erythrocyte is 120 days. Often, older erythrocytes lose elasticity and become trapped in small blood vessels and the spleen. These older erythrocytes are removed from the blood by the reticuloendothelial cells, particularly in the liver and the spleen. As the erythrocytes are destroyed, most of their hemoglobin is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page889" title="889"></span>recycled. Some hemoglobin also breaks down to form bilirubin and is secreted in the bile. Most of the iron is recycled to form new hemoglobin molecules within the bone marrow; small amounts are lost daily in the feces and urine and monthly in menstrual flow.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Leukocytes (White Blood Cells)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Leukocytes are divided into two general categories: granulocytes and lymphocytes. In normal blood, the total leukocyte count is 4000 to 11,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Of these, approximately 60% to 80% are granulocytes and 20% to 40% are lymphocytes. Both of these types of leukocytes primarily protect the body against infection and tissue injury.</p>
<p class="h7">Granulocytes</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Granulocytes</strong> are defined by the presence of granules in the cytoplasm of the cell. Granulocytes are divided into three main subgroups&#x2014;eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils&#x2014;that are characterized by the staining properties of these granules (see <a href="#ff28-2">Fig. 28-2</a>). Eosinophils have bright-red granules in their cytoplasm, whereas the granules in basophils stain deep blue. The third and most numerous cell in this class is the neutrophil, with granules that stain a pink to violet hue. Neutrophils are also called <em>polymorphonuclear neutrophils</em> (PMNs, or polys) or <em>segmented neutrophils</em> (segs).</p>
<p class="indent">The nucleus of the mature neutrophil has multiple lobes (usually two to five) that are connected by thin filaments of nuclear material, or a &#x201C;segmented&#x201D; nucleus; it is usually two times the size of an erythrocyte. The somewhat less mature granulocyte has a single-lobed, elongated nucleus and is called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;band cell:&lt;/b&gt; slightly immature neutrophil">band cell</button></strong>. Ordinarily, band cells account for only a small percentage of circulating granulocytes, although their percentage can increase greatly under conditions in which neutrophil production increases, such as infection. The increased number of band cells is sometimes called a left shift or shift to the left. (Traditionally, the diagram of neutrophil maturation showed the myeloid stem cell on the left with progressive maturation stages toward the right, ending with a fully mature neutrophil on the far right side. A shift to the left indicates that more immature cells are present in the blood than normal.)</p>
<p class="indent">Fully mature neutrophils result from the gradual differentiation of myeloid stem cells, specifically myeloid <strong>blast cells</strong> (i.e., immature white blood cells). The process, called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;myelopoiesis:&lt;/b&gt; formation and maturation of cells derived from myeloid stem cell">myelopoiesis</button></strong>, is highly complex and depends on many factors. These factors, including specific <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytokines:&lt;/b&gt; messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)">cytokines</button></strong> (i.e., regulatory proteins produced by leukocytes) such as growth factors, are normally present within the marrow itself. As the blast cell matures, the cytoplasm of the cell changes in color (from blue to violet) and granules begin to form with the cytoplasm. The shape of the nucleus also changes. The entire process of maturation and differentiation takes about 10 days (see <a href="#ff28-1">Fig. 28-1</a>). Once the neutrophil is released into the circulation from the marrow, it stays there for only about 6 hours before it migrates into the body tissues to perform its function of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;phagocytosis:&lt;/b&gt; process of cellular ingestion and digestion of foreign bodies">phagocytosis</button></strong> (ingestion and digestion of foreign bodies, such as bacteria). Neutrophils die here within 1 to 2 days. The number of circulating granulocytes found in the healthy person is relatively constant; however, in infection, large numbers of these cells are rapidly released into the circulation.</p>
<p class="h7">Agranulocytes</p>
<p class="h8">Monocytes</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Monocytes</strong> (also called <em>mononuclear leukocytes</em>) are leukocytes with a single-lobed nucleus and a granule-free cytoplasm&#x2014;hence the term <em>agranulocyte</em> (see <a href="#ff28-2">Fig. 28-2</a>). In normal adult blood, monocytes account for approximately 5% of the total leukocytes. Monocytes are the largest of the leukocytes. Produced by the bone marrow, they remain in the circulation for a short time before entering the tissues and transforming into <strong>macrophages</strong>. Macrophages are particularly active in the spleen, liver, peritoneum, and alveoli; they remove debris from these areas and phagocytize bacteria within the tissues.</p>
<p class="h8">Lymphocytes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Mature <strong>lymphocytes</strong> are small cells with scanty cytoplasm (see <a href="#ff28-2">Fig. 28-2</a>). Immature lymphocytes are produced in the marrow from the lymphoid stem cells. A second major source of production for lymphocytes is the thymus. Cells derived from the thymus are known as T lymphocytes (or T cells); those derived from the marrow can also be T cells but are more commonly B lymphocytes (or B cells). Lymphocytes complete their differentiation and maturation primarily in the lymph nodes and in the lymphoid tissue of the intestine and spleen after exposure to a specific antigen. Mature lymphocytes are the principal cells of the immune system, producing antibodies and identifying other cells and organisms as &#x201C;foreign.&#x201D; <strong>Natural killer (NK) cells</strong> serve an important role in the body&#x2019;s immune defense system. Like other lymphocytes, NK cells accumulate in the lymphoid tissues (especially spleen, lymph nodes, and tonsils), where they mature. When activated, they serve as potent killers of virus-infected and cancer cells. They also secrete cytokines to mobilize the T and B cells into action.</p>
<p class="h7">Function of Leukocytes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Leukocytes protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other foreign entities. The major function of neutrophils is phagocytosis. Neutrophils arrive at a given site within 1 hour after the onset of an inflammatory reaction and initiate phagocytosis, but they are short-lived. An influx of monocytes follows; these cells continue their phagocytic activities for long periods as macrophages. This process constitutes a second line of defense for the body against inflammation and infection. Although neutrophils can often work adequately against bacteria without the help of macrophages, macrophages are particularly effective against fungi and viruses. Macrophages also digest senescent (aging or aged) blood cells, primarily within the spleen.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary function of lymphocytes is to attack foreign material. One group of lymphocytes (T lymphocytes) kills foreign cells directly or releases lymphokines, substances that enhance the activity of phagocytic cells. T lymphocytes are responsible for delayed allergic reactions, rejection of foreign tissue (e.g., transplanted organs), and destruction of tumor cells. This process is known as <em>cellular immunity.</em> The other group of lymphocytes (B lymphocytes) is capable of differentiating into plasma cells. Plasma cells, in turn, produce antibodies called <em>immunoglobulins</em> (Igs), which are protein molecules that destroy foreign material by several mechanisms. This process is known as humoral immunity.</p>

<p class="indent">Eosinophils and basophils function in hypersensitivity reactions. Eosinophils are important in the phagocytosis of parasites. The increase in eosinophil levels in allergic states indicates that these cells are involved in the hypersensitivity reaction; they neutralize histamine. Basophils produce and store histamine as well as other substances involved in hypersensitivity reactions. The release of these substances provokes allergic reactions. See <a href="c31.xhtml">Chapter 31</a> for further information on the immune response.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Platelets (Thrombocytes)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Platelets, or thrombocytes, are not technically cells; rather, they are granular fragments of giant cells in the bone marrow called <em>megakaryocytes</em> (see <a href="#ff28-2">Fig. 28-2</a>). Platelet production in the marrow is regulated in part by the hormone thrombopoietin, which stimulates the production and differentiation of megakaryocytes from the myeloid stem cell. Each megakaryocyte has the capacity to produce approximately 2000 platelets; 80% of these platelets are active in the circulation and 20% are stored in the spleen (Ciesla, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Platelets play an essential role in the control of bleeding. They circulate freely in the blood in an inactive state, where they nurture the endothelium of the blood vessels, maintaining the integrity of the vessel. When vascular injury occurs, platelets collect at the site and are activated. They adhere to the site of injury and to each other, forming a platelet plug that temporarily stops bleeding. Substances released from platelet granules activate coagulation factors in the blood plasma and initiate the formation of a stable clot composed of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fibrin:&lt;/b&gt; filamentous protein; basis of thrombus and blood clot">fibrin</button></strong>, a filamentous protein. Platelets have a normal lifespan of 7 to 10 days (Ciesla, 2019b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Plasma and Plasma Proteins</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After cellular elements are removed from blood, the remaining liquid portion is called <em>plasma.</em> More than 90% of plasma is water. The remainder consists primarily of plasma proteins; clotting factors (particularly fibrinogen); and small amounts of other substances, such as nutrients, enzymes, waste products, and gases. If plasma is allowed to clot, the remaining fluid is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;serum:&lt;/b&gt; portion of blood remaining after coagulation occurs">serum</button></strong>. Serum has essentially the same composition as plasma, except that fibrinogen and several clotting factors have been removed during the clotting process.</p>
<p class="indent">Plasma proteins consist primarily of albumin and globulins. The globulins can be separated into three main fractions (alpha, beta, and gamma), each of which consists of distinct proteins that have different functions. Important proteins in the alpha and beta fractions are the transport globulins and the clotting factors that are made in the liver. The transport globulins carry various substances in bound form in the circulation. For example, thyroid-binding globulin carries thyroxin, and transferrin carries iron. The clotting factors, including fibrinogen, remain in an inactive form in the blood plasma until activated by the clotting cascade. The gamma-globulin fraction refers to the Igs, or antibodies. These proteins are produced by well-differentiated B lymphocytes and plasma cells. The actual fractionation of the globulins can be seen on a specific laboratory test (serum protein electrophoresis).</p>
<p class="indent">Albumin is particularly important for the maintenance of fluid balance within the vascular system. Capillary walls are impermeable to albumin, so its presence in the plasma creates an osmotic force that keeps fluid within the vascular space. Albumin, which is produced by the liver, has the capacity to bind to several substances that are transported in plasma (e.g., certain medications, bilirubin, and some hormones). People with impaired hepatic function may have low concentrations of albumin, with a resultant decrease in osmotic pressure and the development of edema.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1060">Reticuloendothelial System (RES)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>reticuloendothelial system (RES)</strong> is composed of special tissue macrophages. When released from the marrow, monocytes spend a short time in the circulation (about 24 hours) and then enter the body tissues. Within the tissues, the monocytes continue to differentiate into macrophages, which can survive for months or years. Macrophages have a variety of important functions. They defend the body against foreign invaders (i.e., bacteria and other pathogens) via phagocytosis. They remove old or damaged cells from the circulation. They stimulate the inflammatory process and present antigens to the immune system (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Banaski, 2019</a>). Macrophages give rise to tissue histiocytes, phagocytic cells that are present in loose connective tissue. These include Kupffer cells of the liver, peritoneal macrophages, alveolar macrophages, and other components of the RES. Thus, the RES is a component of many other organs within the body, particularly the spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver.</p>
<p class="indent">The spleen is the site of activity for most macrophages. Most of the spleen (75%) is made of red pulp; here, the blood enters the venous sinuses through capillaries that are surrounded by macrophages. Within the red pulp are tiny aggregates of white pulp, consisting of B and T lymphocytes. The spleen sequesters newly formed reticulocytes from the marrow, removing nuclear fragments and other materials (e.g., damaged or defective hemoglobin, iron) before the now fully mature erythrocyte returns to the circulation. If the spleen is enlarged, a greater number of red cells and platelets can be sequestered. The spleen is a major source of hematopoiesis in fetal life. It can resume hematopoiesis later in adulthood if necessary, particularly when marrow function is compromised (e.g., in bone marrow fibrosis). The spleen has important immunologic functions as well. It forms substances called <em>opsonins</em> that promote the phagocytosis of neutrophils; it also forms the antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM) after exposure to an antigen.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Hemostasis is the process of preventing blood loss from intact vessels and of stopping bleeding from a severed vessel, which requires adequate numbers of functional platelets. Platelets nurture the endothelium and thereby maintain the structural integrity of the vessel wall. Two processes are involved in arresting bleeding: primary and secondary hemostasis (see <a href="#ff28-3">Fig. 28-3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In primary hemostasis, the severed blood vessel constricts. Circulating platelets aggregate at the site and adhere to the vessel and to one another. An unstable hemostatic plug is formed. For the coagulation process to be correctly activated, circulating inactive coagulation factors must be converted to active forms. This process occurs on the surface of the aggregated platelets at the site of vessel injury.</p>

When the endothelial surface of a blood vessel is injured, several processes occur. In primary hemostasis, platelets within the circulation are attracted to the exposed layer of collagen at the site of injury. They adhere to the site of injury, releasing factors that stimulate other platelets to aggregate at the site, forming an unstable platelet plug. In secondary hemostasis, based on the type of stimulus, one of two clotting pathways is initiated&#x2014;the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway&#x2014;and the clotting factors within that pathway are activated. The end result from either pathway is the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin is necessary for fibrinogen to be converted into fibrin, the stabilizing protein that anchors the fragile platelet plug to the site of injury to prevent further bleeding and permit the injured vessel or site to heal.

<p class="indent">The end result is the formation of fibrin, which reinforces the platelet plug and anchors it to the injury site. This process is referred to as secondary hemostasis. Blood coagulation is highly complex. It can be activated by the extrinsic pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) or the intrinsic pathway (also known as the contact activation pathway). Both pathways are needed for maintenance of normal hemostasis. Many factors are involved in the reaction cascade that forms fibrin. When tissue is injured, the extrinsic pathway is activated by the release of thromboplastin from the tissue. As the result of a series of reactions, prothrombin is converted to thrombin, which in turn catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Clotting by the intrinsic or contact activation pathway is activated when the collagen that lines blood vessels is exposed. Clotting factors are activated sequentially until, as with the extrinsic pathway, fibrin is ultimately formed (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Rockwell, 2019</a>). The intrinsic pathway is slower, and this sequence is less often responsible for clotting in response to tissue injury. However, it is important if a noninjured vessel wall comes into contact with lipoproteins (e.g., atherosclerosis) or with bacteria, resulting in a clot that is formed for purposes other than protection from trauma or bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">As the injured vessel is repaired and again covered with endothelial cells, the fibrin clot is no longer needed. The fibrin is digested via two systems: the plasma fibrinolytic system and the cellular fibrinolytic system. The protein <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;plasminogen:&lt;/b&gt; protein converted to plasmin to dissolve thrombi and clots">plasminogen</button></strong> is required to lyse (break down) the fibrin. Plasminogen, which is present in all body fluids, circulates with fibrinogen and is therefore incorporated into the fibrin clot as it forms. When the clot is no longer needed (e.g., after an injured blood vessel has healed), the plasminogen is activated to form plasmin. Plasmin digests the fibrinogen and fibrin. The breakdown particles of the clot, called <em>fibrin degradation products,</em> are released into the circulation. Through this system, clots are dissolved as tissue is repaired, and the vascular system returns to its normal baseline state.</p>

<p class="nonindent">In older adults, the bone marrow&#x2019;s ability to respond to the body&#x2019;s need for blood cells (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) may be decreased, resulting in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;leukopenia:&lt;/b&gt; less-than-normal amount of WBCs in circulation">leukopenia</button></strong> (a decreased number of circulating leukocytes) or anemia. This decreased ability is a result of many factors, including diminished production of the growth factors necessary for hematopoiesis by stromal cells within the marrow or a diminished response to the growth factors (in the case of erythropoietin). Over time, stem cells within the marrow acquire damage to their DNA, which compromises their function. T- and B-cell development is also decreased. This age-related decrease in immune system response due to diminished production and function of blood cells designed to protect the body is called immunosenescence (<a href="c28-sec06.xhtml#bib2079">Yeager, 2019</a>).</p>
