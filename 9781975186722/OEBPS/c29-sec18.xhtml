<h4 class="h4" id="s1187">Hyperhomocysteinemia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Homocysteine is known to promote platelet aggregation. When hyperhomocysteinemia is present, the endothelial lining of blood vessels are denuded, which can lead to thrombus formation, specifically VTE (e.g., DVT, PE) and arterial thrombosis (e.g., ischemic stroke, ACS); however, the evidence available does not clearly identify homocysteine as a causal factor. Research suggests that the mechanisms through which hyperhomocysteinemia causes vascular disease are more complex than an increase in homocysteine alone (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2166">Ospina-Romero, Cannegieter, den Heijer, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Hyperhomocysteinemia can be hereditary but may also occur as a result of folate deficiency, and to a lesser degree, deficiency of vitamins B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub>. These nutrients are cofactors in homocysteine metabolism. Additionally, for reasons that are unclear, older adults and those with kidney injury may also have elevated homocysteine levels without vitamin deficiency (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Ostrakhovich &#x0026; Tabibzadeh, 2019</a>). While a fasting measurement of plasma homocysteine can be useful for screening in some cases, levels may be normal or slightly elevated in people with inherited hyperhomocysteinemia or those with vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency. A more sensitive method of measurement involves obtaining a second measurement 4 hours after consumption of methionine; hyperhomocysteinemia is found more often using this method. Supplemental use of folic acid, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, or vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has not been shown to be effective in reducing the recurrence of venous or arterial thromboemboli (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Middeldorp &#x0026; Coppens, 2016</a>). Smoking is associated with reduced levels of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, vitamin B<sub>12,</sub> and folate, making smoking cessation an important goal for patients with known hyperhomocysteinemia.</p>
