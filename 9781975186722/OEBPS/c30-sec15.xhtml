<h4 class="h4a" id="s1251">MULTIPLE MYELOMA</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Multiple myeloma is a malignant disease of the most mature form of B lymphocyte&#x2014;the plasma cell. Plasma cells secrete immunoglobulins, which are proteins necessary for antibody production to fight infection. This disease accounts for approximately 1.8% of all cancers and about 17% of the hematologic malignancies in the United States (NCCN, 2019i). The etiology of multiple myeloma is not known, but risk factors are identified (see <strong><a href="#ct30-3">Chart 30-3</a></strong>). The incidence of multiple myeloma increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years (NCCN, 2019i; Rajkumar, 2018). This disease, if left untreated, can lead to bone destruction and bone marrow failure. Due to the increased number of newer agents to fight multiple myeloma, survival of this disease has significantly improved in the last 5 years.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1252">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In multiple myeloma, the malignant plasma cells produce a specific immunoglobulin that is nonfunctional. Functional types of immunoglobulins are still produced by nonmalignant plasma cells, but in lower-than-normal quantities. The specific immunoglobulin secreted by the malignant plasma cells is referred to as the monoclonal protein, or M protein. Malignant plasma cells also secrete certain substances to stimulate angiogenesis to enhance the growth of these clusters of plasma <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page975" title="975"></span>cells. Occasionally, the malignant plasma cells infiltrate other tissue, in which case they are referred to as plasmacytomas. Plasmacytomas can occur in the sinuses, spinal cord, and soft tissues.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Multiple myeloma may evolve from a premalignant stage, known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (NCCN, 2019i). Although patients with MGUS have the M protein in their blood, they generally do not have any signs and symptoms that are seen in multiple myeloma. Patients with MGUS are monitored for signs and symptoms indicative of disease progression to multiple myeloma. The rate of progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma is 0.5% to 1% per year (<a href="#bib2261">Rajkumar, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1253">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma result not only from the malignant cells themselves, but also from the abnormal protein they produce. The classic clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma are referred to as the CRAB features, because they refer to the following:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>hyper<strong><em>C</em></strong>alcemia</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><em>R</em></strong>enal dysfunction</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><em>A</em></strong>nemia</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span><strong><em>B</em></strong>one destruction</p>
<p class="indent">Bone-related manifestations may be seen in up to 85% of patients with multiple myeloma (NCCN, 2019i). Bone pain (usually in the back or ribs) is considered to be a classic presenting symptom. Bone pain associated with multiple myeloma increases with movement and decreases with rest; patients may report that they have less pain on awakening but more during the day. In multiple myeloma, a substance secreted by the malignant plasma cells, osteoclast activating factor, and other substances, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulate osteoclasts, which break down bone matrix. In some cases, the bone breakdown or lysis can be severe enough to cause vertebral collapse and fractures, including spinal fractures, which can impinge on the spinal cord and result in spinal cord compression (see <a href="#ff30-11">Fig. 30-11</a>). When vertebral collapse occurs, the patient&#x2019;s height is reduced and kyphosis (an excessive curvature of the spine) is common.</p>
<p class="indent">If the bone lysis is extensive, bone lesions result and excessive ionized calcium is lost from the bone and enters the serum; hypercalcemia may therefore develop and may be manifested by excessive thirst, dehydration, constipation, altered mental status, confusion, and perhaps coma.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Any older adult whose chief complaint is back pain and who has an elevated total protein level should be evaluated for possible multiple myeloma.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Renal dysfunction occurs in 33% of patients at the time of diagnosis, while 50% will experience renal dysfunction at some point during the course of the disease (Chim, Kumar, Orlowski, et&#x00A0;al., 2018; NCCN, 2019i). The etiology of renal dysfunction is multicausal and related to: myeloma kidney as the result of Bence&#x2013;Jones proteins (i.e., myeloma infiltration of the kidneys) causing obstruction in the renal tubules; hypercalcemia as the result of bone matrix lysis; amyloid deposits which may lead to renal insufficiency and/or hydronephrosis; and hyperviscosity leading to renal tubule obstruction. Other causes of renal dysfunction in patients with multiple myeloma are infections, use of NSAIDs, and nephrotoxic agents (e.g., chemotherapy) to treat multiple myeloma (<a href="#bib2208">Faiman, Doss, Colson, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As more malignant plasma cells are produced, the marrow has less space for erythrocyte production, and anemia may develop. If renal dysfunction is also present, anemia may also be caused by a diminished production of erythropoietin by the kidney. In the late stage of the disease, a reduced number of leukocytes and platelets may also be seen because the bone marrow is infiltrated by malignant plasma cells.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1254">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All patients suspected of having multiple myeloma should have a CBC with differential, BUN, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, serum electrolytes (especially calcium and albumin), LDH, and beta-2 microglobulin analyzed. Elevated BUN and creatinine may be indicative of renal dysfunction. The total protein level is frequently elevated because of the production of M protein. LDH and beta-2 microglobulin measure degree of tumor burden. In addition to these, a peripheral smear of the blood may reveal an abnormal stacking of RBCs (known as Rouleaux formation) due to elevated serum proteins (NCCN, 2019i). Serum protein electrophoresis or free light chain assay should be performed to detect the presence of M protein (see <a href="#ff30-12">Fig. 30-12</a>). This protein is elevated in patients with multiple myeloma and serves as a useful marker to monitor the extent of the disease and to gauge the patient&#x2019;s eventual response to therapy. Additionally, cytogenetic studies are performed to see if any of several chromosomal abnormalities typically found in patients with multiple myeloma are present. Radiographic evaluation (CT scan, MRI, and PET scan) should be performed to determine the presence of lytic bone lesions. Bone marrow aspiration <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page976" title="976"></span>and biopsy are conducted to evaluate bone marrow plasma cell abnormalities.</p>

<p class="indent">Diagnosis and staging of multiple myeloma was traditionally based on the CRAB criteria, and included:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>hypercalcemia (&#x003E;11.5 mg/dL)</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>renal insufficiency (creatinine &#x003E;2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min)</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>anemia (hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or 2 g/dL less than normal)</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>the presence of bony lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) recently revised the metrics used to define the disease to include specific biomarkers (clonal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy of 60% or greater, involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio of 100 or greater, and/or more than one focal lesion on MRI that is at least 5 mm or greater in size) in addition to any one or more of the CRAB criteria (NCCN, 2019i; Rajkumar, 2018). This revision is believed to facilitate earlier diagnosis and implementation of treatment (NCCN, 2019i).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1255">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is no cure for multiple myeloma; the aims of treatment are to reduce symptoms and to prolong disease progression. Therapy has changed substantively for multiple myeloma, and has resulted in impressive increases in duration <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page977" title="977"></span>of survival. Importantly, patients not only live longer, the new treatment modalities provide the opportunity for enhanced quality of life. Management of multiple myeloma depends upon whether the patient has smoldering (asymptomatic) or active (symptomatic) disease. Smoldering multiple myeloma is similar to MGUS as patients do not report any symptoms; however, there are higher levels of M protein than seen in MGUS and malignant plasma cells are present.</p>
<p class="indent">For most patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, observation with close surveillance for the possibility of transforming to symptomatic disease every 3 to 6 months is the standard of care (NCCN, 2019i; Rajkumar, 2018). Patients who present with symptomatic disease are evaluated for eligibility for an autologous HSCT (AuHSCT), based on age, presence of comorbidities, and risk stratification (<a href="#bib2261">Rajkumar, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Primary treatment for patients who are eligible for AuHSCT includes several cycles of a combination of different pharmacologic agents before stem cells are procured. These drugs all target the disease via different mechanisms than do conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Combinations of two or three drugs are commonly used with the goal of reducing the tumor burden as much as possible. These frequently include either one of the following two regimens (<a href="#bib2261">Rajkumar, 2018</a>):</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Proteasome inhibitor&#x2013;based bortezomib regimen, which commonly includes an immunomodulatory drug (e.g., lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide) and the corticosteroid dexamethasone.</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>MoAb-based daratumumab regimen, which commonly includes either an immunomodulatory drug (e.g., lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide) or a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib, or ixazomib) and the corticosteroid dexamethasone.</p>
<p class="indent">Other agents that may be part of these regimens include doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, or etoposide (see <a href="#tt30-5">Table 30-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">AuHSCT is considered to be the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma following primary therapy (NCCN, 2019i), as it has demonstrated improved response rates, improved quality of life, and increased overall survival. AuHSCT may also be indicated in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Single AuHSCT and tandem AuHSCT (with two AuHSCT within a 6-month period) are possible options. Another option could be an allogeneic HSCT; however, this is considered an inferior option to AuHSCT as it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (<a href="#bib2261">Rajkumar, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Lenalidomide is recommended as maintenance therapy for patients following an AuHSCT and after the initial 8 to 12 cycles of primary therapy for patients who have not received an HSCT. Bortezomib may be used as an alternative maintenance treatment in patients who are intermediate to high risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are not candidates for AuHSCT might be prescribed the three-drug, bortezomib-based regimen, as this regimen is associated with a better response rate. For older adults or frail patients, two-drug regimens may be given (e.g., lenalidomide and dexamethasone) (<a href="#bib2261">Rajkumar, 2018</a>). The regimen for patients with renal dysfunction includes bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (NCCN, 2019i).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these agents, all patients with multiple myeloma should be prescribed a bisphosphonate, such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid (NCCN, 2019i). Bisphosphonates have been shown to strengthen bone by diminishing survival of osteoclasts, thus controlling bone pain and potentially preventing bone fractures. These agents are also effective in managing and preventing hypercalcemia by preventing excessive bone resorption. Some evidence suggests that bisphosphonates may activate an antimyeloma immune response, inducing myeloma cell death, acting synergistically with antineoplastic drugs, and enhancing immune surveillance (<a href="#bib2208">Faiman et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>, <a href="c36-sec06.xhtml#tt36-1">Table 36-1</a>, for further discussion of bisphosphonates).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1256">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Infection is a potential complication of multiple myeloma and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. In contrast to other hematologic malignancies, the incidence of infection does not appear to be related to the extent of neutropenia in patients with multiple myeloma. Rather, the lack of adequate levels of normal immunoglobulins, as well as other alterations of the immune system, renders the patient at increased risk for developing infection, particularly due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> or <em>H. influenzae</em>. Therapy for the disease also predisposes the patient for acquiring infections, particularly when corticosteroids are used in treating the disease; herpes zoster and <em>Pneumocystis</em> are common causative organisms in this context (NCCN, 2019i). Infection prophylaxis with antiviral agents and antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole) is important to decrease infection risk.</p>
<p class="indent">When plasma cells secrete excessive amounts of immunoglobulin, the serum viscosity can increase. Hyperviscosity may be manifested by bleeding from the nose or mouth, headache, visual changes such as blurred vision or diplopia, paresthesias, or heart failure. The incidence of hyperviscosity is rare but does have the potential to be lethal. It is considered to be an oncologic emergency and as such, requires immediate intervention with aggressive hydration and plasmapheresis or therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce immunoglobulin and protein levels and to decrease symptoms (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>, <a href="c28-sec04.xhtml#tt28-3">Table 28-3</a>, for further discussion of plasmapheresis).</p>
<p class="indent">Neurologic complications can also occur. Spinal cord compression is the most common (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#tt12-13">Table 12-13</a>, for discussion of manifestations and management of spinal cord compression), and other neurologic symptoms may be present, particularly peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy may occur in as many as 75% of patients with multiple myeloma either due to infiltration of malignant plasma cells into the peripheral nerves or due to neurotoxic agents prescribed to treat the disease (e.g., bortezomib and thalidomide) (<a href="#bib2208">Faiman et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can range from mild discomfort to severe impairment and even paralysis and may lead to dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">VTE may occur in patients with myeloma; the incidence is thought to be as high as 10% (NCCN, 2019i). The risk increases substantially when high doses of corticosteroids and immumodulatory drugs (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page978" title="978"></span>pomalidomide) are used to treat the disease (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion of VTE management).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1257"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Historically, aggressive multiple myeloma therapy, particularly HSCT, was limited to patients younger than age 65, but this approach has changed. Patients older than age 65 who have excellent organ function (i.e., renal, hepatic, cardiopulmonary) and who have fewer comorbidities may tolerate more intense treatment, including AuHSCT (Faiman et&#x00A0;al., 2017; NCCN, 2019i). Determining an older adult patient&#x2019;s ability to tolerate therapy <em>a priori</em> is important. In addition to chronologic age, organ function, and comorbidity, the ability to independently perform activities of daily living is another important factor. A comprehensive assessment of all these <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page980" title="980"></span>factors is useful to better determine the level of &#x201C;fitness&#x201D; in a given patient. Patients categorized as frail may develop more severe toxicity associated with therapy and consequently are more likely to discontinue that treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The older adult patient may have different goals of care from that of younger patients. Effective symptom control, preserving cognitive function, and maintaining independence are often viewed as higher priority than survival in the older adult. Discussing these goals of care as well as the patient&#x2019;s physical and social needs can provide a more personalized approach to treating the older adult with multiple myeloma. Using lower doses of agents and focusing on side effect management are important treatment strategies. Side effects should be managed without additional medications to reduce the burden of polypharmacy. Incorporating the expertise of a palliative care clinician may be extremely beneficial, not only in devising an appropriate treatment plan, but also in managing symptoms and side effects more effectively.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1258">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain management is very important in patients with multiple myeloma. NSAIDs can be very useful for mild pain or can be given in combination with opioid analgesics. Because NSAIDs can cause gastritis and renal dysfunction, renal function must be carefully monitored and patients assessed for GI complications; many patients are unable to use NSAIDs due to concurrent or newly developed renal insufficiency. Long-acting opioids are often prescribed to afford adequate pain relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care should focus on assessing for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Common presenting symptoms include polyuria and GI problems (nausea, constipation, anorexia). Patients progressively become more dehydrated, with possible confusion and stupor as well as decreased renal function as the hypercalcemia worsens. Treatment for hypercalcemia includes aggressive hydration, bisphosphonates, and/or corticosteroids. See <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#tt12-13">Table 12-13</a>, for a discussion of manifestations of and treatment for hypercalcemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient education should include methods to prevent and minimize the risk of infection, reportable signs and symptoms, medication side effects, and pain management. Any new complaint or worsening of pain requires immediate intervention. Another key nursing responsibility is to assess for and provide emotional/psychological support. Educating patients about effective coping skills to aid in dealing with multiple myeloma and its treatment is a key intervention.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient needs to be educated about activity restrictions (e.g., lifting no more than 10 lb, the use of proper body mechanics) to reduce the risk of pathologic fracture. Braces are occasionally needed to support the spinal column, but may be uncomfortable and hamper adherence. Bisphosphonate therapy has markedly reduced the severity and extent of bone pain. However, patients need to understand the importance of comprehensive oral hygiene and good dental care to diminish the likelihood of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw that may arise from bisphosphonate therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Renal function must be monitored closely. Kidney injury can become severe, and dialysis may be needed. Maintaining high urine output (3 L/day) can be very useful in preventing or limiting this complication, as is treating the underlying disease. The patient also needs to be educated about the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. While hypercalcemia usually occurs at the onset of the disease, it can also develop at the time of disease progression or when multiple myeloma becomes refractory to therapy. Maintaining mobility and hydration are important to diminish exacerbations of this complication.</p>
<p class="indent">Because antibody production is impaired, infections, particularly bacterial infections, are common and can be life-threatening. The patient needs education regarding appropriate infection prevention measures and should be advised to contact the primary provider immediately if fever or other signs and symptoms of infection develop. The patient should receive pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. Prophylactic antibiotics, such as trimethoprim&#x2013;sulfamethoxazole, are often used, particularly when patients are treated with corticosteroid-containing regimens to prevent <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (NCCN, 2019i). The antiviral agent acyclovir may be prescribed when patients are treated with bortezomib-based regimens to diminish the potential development of viral infection, such as herpes zoster. The patient must be educated about the indications for these prophylactic measures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Continuing and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many medications prescribed to treat multiple myeloma, particularly the immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., lenalidomide, thalidomide), are associated with higher risks of VTE formation, particularly when used concurrently with high doses of corticosteroids or erythropoietin. Other VTE risk factors include decreased mobility, obesity, prior thromboembolic events, diabetes, cardiac or renal disease, and the presence of a vascular access device (e.g., PICC). It is important to maintain mobility and to use strategies that enhance venous return (e.g., anti-embolism stockings, avoid crossing the legs). For patients without additional risk factors, VTE can be prevented by taking low-dose aspirin. Those patients with additional risk factors for developing VTE should receive anticoagulation therapy (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">Peripheral neuropathy is a frequent issue for patients with multiple myeloma, affecting over 50% at the time of diagnosis (<a href="#bib2208">Faiman et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). It is particularly commonplace in patients who are prescribed thalidomide or bortezomib. Painful neuropathy can be quite disabling and may interfere with the patient&#x2019;s ability to perform normal activities of daily living (<a href="#bib2197">Olsen et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>) (see <a href="#tt30-6">Table 30-6</a>). The nurse needs to carefully assess for symptoms related to peripheral neuropathy and make assessments of the home for safety. Sensation (touch, temperature, pain, vibration, proprioception), ankle reflexes, distal muscle strength, and blood pressure should be evaluated. Other risk factors for peripheral neuropathy (e.g., diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, viral infection, or excessive alcohol consumption) should be aggressively managed. Patients should be educated to report any symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and to not minimize such symptoms, because prompt cessation of therapy or reducing the dose can prevent the neuropathy from progressing. Resuming treatment with a lower dosage and at a longer interval between dosing may diminish the worsening of peripheral nerve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page981" title="981"></span>damage. Recovery can occur over time, although it may be incomplete. Gabapentinoids (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), and selective SSRIs (e.g., duloxetine) can be prescribed to diminish pain; opioids are fairly ineffective in this context.</p>
