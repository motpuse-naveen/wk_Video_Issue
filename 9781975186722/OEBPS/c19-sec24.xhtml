<h4 class="h4" id="s727">Blunt Trauma</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Overall, blunt thoracic injuries are directly responsible for 20% to 25% of all trauma deaths (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Mancini, 2018</a>). Although blunt chest trauma is more common than penetrating trauma, it is often difficult to identify the extent of the damage because the symptoms may be generalized and vague. In addition, patients may not seek immediate medical attention, which may complicate the problem.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s728">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most common causes of blunt chest trauma are motor vehicle crashes (trauma from steering wheel, seat belt), falls, and bicycle crashes (trauma from handlebars). Types of blunt chest trauma include chest wall fractures, dislocations, and barotraumas (including diaphragmatic injuries); injuries of the pleura, lungs, and aerodigestive tracts; and blunt injuries of the heart, great arteries, veins, and lymphatics (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Mancini, 2018</a>). Injuries to the chest are often <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page590" title="590"></span>life-threatening and result in one or more of the following pathologic states:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Hypoxemia from disruption of the airway; injury to the lung parenchyma, rib cage, and respiratory musculature; massive hemorrhage; collapsed lung; and pneumothorax</span></li>
<li><span>Hypovolemia from massive fluid loss from the great vessels, cardiac rupture, or hemothorax</span></li>
<li><span>Cardiac failure from cardiac tamponade, cardiac contusion, or increased intrathoracic pressure</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">These pathologic states frequently result in impaired V./Q. leading to acute kidney injury, hypovolemic shock, and death.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s729">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because time is critical in treating chest trauma, the patient must be assessed immediately to determine the following: time elapsed since injury occurred, mechanism of injury, level of responsiveness, specific injuries, estimated blood loss, recent drug or alcohol use, and prehospital treatment. Initial assessment of thoracic injuries includes assessment of airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, flail chest, and cardiac tamponade. These injuries are life-threatening and require immediate treatment. Secondary assessment includes assessment of simple pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, traumatic aortic rupture, tracheobronchial disruption, esophageal perforation, traumatic diaphragmatic injury, and penetrating wounds to the mediastinum. Although listed as secondary, these injuries may be life-threatening as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The physical examination includes inspection of the airway, thorax, neck veins, and breathing difficulty. Specifics include assessing the rate and depth of breathing for abnormalities such as stridor, cyanosis, nasal flaring, the use of accessory muscles, drooling, and overt trauma to the face, mouth, or neck. The chest is assessed for symmetric movement, symmetry of breath sounds, open chest wounds, entrance or exit wounds, impaled objects, tracheal shift, distended neck veins, subcutaneous emphysema, and paradoxical chest wall motion. In addition, the chest wall is assessed for bruising, petechiae, lacerations, and burns. The vital signs and skin color are assessed for signs of shock. The thorax is palpated for tenderness and crepitus, and the position of the trachea is also assessed.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial diagnostic workup includes a chest x-ray, CT scan, complete blood count, clotting studies, type and cross-match, electrolytes, oxygen saturation, arterial blood gas analysis, and ECG. The patient is completely undressed to avoid missing additional injuries that may complicate care. Many patients with injuries involving the chest have associated head and abdominal injuries that require attention. Ongoing assessment is essential to monitor the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment and to detect early signs of clinical deterioration.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s730">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of treatment are to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s condition and to initiate aggressive resuscitation. An airway is immediately established with oxygen support and, in some cases, ET intubation and ventilatory support. Reestablishing fluid volume and negative intrapleural pressure and draining intrapleural fluid and blood are essential.</p>
<p class="indent">The potential for massive blood loss and exsanguination with blunt or penetrating chest injuries is high because of injury to the great blood vessels. Many patients die at the scene of the injury or are in shock by the time help arrives. Agitation and irrational and combative behavior are signs of decreased oxygen delivery to the cerebral cortex. Strategies to restore and maintain cardiopulmonary function include ensuring an adequate airway and ventilation; stabilizing and reestablishing chest wall integrity; occluding any opening into the chest (open pneumothorax); and draining or removing any air or fluid from the thorax to relieve pneumothorax, hemothorax, or cardiac tamponade. Hypovolemia and low cardiac output must be corrected. Many of these treatment efforts, along with the control of hemorrhage, are carried out simultaneously at the scene of the injury or in the emergency department. Depending on the success of efforts to control the hemorrhage in the emergency department, the patient may be taken immediately to the operating room. Principles of management are essentially those pertaining to care of the postoperative thoracic patient (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Urden et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s731">Sternal and Rib Fractures</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Sternal fractures are most common in motor vehicle crashes with a direct blow to the sternum via the steering wheel. Rib fractures are the most common type of chest trauma with blunt chest injury (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Mancini, 2018</a>). Most rib fractures are benign and are treated conservatively; ribs 4 through 10 are most frequently involved. Fractures of the first three ribs are rare but can result in a high mortality rate because they are associated with laceration of the subclavian artery or vein. Fractures of the lower ribs are associated with injury to the spleen and liver, which may be lacerated by fragmented sections of the rib. Older adult patients with three or more rib fractures have been shown to have a fivefold increased mortality rate and a fourfold increased incidence of pneumonia (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Mancini, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s732">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with sternal fractures have anterior chest pain, overlying tenderness, ecchymosis, crepitus, swelling, and possible chest wall deformity. For patients with rib fractures, clinical manifestations are similar: severe pain, point tenderness, and muscle spasm over the area of the fracture that are aggravated by coughing, deep breathing, and movement. The area around the fracture may be bruised. To reduce the pain, the patient splints the chest by breathing in a shallow manner and avoids sighs, deep breaths, coughing, and movement. This reluctance to move or breathe deeply results in diminished ventilation, atelectasis (collapse of unaerated alveoli), pneumonitis, and hypoxemia. Respiratory insufficiency and failure can be the outcomes of such a cycle.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s733">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient must be closely evaluated for underlying cardiac injuries. A crackling, grating sound in the thorax (subcutaneous crepitus) may be detected with auscultation. The diagnostic workup may include a chest x-ray, rib films of a specific area, ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gas analysis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s734">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management is directed toward relieving pain, avoiding excessive activity, and treating any associated injuries. Surgical fixation is rarely necessary unless fragments are grossly displaced and pose a potential for further injury.</p>
<p class="indent">The goals of treatment of rib fractures are to control pain and to detect and treat the injury. Sedation is used to relieve pain and to allow deep breathing and coughing. Care must be taken to avoid oversedation and suppression of respiratory drive. Alternative strategies to relieve pain include an intercostal nerve block and ice over the fracture site. A chest binder may be used as supportive treatment to provide stability to the chest wall and may decrease pain. The patient is instructed to apply the binder snugly enough to provide support, but not to impair respiratory excursion. Usually, the pain abates in 5 to 7 days, and discomfort can be relieved with epidural analgesia, PCA, or nonopioid analgesia. Most rib fractures heal in 3 to 6 weeks. The patient is monitored closely for signs and symptoms of associated injuries.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s735">Flail Chest</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Flail chest is frequently a complication of blunt chest trauma, which may occur from a steering wheel injury, motor vehicle crash involving a pedestrian or cyclist, a significant fall onto the chest, or an assault with a blunt weapon. The incidence of flail chest among patients with chest wall injury is 5% to 13% (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Sarani, 2019</a>). It occurs when three or more adjacent ribs (multiple contiguous ribs) are fractured at two or more sites, resulting in free-floating rib segments. It may also result as a combination fracture of ribs and costal cartilages or sternum. As a result, the chest wall loses stability, causing respiratory impairment and usually severe respiratory distress.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s736">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During inspiration, as the chest expands, the detached part of the rib segment (flail segment) moves in a paradoxical manner (pendelluft movement) in that it is pulled inward during inspiration, reducing the amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs. On expiration, because the intrathoracic pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, the flail segment bulges outward, impairing the patient&#x2019;s ability to exhale. The mediastinum then shifts back to the affected side (see Fig.&#x00A0;19-11). This paradoxical action results in increased dead space, a reduction in alveolar ventilation, and decreased compliance. Retained airway secretions and atelectasis frequently accompany flail chest. The patient has hypoxemia, and if gas exchange is greatly compromised, respiratory acidosis develops as a result of carbon dioxide retention. Hypotension, inadequate tissue perfusion, and metabolic acidosis often follow as the paradoxical motion of the mediastinum decreases cardiac output.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s737">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As with rib fracture, treatment of flail chest is usually supportive. Management includes providing ventilatory support, clearing secretions from the lungs, and controlling pain. Specific management depends on the degree of respiratory dysfunction. If only a small segment of the chest is involved, the objectives are to clear the airway through positioning, coughing, deep breathing, and suctioning to aid in the expansion of the lung, and to relieve pain by intercostal nerve blocks, high thoracic epidural blocks, or cautious use of IV opioids.</p>
<p class="indent">For mild-to-moderate flail chest injuries, the underlying pulmonary contusion is treated by monitoring fluid intake and appropriate fluid replacement while relieving chest pain. Pulmonary physiotherapy focusing on lung volume expansion and secretion management techniques is performed. The patient is closely monitored for further respiratory compromise.</p>
<p class="indent">For severe flail chest injuries, ET intubation and mechanical ventilation are required to provide internal pneumatic stabilization of the flail chest and to correct abnormalities in gas exchange. This helps to treat the underlying pulmonary contusion, serves to stabilize the thoracic cage to allow the fractures to heal, and improves alveolar ventilation and intrathoracic volume by decreasing the work of breathing. This treatment modality requires ET intubation and mechanical ventilator support. Differing modes of ventilation are used depending on the patient&#x2019;s underlying disease and specific needs.</p>
<p class="indent">Rib-specific plating systems may be used for three or more rib fractures or flail chest in order to achieve chest wall stabilization (CWS). These systems are inserted internally in the operating room, preferably within the first 72 hours of injury (see <a href="#ff19-12">Fig.&#x00A0;19-12</a>). The benefits of their use include decreased bleeding, less inflammation, and reduced chest wall deformities. Contraindications for CWS include traumatic brain injury and unstable spine fracture. With coexisting pulmonary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page592" title="592"></span>contusion the overall efficacy of CWS remains controversial (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1518">Milanez de Campos &#x0026; White, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Regardless of the type of treatment, the patient is carefully monitored by serial chest x-rays, arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and bedside pulmonary function monitoring. Pain management is key to successful treatment. PCA, intercostal nerve blocks, epidural analgesia, and intrapleural administration of opioids may be used to relieve or manage thoracic pain.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s738">Pulmonary Contusion</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary contusion is a common thoracic injury and is frequently associated with flail chest. It is defined as damage to the lung tissues resulting in hemorrhage and localized edema. It is associated with chest trauma when there is rapid compression and decompression to the chest wall (i.e., blunt trauma). Pulmonary contusion represents a spectrum of lung injury characterized by the development of infiltrates and various degrees of respiratory dysfunction and sometimes respiratory failure. It is often cited as the most common potentially life-threatening chest injury; however, mortality is often attributed to other associated injuries. Pulmonary contusion may not be evident initially on examination but develops in the posttraumatic period; it may involve a small portion of one lung, a massive section of a lung, one entire lung, or both lungs. Depending on the extent of injury, this type of trauma may be associated with a mortality rate greater than 50% (<a href="c19-sec28.xhtml#bib1564">Mancini, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s739">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The primary pathologic defect is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitial and intra-alveolar spaces. It is thought that injury to the lung parenchyma and its capillary network results in a leakage of serum protein and plasma. The leaking serum protein exerts an osmotic pressure that enhances loss of fluid from the capillaries. Blood, edema, and cellular debris (from cellular response to injury) enter the lung and accumulate in the bronchioles and alveoli, where they interfere with gas exchange. An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure occurs. The patient has hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s740">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary contusion may be mild, moderate, or severe. The clinical manifestations vary from decreased breath sounds, tachypnea, tachycardia, chest pain, hypoxemia, and blood-tinged secretions to more severe tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles, frank bleeding, severe hypoxemia (cyanosis), and respiratory acidosis. Changes in sensorium, including increased agitation or combative irrational behavior, may be signs of hypoxemia.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, patients with moderate pulmonary contusion have a large amount of mucus, serum, and frank blood in the tracheobronchial tree; patients often have a constant cough but cannot clear the secretions. Patients with severe pulmonary contusion have signs and symptoms that mirror ARDS, which may include central cyanosis; agitation; combativeness; and productive cough with frothy, bloody secretions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s741">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The efficiency of gas exchange is determined by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas measurements. Pulse oximetry is also used to measure oxygen saturation continuously. The initial chest x-ray may show no changes; changes may not appear for 1 or 2 days after the injury and appear as pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s742">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment priorities include maintaining the airway, providing adequate oxygenation, and controlling pain. In mild pulmonary contusion, adequate hydration via IV fluids and oral intake is important to mobilize secretions. However, fluid intake must be closely monitored to avoid hypervolemia. Volume expansion techniques, postural drainage, physiotherapy including coughing, and ET suctioning are used to remove the secretions. Pain is managed by intercostal nerve blocks or by opioids via PCA or other methods. Usually, antimicrobial therapy is given because the damaged lung is susceptible to infection. Supplemental oxygen is usually given by mask or cannula for 24 to 36 hours.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with moderate pulmonary contusion, bronchoscopy may be required to remove secretions. Intubation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP may also be necessary to maintain the pressure and keep the lungs inflated. A nasogastric tube is inserted to relieve gastrointestinal distention.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with severe contusion, who may develop respiratory failure, aggressive treatment with ET intubation and ventilatory support, diuretics, and fluid restriction may be necessary. Antimicrobial medications may be prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary infection. This is a common complication of pulmonary contusion (especially pneumonia in the contused segment) because the fluid and blood that extravasate into the alveolar and interstitial spaces serve as an excellent culture medium.</p>
