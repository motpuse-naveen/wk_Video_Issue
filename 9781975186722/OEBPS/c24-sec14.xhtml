<h4 class="h4" id="s917">Myocarditis</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Myocarditis, an inflammatory process involving the myocardium, can cause heart dilation, thrombi on the heart wall (mural thrombi), infiltration of circulating blood cells around the coronary vessels and between the muscle fibers, and degeneration of the muscle fibers themselves. Mortality varies with the severity of symptoms. Most patients with mild symptoms recover completely; however, some patients develop cardiomyopathy and heart failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s918">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Myocarditis usually results from an infectious source, be it viral (e.g., coxsackieviruses A and B, human immune deficiency virus, influenza A), bacterial, rickettsial, fungal, parasitic, metazoal, protozoal (e.g., Chagas disease), or spirochetal. It also may be immune related, occurring after acute systemic infections such as rheumatic fever, or it may be related to an autoimmune disorder. It may also result from an inflammatory reaction to toxins such as pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of other diseases (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1789">Arbustini, Agozzino, Favalli, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). It may begin in one small area of the myocardium and then spread throughout the myocardium. The degree of myocardial inflammation and necrosis determines the degree of interstitial collagen and elastin destruction. The greater the destruction, the greater is the hemodynamic effect and resulting signs and symptoms. It is thought that DCM and HCM are latent manifestations of myocarditis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s919">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The symptoms of acute myocarditis depend on the type of infection, the degree of myocardial damage, and the capacity of the myocardium to recover. Patients may be asymptomatic, with an infection that resolves on its own. However, they may develop mild to moderate symptoms and seek medical attention, often reporting fatigue and dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, and occasional discomfort in the chest and upper abdomen. The most common symptoms are flulike. Patients may also sustain sudden cardiac death or quickly develop severe congestive heart failure in fulminant myocarditis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s920">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the patient may reveal no detectable abnormalities; as a result, the illness can go undiagnosed. Patients may be tachycardic or may report chest pain. An endomyocardial biopsy can provide the definitive diagnosis (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1789">Arbustini et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>), but cardiac MRI is being used more often as a diagnostic tool because of its noninvasive approach (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1853">Lakdawala, Stevenson, &#x0026; Loscalzo, 2018</a>). With contrast, cardiac MRI may be diagnostic and can guide clinicians to sites for endomyocardial biopsies, which may be also indicated to find an organism or its genome, an immune process, or a radiation reaction causing the myocarditis. Patients without any abnormal heart structure (at least initially) may suddenly develop arrhythmias or ST&#x2013;T-wave changes. If the patient has structural heart abnormalities (e.g., systolic dysfunction), a clinical assessment may disclose cardiac enlargement, faint heart sounds (especially S<sub>1</sub>), pericardial friction rub, a gallop rhythm, or a systolic murmur. The WBC count, C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, and ESR may be elevated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s921">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are given specific treatment for the underlying cause if it is known (e.g., penicillin for hemolytic streptococci) and are placed on bed rest to decrease cardiac workload. Bed rest also helps decrease myocardial damage and the complications of myocarditis. In young patients with myocarditis, activities, especially athletics, should be limited for a 6-month period or at least until heart size and function have returned to normal. Physical activity is increased slowly, and the patient is instructed to report any symptoms that occur with increasing activity, such as a rapidly beating heart. If heart failure or arrhythmia develops, management is essentially the same as for all causes of heart failure and arrhythmias (see Chapters 25 and 22, respectively). Although they are known for their anti-inflammatory effects, NSAIDs should not be used for pain control; they have been implicated in increased cardiac injury and viral replication in animal studies (<a href="c24-sec15.xhtml#bib1796">Lakdawala et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s922">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse assesses for resolution of tachycardia, fever, and any other clinical manifestations. The cardiovascular assessment focuses on signs and symptoms of heart failure and arrhythmias. Patients with arrhythmias should have continuous cardiac monitoring with personnel and equipment readily available to treat life-threatening arrhythmias.</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Patients with myocarditis are sensitive to digitalis. Nurses must closely monitor these patients for digitalis toxicity, which is evidenced by a new onset of arrhythmia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, and malaise. The primary provider should be notified immediately if this is suspected.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Anti-embolism stockings and passive and active exercises should be used because embolization from venous thrombosis and mural thrombi can occur, especially in patients on bed rest. In some patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis may also be indicated (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>).</p>
