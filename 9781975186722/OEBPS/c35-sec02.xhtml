<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Hand Assessment of Older Adults</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Leow, M. Q., Teo, W., Low, T. L., et&#x00A0;al. (2019). Hand assessment for elderly people in the community. <em>Orthopaedic Nursing</em>, <em>38</em>(1), 25&#x2013;30.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Hand and wrist disorders are common, particularly among older adults. These disorders typically include osteoarthritis, trigger finger, and carpal tunnel syndrome. These conditions can cause significant pain, stiffness, numbness, and decreased range of motion in the affected extremity. Early treatment may mitigate the detrimental effects of these disorders; yet, treatment is uncommon until later, when there is a disruption in the patient&#x2019;s activities of daily living (ADLs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these hand disorders among older adults in a community setting.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This descriptive study solicited participation from older adults who frequented a neighborhood day center in Singapore. All eligible participants were independent in completing their ADLs. Demographic information, a brief health history, hand and wrist assessments, and grip and pinch strength were obtained from all participants. Questionnaires completed by participants included the 11-item QuickDASH questionnaire, a psychometrically validated tool for assessing functional ability of the upper extremities, and a numeric pain intensity scale score that assessed hand and wrist pain. Assessments were conducted specifically for participants who were experiencing symptoms associated with osteoarthritis, trigger finger, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Fifty-five older adults participated in this study.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Participants (<em>N</em> = 55) ranged in age from 60 to 90 years with a mean age of 74 years. The majority of participants were female (<em>n</em> = 41). Nearly one third of participants presented with a hand condition (<em>n</em> = 17); 11 had osteoarthritis, one had trigger finger, three had carpal tunnel syndrome, and two had both trigger finger and carpal tunnel. Hand disorders were more prevalent in female participants than in males (39% in females, 7% in males). Of those with hand disorders, 34.5% reported difficulty in doing household chores, 21.8% had difficulty opening jars, and 21.8% reported difficulty participating in recreational activities that required arm, shoulder, or hand strength. This study found that participants who had an abnormal hand assessment finding did not seek medical attention until these conditions impacted their ADLs.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that hand and wrist disorders are indeed commonplace among community-dwelling older adults; yet most study participants had not previously sought medical treatment for their disorders. Nurses may develop screening programs for hand and wrist disorders in older adults with the tools used in this study. Screening older adults for early-stage hand and wrist disorders can lead to timely and effective treatment that can preserve function and assist the older adult to maintain independence in ADLs.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1410">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An important aspect of a musculoskeletal assessment is the history of the present illness. Musculoskeletal disorders may be stable or progressive, characterized by symptom-free periods as well as fluctuations in symptoms. The health history therefore includes details about the onset, character, severity, location, duration, and frequency of symptoms and signs; associated complaints; precipitating, aggravating, and relieving factors; progression, remission, and exacerbation; and the presence or absence of similar symptoms among family members.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">During the interview and physical assessment, the patient with a musculoskeletal disorder may report pain, tenderness, and altered sensations (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Most patients with diseases and traumatic conditions or disorders of the muscles, bones, and joints experience pain. Bone pain is typically described as a dull, deep ache that is &#x201C;boring&#x201D; in nature. This pain is not typically related to movement and may interfere with sleep. Muscular pain is described as soreness or aching and is referred to as &#x201C;muscle cramps.&#x201D; Fracture pain is sharp and piercing and is relieved by immobilization. Sharp pain may also result from bone infection with muscle spasm or pressure on a sensory nerve. Joint pain is felt around or in the joint and typically worsens with movement (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2516">Kennedy-Malone et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Rest relieves most musculoskeletal pain. Pain that increases with activity may indicate joint sprain, muscle strain, or compartment syndrome, whereas steadily increasing pain points to the progression of an infectious process (osteomyelitis), a malignant tumor, or neurovascular complications. Radiating pain occurs in conditions in which pressure is exerted on a nerve root (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2516">Kennedy-Malone et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The time of day that the pain occurs may be important to evaluate. Those experiencing pain with an inflammatory rheumatic disorder experience pain that is worse in the morning, especially upon waking. Tendonitis worsens during the early morning and eases by midday, whereas osteoarthritis worsens as the day progresses (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2516">Kennedy-Malone et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Pain is variable, and its assessment and nursing management must be individualized.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s pain as described in <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. Specific assessments that the nurse should make regarding the pain include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Is the body in proper alignment?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the joints symmetrical or are bony deformities present?</span></li>
<li><span>Is there any inflammation or arthritis, swelling, warmth, tenderness, or redness?</span></li>
<li><span>Is there pressure from traction, bed linens, a cast, or other appliances?</span></li>
<li><span>Is there tension on the skin at a pin site?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s pain and discomfort must be managed successfully. Not only is pain exhausting, but also, if prolonged, it can force the patient to become increasingly withdrawn and dependent on others as the musculoskeletal disorder continues.</p>
<p class="h7">Altered Sensations</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sensory disturbances are frequently associated with musculoskeletal problems. The patient may describe <strong>paresthesias</strong>, which are sensations of burning, tingling, or numbness. These sensations may be caused by pressure on nerves or by circulatory impairment. Soft tissue swelling or direct trauma to these structures can impair their function. The nurse assesses the neurovascular status of the involved musculoskeletal area.</p>
<p class="indent">Questions that the nurse should ask regarding altered sensations include the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Is the patient experiencing abnormal sensations, such as burning, tingling, or numbness?</span></li>
<li><span>If the abnormal sensation involves an extremity, how does this feeling compare to sensation in the unaffected extremity?</span></li>
<li><span>When did the condition begin? Is it getting worse?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the patient also have pain? (If the patient has pain, then the questions and assessments for pain discussed previously should be followed.)</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health, Social, and Family History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">When assessing the musculoskeletal system, the nurse should gather pertinent data to include in the patient&#x2019;s health history, such as occupation (e.g., does the patient&#x2019;s work require physical activity or heavy lifting?), exercise patterns, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and dietary intake (e.g., calcium, vitamin D). Concurrent health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infection, preexisting disability) and related problems (e.g., familial or genetic abnormalities; see <a href="#ct35-2">Chart 35-2</a>) need to be considered when developing and implementing the plan of care. Any previous history of trauma or injury to the musculoskeletal system or a history of falls should be included as well (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>)</p>
<p class="nonindent">The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX&#x00AE;) was developed in 2008 by a task force convened by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a tool that predicts a patient&#x2019;s 10-year risk of fracturing a hip or other major bone, which includes the spine, forearm, or shoulder (NOF, 2019). The tool may be accessed online, where it automatically calculates a patient&#x2019;s odds of fracture. Data entered are validated risks for fracture, and include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>age (risk increases with increasing age)</span></li>
<li><span>gender (risk is higher in females)</span></li>
<li><span>body mass index (risk is higher with lower body mass indices)</span></li>
<li><span>history of a previous fracture</span></li>
<li><span>parental history of hip fracture</span></li>
<li><span>current cigarette smoker</span></li>
<li><span>current use of a corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone)</span></li>
<li><span>history of rheumatoid arthritis</span></li>
<li><span>alcohol intake of 3 or more drinks per day</span></li>

<p class="indent">An additional validated risk factor that may be entered into the FRAX<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> is the patient&#x2019;s bone mineral density (BMD), based on bone densitometry results, if those results are hip based (see later discussion). However, while entering BMD results in the FRAX<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> provides a more accurate fracture risk calculation, it is not necessary (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>). Thus, the FRAX<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> provides a good estimate of fracture risk in patients who may not have submitted to BMD testing. Patients who should be assessed for hip or major bone fracture risk include men and postmenopausal women over the age of 50, patients with known low BMD, and patients with known secondary causes/risks for osteoporosis. See <a href="c36.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> for further discussion of osteoporosis.</p>

<p class="nonindent">An examination of the musculoskeletal system ranges from a basic assessment of functional capabilities to sophisticated physical examination maneuvers that facilitate diagnosis of specific bone, muscle, and joint disorders. The extent of assessment depends on the patient&#x2019;s physical complaints, health history, and physical clues that warrant further exploration. The nursing assessment is primarily a functional evaluation, focusing on the patient&#x2019;s ability to perform ADLs.</p>
<p class="indent">Techniques of inspection and palpation are used to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s posture, gait, bone integrity, joint function, and muscle strength and size. In addition, assessing the skin and neurovascular status is an important part of a complete musculoskeletal assessment. The nurse should also understand and be able to perform correct assessment techniques on patients with musculoskeletal trauma. When specific symptoms or physical findings of musculoskeletal dysfunction are apparent, the nurse carefully documents the examination findings and shares the information with the primary provider, who may decide that a more extensive examination and a diagnostic evaluation are necessary.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Posture</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The normal curvature of the spine is convex through the thoracic portion and concave through the cervical and lumbar portions. Common deformities of the spine include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;kyphosis:&lt;/b&gt; increase in the convex curvature of the thoracic spine">kyphosis</button></strong>, which is an increased forward curvature of the thoracic spine that causes a bowing or rounding of the back, leading to a hunchback or slouching posture. The second deformity of the spine is referred to as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lordosis:&lt;/b&gt; increase in concave curvature of the lumbar spine">lordosis</button></strong>, or swayback, an exaggerated curvature of the lumbar spine. A third deformity is <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;scoliosis:&lt;/b&gt; lateral curving of the spine">scoliosis</button></strong>, which is a lateral curving deviation of the spine (<a href="#ff35-4">Fig. 35-4</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1106" title="1106"></span>Kyphosis can occur at any age and may be caused by degenerative diseases of the spine (e.g., arthritis or disc degeneration), fractures related to osteoporosis, and injury or trauma (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Meiner &#x0026; Yeager, 2019</a>). It may also be seen in patients with other neuromuscular disease. Lordosis can affect people of any age. Common causes of lordosis include tight low back muscles, excessive visceral fat, and pregnancy as the woman adjusts her posture in response to changes in her center of gravity. Scoliosis may be congenital, idiopathic (without an identifiable cause), or the result of damage to the paraspinal muscles (e.g., muscular dystrophy).</p>

<img src="images/ff35-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff35-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;35-4 &#x2022;</span> A normal spine and three abnormalities. <strong>A.</strong> Kyphosis: an increased convexity or roundness of the spine&#x2019;s thoracic curve. <strong>B.</strong> Lordosis: swayback; exaggeration of the lumbar spine curve. <strong>C.</strong> Scoliosis: a lateral curvature of the spine.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">During inspection of the spine, the entire back, buttocks, and legs are exposed. The examiner inspects the spinal curves and trunk symmetry from posterior and lateral views. Standing behind the patient, the examiner notes any differences in the height of the shoulders or iliac crests. Shoulder and hip symmetry, as well as the line of the vertebral column, is inspected with the patient erect and with the patient bending forward (flexion). Scoliosis is evidenced by an abnormal lateral curve in the spine; shoulders that are not level; an asymmetric waistline; and a prominent scapula, which is accentuated by bending forward. The examiner should then instruct the patient to bend backward (extension) with the examiner supporting the patient by placing hands on the posterior iliac spine (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Older adults experience a loss in height due to the loss of vertebral cartilage and osteoporosis-related vertebral compression fractures. Therefore, an adult&#x2019;s height should be measured during each health screening.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gait</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Gait is assessed by having the patient walk away from the examiner for a short distance. The examiner observes the patient&#x2019;s gait for smoothness and rhythm. Any unsteadiness or irregular movements (frequently noted in older adult patients) are considered abnormal. A limping motion is most frequently caused by painful weight bearing. In such instances, the patient can usually pinpoint the area of discomfort, thus guiding further examination. If one extremity is shorter than another, a limp may also be observed as the patient&#x2019;s pelvis drops downward on the affected side with each step. The knee should be flexed during normal gait; therefore, limited joint motion may interrupt the smooth pattern of gait. Evaluation of the knee involves the joints, bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, and may include tests for the anterior and collateral ligaments, medial and lateral ligaments, and medial meniscus (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). In addition, a variety of neurologic conditions are associated with abnormal gait, such as a spastic hemiparesis gait (stroke), steppage gait (lower motor neuron disease), and shuffling gait (Parkinson&#x2019;s disease).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bone Integrity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The bony skeleton is assessed for deformities and alignment. Symmetric parts of the body, such as extremities, are compared. Abnormal bony growths due to bone tumors may be observed. Shortened extremities, amputations, and body parts that are not in anatomic alignment are noted. Fracture findings may include abnormal angulation of long bones, motion at points other than joints, and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;crepitus:&lt;/b&gt; grating or crackling sound or sensation; may occur with movement of ends of a broken bone or irregular joint surface">crepitus</button></strong> (a grating or crackling sound or sensation) at the point of abnormal motion. Movement of fracture fragments must be minimized to avoid additional injury. The nurse should include the following observations (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>If the affected part is an extremity, how does its overall appearance compare to the unaffected extremity?</span></li>
<li><span>Can the patient move the affected part? If an extremity is involved, does each toe or finger have normal sensation and motion (flexion and extension), and is the skin warm or cool?</span></li>
<li><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1107" title="1107"></span>What is the color of the part distal to the affected area? Is it pale? Dusky? Mottled? Cyanotic?</span></li>
<li><span>Does rapid capillary refill occur? (The nurse can gently squeeze a nail until it blanches, then release the pressure. The amount of time for the color under the nail to return to normal is noted. Color normally returns within 3 seconds. The return of color is evidence of capillary refill.)</span></li>
<li><span>Is a pulse distal to the affected area palpable? If the affected area is an extremity, how does the pulse compare to the pulse of the unaffected extremity?</span></li>
<li><span>Is edema present?</span></li>
<li><span>Is any constrictive device or clothing causing nerve or vascular compression?</span></li>
<li><span>Does elevating the affected part or modifying its position affect the symptoms?</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Joint Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The articular system is evaluated by noting range of motion, deformity, stability, tenderness, and nodular formation. Range of motion is evaluated both actively (the joint is moved by the muscles surrounding the joint) and passively (the joint is moved by the examiner). The examiner is familiar with the normal range of motion of major joints. Precise measurement of range of motion can be made by a goniometer (a protractor designed for evaluating joint motion) (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>). Limited range of motion may be the result of skeletal deformity, joint pathology, or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;contracture:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal shortening of muscle, joint, or both; fibrosis">contracture</button></strong> (shortening of surrounding joint structures) of the surrounding muscles, tendons, and joint capsule. In older adult patients, limitations of range of motion associated with osteoarthritis may reduce their ability to perform ADLs (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If joint motion is compromised or the joint is painful, the joint is examined for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;effusion:&lt;/b&gt; excess fluid in joint">effusion</button></strong> (excessive fluid within the capsule), swelling, and increased temperature that may reflect active inflammation. An effusion is suspected if the joint is swollen and the normal bony landmarks are obscured. The most common site for joint effusion is the knee. If large amounts of fluid are present in the joint spaces beneath the patella, it may be identified by assessing for the balloon sign and for ballottement of the knee (<a href="#ff35-5">Fig. 35-5</a>). If inflammation or fluid is suspected in a joint, consultation with a specialist (e.g., orthopedic surgeon or rheumatologist) is indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Joint deformity may be caused by contracture, dislocation (complete separation of joint surfaces), subluxation (partial separation of articular surfaces), or disruption of structures <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1108" title="1108"></span>surrounding the joint. Weakness or disruption of joint-supporting structures may result in a weak joint that requires an external supporting appliance (e.g., brace).</p>

The medial and lateral aspects of the extended knee are milked firmly in a downward motion, which displaces any fluid downward. The examiner feels for any fluid entering the space directly inferior to the patella. When larger amounts of fluid are present, the subpatellar region feels as if it is &#x201C;ballooning,&#x201D; and the balloon sign test is positive. <strong>B.</strong> Technique for ballottement sign. The medial and lateral aspects of the extended knee are milked firmly in a downward motion. The examiner pushes the patella toward the femur and observes for fluid return to the region superior to the patella. When larger amounts of fluid are present, the patella elevates, there is visible return of fluid to the region directly superior to the patella, and the ballottement test is positive.

<p class="indent">Palpation of the joint while it is moved passively provides information about the integrity of the joint. Normally, the joint moves smoothly. A snap or crack may indicate that a ligament is slipping over a bony prominence. Slightly roughened surfaces, as in arthritic conditions, result in crepitus as the irregular joint surfaces move across one another (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The tissues surrounding joints are examined for nodule formation. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and osteoarthritis may produce characteristic nodules. The subcutaneous nodules of rheumatoid arthritis are soft and occur within and along tendons that provide extensor function to the joints. The nodules of gout are hard and lie within and immediately adjacent to the joint capsule itself. They may rupture, exuding white uric acid crystals onto the skin surface. Osteoarthritic nodules are hard and painless and represent bony overgrowth that has resulted from the destruction of the cartilaginous surface of bone within the joint capsule. They are frequently seen in older adults (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Often, the size of the joint is exaggerated by atrophy of the muscles proximal and distal to that joint. This is seen in rheumatoid arthritis of the knees, in which the quadriceps muscle may atrophy dramatically. In rheumatoid arthritis, joint involvement assumes a symmetric pattern (<a href="#ff35-6">Fig. 35-6</a>). See <a href="c34.xhtml">Chapter 34</a> for further information about rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Muscle Strength and Size</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The muscular system is assessed by noting muscular strength and coordination, the size of individual muscles, and the patient&#x2019;s ability to change position. Weakness of a group of muscles may indicate a variety of conditions, such as polyneuropathy, electrolyte disturbances (particularly potassium and calcium), myasthenia gravis, poliomyelitis, and muscular dystrophy. By palpating the muscle while passively moving the relaxed extremity, the nurse can determine the muscle tone (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>). Muscle strength is assessed by having the patient perform certain maneuvers with and without added resistance. For example, when the biceps are tested, the patient is asked to extend the arm fully and then to flex it against resistance applied by the nurse. A simple handshake may provide an indication of grasp strength.</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse may elicit muscle <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;clonus:&lt;/b&gt; rhythmic contractions of a muscle">clonus</button></strong> (rhythmic contractions of a muscle) in the ankle or wrist by sudden, forceful, sustained dorsiflexion of the foot or extension of the wrist. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fasciculation:&lt;/b&gt; involuntary twitch of muscle fibers">Fasciculation</button></strong> (involuntary twitching of muscle fiber groups) may be observed.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse measures the girth of an extremity to monitor increased size due to exercise, edema, or bleeding into the muscle. Girth may decrease due to muscle atrophy. The unaffected extremity is measured and used as the reference standard for the affected extremity. Measurements are taken at the maximum circumference of the extremity. It is important that the measurements be taken at the same location on the extremity, and with the extremity in the same position, with the muscle at rest. Distance from a specific anatomic landmark (e.g., 10 cm below the medial aspect of the knee for measurement of the calf muscle) should be indicated in the patient&#x2019;s record so that subsequent measurements can be made at the same point. For ease of serial assessment, the nurse may indicate the point of measurement by marking the skin. Variations in size greater than 1 cm are considered significant (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Skin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to assessing the musculoskeletal system, the nurse inspects the skin for edema, temperature, and color. Palpation of the skin may reveal whether any areas are warmer, suggesting increased perfusion or inflammation, or cooler, suggesting decreased perfusion, and whether edema is present. Cuts, bruises, skin color, and evidence of decreased circulation or inflammation can influence nursing management of musculoskeletal conditions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neurovascular Status</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse must perform frequent neurovascular assessments of patients with musculoskeletal disorders (especially of those with fractures) because of the risk of tissue and nerve damage. <a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#ct35-3">Chart 35-3</a> describes methods the nurse may use to evaluate peripheral nerve function. The nurse needs to be particularly aware of signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome (which is described in detail later in this unit) when assessing the patient with a musculoskeletal injury. This neurovascular problem is caused by pressure within a muscle compartment that increases to such an extent that microcirculation diminishes, leading to nerve and muscle anoxia and necrosis. Function can be permanently lost if the anoxic situation continues for longer than 6 hours. Assessment of neurovascular status (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#ct35-4">Chart 35-4</a>) is frequently referred to as assessment of CMS (circulation, motion, and sensation).</p>
