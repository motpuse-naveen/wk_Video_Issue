<p class="nonindent">Vulvovaginal infections are common, and nurses have an important role in providing information that may prevent their occurrence. To help prevent these infections, women need to understand their anatomy and normal vulvovaginal health.</p>
<p class="indent">The Bartholin glands on either side of the entrance to the vagina can become blocked (cyst formation) or infected (abscess formation) (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3686">Ball, Dains, Flynn, et al., 2019</a>). Treatment is different for both cyst and abscess formation, but pain is common with both. Pain can interfere with sitting and walking.</p>
<p class="indent">The vagina is protected against infection by its normally low pH (3.5 to 4.5), which is maintained in part by the actions of <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus,</em> the dominant bacteria in a healthy vaginal ecosystem. These bacteria suppress the growth of anaerobes and produce lactic acid, which maintains normal pH. They also produce hydrogen peroxide, which is toxic to anaerobes (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Paavonen &#x0026; Brunham, 2018</a>). The risk of infection increases if a woman&#x2019;s resistance is reduced by stress or illness, if the pH is altered, or if a pathogen is introduced (see <a href="#ct51-1">Chart&#x00A0;51-1</a>). Continued research into causes and treatments is needed, along with better ways to encourage growth of lactobacilli.</p>

<p class="indent">The epithelium of the vagina is highly responsive to estrogen, which induces glycogen formation. The subsequent breakdown of glycogen into lactic acid assists in producing a low vaginal pH. When estrogen decreases during lactation and menopause, glycogen also decreases. With reduced glycogen formation, infections may occur. In addition, as estrogen production ceases during the peri- and postmenopausal periods, the vagina and labia may atrophy (thin), making the vaginal area more susceptible to infection. When patients are treated with antibiotic agents, the normal vaginal flora is reduced. This results in altered pH and growth of fungal organisms. Other factors that may initiate or predispose to infections include contact with an infected partner and wearing tight, nonabsorbent, and heat- and moisture-retaining clothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;vaginitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the vagina, usually secondary to infection">Vaginitis</button></strong> (inflammation of the vagina) is a group of conditions that cause vulvovaginal symptoms such as itching, irritation, burning, and abnormal discharge. Bacterial vaginitis is the most common cause, followed by trichomoniasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Paladine &#x0026; Desai, 2018</a>) (see Table&#x00A0;51-1). Other types include desquamative vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, various vulvar dermatologic conditions, and vulvodynia. Normal vaginal discharge, which may occur in slight amounts during ovulation or just before the onset of menstruation, is clear to white, odorless, and viscous. It becomes more profuse when vaginitis occurs. Urethritis may accompany vaginitis because of the proximity of the urethra to the vagina. Discharge that occurs with vaginitis may produce itching, odor, redness, burning, or edema, which may be aggravated by voiding and defecation. After the causative organism has been identified, appropriate treatment (discussed later) is prescribed. This may include an oral medication or a local medication that is inserted into the vagina using an applicator.</p>
