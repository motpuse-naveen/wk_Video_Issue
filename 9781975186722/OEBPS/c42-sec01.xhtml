<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;obesity:&lt;/b&gt; a disease characterized by an abnormal or excessive accumulation of body fat that impairs health">Obesity</button></strong> is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an &#x201C;abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health&#x201D; (WHO, 2018, p. 1). As a response to endorsements by multiple health care organizations and societies, including the American College of Cardiology, the Endocrine Society, and the American College of Surgeons, to name a few, the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates in 2013 officially resolved that obesity should be diagnosed and treated as a disease (AMA, 2013). This resolution was based on the scientific observation that obesity followed criteria commonly used for defining a disease; namely, it can be said that obesity impairs normal bodily function, possesses characteristic signs and symptoms, and causes morbidity (AMA, 2013).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1776">Epidemiology of Obesity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Worldwide, over 650 million adults have obesity, and another 1.9 billion are overweight (WHO, 2018). Since 1975, the prevalence of obesity has more than tripled for men, and more than doubled for women. In particular, 3% of the world&#x2019;s men and 6% of the world&#x2019;s women had obesity in 1975, whereas 11% of the world&#x2019;s men and 15% of the world&#x2019;s women had obesity in 2016 (WHO, 2018). The burden of obesity is significant in both developed and developing nations. The WHO (2018) notes that many developing nations are now facing a &#x201C;double-burden&#x201D; effect from disorders linked to nutrition and metabolism; that is, these nations must simultaneously deal with the public health threats of both undernutrition and obesity. In developing nations, obesity has become particularly prevalent in urban settings (WHO, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Since 1980, the number of adults with obesity in the United States has continued to rise (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Henry, 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3234">Trust for America&#x2019;s Health [TFAH] &#x0026; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [RWJF], 2018</a>). The prevalence of obesity in the United States is now the 12th highest among nations in the world, with Nauru, an island nation in Micronesia, being first, with an obesity prevalence of 61% (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3187">Hales, Carroll, Fryar, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3187">Hales, Fryar, Carroll, et al., 2018</a>). Among American adults, an estimated 42.4% have obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Hales et al., 2020</a>); an estimated 70.9% have obesity or are overweight (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Hales et al., 2018</a>). The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity is slightly higher among American women than American men, and among African Americans and Hispanics than among Whites or Asian Americans (see <a href="#ff42-1">Fig. 42-1</a>). In general, those who are less educated and earn less income are more likely to have obesity, reflecting socioeconomic disparities in the disease burden of obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Hales et al., 2018</a>; TFAH &#x0026; RWJF, 2018). Being overweight or having obesity is the primary reason why young American adults are excluded from military service (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Warren, Beck, &#x0026; Rayburn, 2018</a>) (see later discussion in Veterans Considerations section).</p>
<p class="indent">The economic burden of obesity to American society extends beyond limiting young adults with obesity from pursuing military service commitments. It is estimated that annual health care costs tied to obesity are approximately $190 billion (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Warren et al., 2018</a>), and that average annual health care expenditures for Americans with obesity are $3429 higher per person than for those Americans without obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Biener, Cawley, &#x0026; Meyerhoefer, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1777">Obesity Risks</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The causes of obesity are complex and multifactorial, and include behavioral, environmental, physiologic, and genetic factors. While there are certain demographic groups who seem to be at risk for obesity (see <a href="#ff42-1">Fig. 42-1</a>) and while there are notable familial patterns of obesity, identification of risk factors that specify odds of being diagnosed with obesity is not as clearly elucidated as those for other diseases (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3170">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020</a>), such as coronary artery disease (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>) and cerebrovascular disease (see <a href="c62.xhtml">Chapter 62</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">What is abundantly clear, however, is that obesity incurs a greater overall risk of mortality. Obesity alone does not decrease a person&#x2019;s lifespan (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3198">Kuk, Rotondi, Sui, et al., 2018</a>). However, obesity is associated with a 2- to 6-year decrease in overall life expectancy when coupled with metabolic disease or another chronic illness (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Khan, Ning, &#x0026; Wilkins, 2018</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1344" title="1344"></span>Furthermore, obesity is associated with morbidity and mortality from numerous other diseases (see <a href="#ff42-2">Fig. 42-2</a> and <a href="#ct42-1">Chart 42-1</a>). For instance, as body mass index (BMI) increases, so does the overall risk of cancer and risk for death from cancer; obesity is responsible for up to 90,000 deaths from cancer annually. Having obesity increases the likelihood of having type 2 diabetes by 10-fold and the likelihood of having either asthma or hypertension by nearly fourfold (American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery [ASMBS], 2019b). Adults with obesity are twice as likely to eventually be diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease than those adults who maintain a normal weight (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Biener et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1778">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat and weight gain (ASMBS, 2019a). These increases in body fat cause <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adiposopathy:&lt;/b&gt; dysfunction of adipose tissue that causes chronic inflammation and disease">adiposopathy</button></strong>, a dysfunction of adipose tissue, which promotes the development of metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial diseases and disorders (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3179">Fruh, 2017</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3245">Wu &#x0026; Berry, 2018</a>). Dysfunctional adipose tissue cells release biochemical mediators that cause chronic inflammatory changes, which can lead to a multitude of diseases, including heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes (ASMBS, 2018a).</p>
<p class="indent">At the most fundamental level, obesity results from a metabolic imbalance, characterized by an excess of caloric consumption relative to caloric expenditures. That is, too many foods are consumed and too little physical activity is conducted over the long term, resulting in weight gain (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Norris, 2019</a>). According to the &#x201C;thrifty gene&#x201D; hypothesis, the human <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;genome:&lt;/b&gt; the total genetic complement of an individual genotype">genome</button></strong> (i.e., the total complement of genes in humans) was sequenced during times when finding and storing food sources expended more energy than during contemporary times. Hunting for scarce food sources during prehistoric times consumed a lot of energy, and food sources were not abundant. Storing fat to provide energy sources during times of food scarcity was a physiologic adaptive response to these environmental challenges (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3153">van Meijel, Blaak, &#x0026; Goossens, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The &#x201C;thrifty gene&#x201D; hypothesis has come under scrutiny in recent years, however, as human genome sequencing research findings suggest that a far more complex genetic explanation may be responsible for the recent global obesity pandemic. Research has identified 79 syndromes and 31 genes that cause obesity through monogenic (single gene) mutations and polygenic (multiple gene) mutations as well as gene&#x2013;environment interactions (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3224">Rohde, Keller, la Cour Poulsen, et al., 2019</a>). Although to date only 19 syndromes have been genetically characterized, it has been recognized that having at least one different genetic mutation can strongly predispose people who have ready access to food sources to having obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Rohde et al., 2019</a>). For instance, the presence of a variant mutation of the <em>FTO</em> gene is associated with more daily meals, snacks, and fat and sweet intake (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Rohde et al., 2019</a>). However, these types of single genetic mutations are relatively rare occurrences, and therefore cannot account for the high prevalence of obesity. Most people who are predisposed to obesity are thought to have a collection of several genetic mutations from more than 700 possible mutated genes that each can contribute to several pounds of additional body fat (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3246">Yengo, Sidorenko, Kemper, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The types and quantities of foods consumed affect complex digestive and metabolic pathways. Certain processed and high caloric foods that contain fructose corn syrup, simple sugars, or trans fats, are hypothesized to be <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;obesogenic:&lt;/b&gt; a factor that promotes weight gain and obesity">obesogenic</button></strong> (i.e., promote weight gain) because they are associated with food cravings consonant with other type of addictive cravings (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3168">Campana, Brasiel, de Aguiar, et al., 2019</a>). Additionally, the portions of both entrees and desserts served in fast food restaurants have increased over the past 30 years, subtly affecting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1345" title="1345"></span>consumers&#x2019; feelings of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;satiety:&lt;/b&gt; feeling of having eaten sufficient quantities of food">satiety</button></strong> (i.e., feeling of having eaten sufficient amounts of food) (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3203">McCrory, Harbaugh, Appeadu, et al., 2019</a>). Furthermore, there is a greater variety of entrees and desserts that may be selected on the menus of most fast food restaurants, providing the illusion of healthier meal options although there are actually less healthy food alternatives available for selection than 30 years ago (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3203">McCrory et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Multiple hormones that control food cravings and feelings of fullness could be affected by individual genes. In response to periods of fasting, the hormone ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and the hormone neuropeptide Y (NPY) is secreted by the small intestines. These hormones are <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orexigenic:&lt;/b&gt; a factor that stimulates appetite">orexigenic</button></strong>, meaning that they stimulate appetite through central nervous system (CNS) pathways that lead to the hypothalamus, signaling higher neural pathways that lead to eating behaviors. Once eating occurs, multiple hormones are released throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that promote satiety, including somatostatin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and insulin, to name a few. CCK also slows gastric motility and emptying, stimulates gallbladder contraction and release of bile into the duodenum, and stimulates the release of pancreatic digestive enzymes, all of which serve to enhance the digestive process. Somatostatin also slows gastric emptying but has other effects that are in opposition to CCK, such as decreasing the secretion of bile, depending on foods consumed and metabolic needs (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Gimeno, Briere, &#x0026; Seeley, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Increases in fat stores, or adipose tissue, result in increases in the hormone leptin, which is secreted by fat cells. Leptin also has the effect of signaling satiety in the hypothalamus. Patients with obesity who lose weight are thought to also have drops in leptin levels that persist for the long term, creating persistent feelings of hunger, which may partially explain why many patients with obesity who lose weight tend to regain it (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Campana et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">By adulthood, the GI tract <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;microbiota:&lt;/b&gt; the complement of microbes in a given environment">microbiota</button></strong>, which is the complement of microbes within the gut, has been found to contain up to 100 trillion microbes, or 10 times the cells present in the human body (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">McElroy, Chung, &#x0026; Regan, 2017</a>). The collective genome of the microbiota, or the gut <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;microbiome:&lt;/b&gt; the collective genome of all microbes in a microbiota">microbiome</button></strong>, has more than 100 times more genes than in the human genome. It has long been known that gut microbes perform numerous digestive, metabolic, and immunologic functions. The composition and diversity of these microbes may very well be tied in with obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">McElroy et al., 2017</a>). For instance, patients with obesity tend to have less diverse microbiota than patients who are of normal weight. In turn, patients with obesity who have less diverse microbiota typically also have dyslipidemia, impaired glucose metabolism, and low-grade generalized inflammatory disorders. &#x201C;Western-style diets,&#x201D; which are high in processed foods, fat, and sugars and low in fiber, are thought to not only negatively affect the diversity of the gut microbiota, but also to negatively affect the complement of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> species microbes, which are associated with a leaner type of microbiome (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">McElroy et al., 2017</a>). Whether or not it is possible to regulate the composition of the gut microbiota and prevent or treat obesity is the focus of ongoing research.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1779">Assessment of Obesity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the patient with obesity includes a health history and physical examination that evaluates the effects of obesity on the health of the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Health History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses need to approach patients with obesity with the same respectful, courteous, and empathetic behavior that they extend to patients without obesity. Confronting their own attitudes and beliefs about patients with obesity may help to mitigate biases. For instance, using patient-first language for all patients with diagnosed diseases, including the disease of obesity, can be an effective way to dispel bias. By referencing <em>the patient with obesity,</em> the nurse is effectively noting that the patient, not the disease, is the central point of concern and that the disease is amenable to treatment. On the other hand, referencing <em>the obese patient</em> tends to define the person by having obesity, which can lead to subliminal impressions that the patient is somehow responsible for having obesity. Research studies report that many health care providers, including nurses, hold negative attitudes toward patients with obesity and believe that they are indulgent, lazy, and lack willpower (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3223">Robstad, Westergren, Siebler, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Smigelski-Theiss, Gampong, &#x0026; Kurasaki, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with obesity should be assessed to see if there have been any recent increases or decreases in body weight. If the patient has recently lost or gained weight, determining if that is intentional weight loss or gain may give clues to whether or not changes in weight might be secondary to another disease process. Other useful health history information to gather includes how long the patient has had obesity (e.g., since childhood, since a pregnancy) and whether or not there is a family history of obesity. Any patterns of weight loss over time, and prior successful or unsuccessful weight loss strategies should be analyzed. A history of exercise patterns and dietary patterns (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for discussion of nutritional assessment) is also assessed. Some patients with obesity report sleep pattern disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep); therefore, typical sleeping habits are evaluated. Some patients who quit smoking report significant weight gain after smoking cessation is achieved; consequently, the patient&#x2019;s smoking status is also determined (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Perreault, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some patients with obesity may develop secondary diseases or disorders (see <a href="#ct42-1">Chart 42-1</a>) and may be prescribed medications aimed at treating those secondary diseases or disorders that can exacerbate weight gain (see <a href="#ct42-2">Chart 42-2</a>). Other patients may not have had a previous history of obesity, but may gain weight after being prescribed specific medications associated with weight gain. A history of weight gain that parallels the time frame of commencing treatment with specific prescriptive medications may suggest that the medication has a key role in promoting weight gain. In some instances, prescription medication dosages may be adjusted or another medication may be prescribed. For instance, patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity may reap the dual benefits of achieving better glycemic control and weight loss by taking the prescription drug metformin (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3164">Apovian, Aronne, Bessesen, et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Physical Assessment</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient&#x2019;s height and weight are measured to determine the <strong>body mass index (BMI)</strong>. The BMI is the definitive measure used to determine whether or not a patient has obesity; this is based on a ratio of body weight in kilograms and height in meters (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="c04-sec04.xhtml#tt4-1">Table 4-1</a>). Patients identified as overweight or pre-obese have a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and those with obesity have a BMI that exceeds 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Those with a BMI exceeding 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are considered to have severe <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1346" title="1346"></span>or extreme obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3150">Nguyen, Brethauer, Morton, et al., 2020</a>; WHO, 2017) (see <a href="#ff42-3">Fig. 42-3</a> and <a href="#tt42-1">Table 42-1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Patients with obesity may also have their waist circumferences assessed. Women with waist circumferences more than 35 inches and men with waist circumferences more than 40 inches have greater risks for obesity-related morbidity (see <a href="#ct42-1">Chart 42-1</a>) than those with smaller waistlines (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Meigs, 2019</a>). The hip may also be measured and the waist-to-hip ratio assessed. Women with waist-to-hip ratios greater than 0.80 and men with waist-to-hip ratios greater than 0.90 are presumed to have proportionally more visceral (i.e., abdominal) fat stores. This morphologic appearance is called android obesity, and is sometimes referenced as an &#x201C;apple-shaped&#x201D; appearance. Patients with android obesity have greater risk for developing hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, than patients who have gynoid obesity, also called the &#x201C;pear-shaped&#x201D; body (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>) (see <a href="#ff42-4">Fig. 42-4</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In some instances, obesity may be secondary to other diseases or disorders, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome (see <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>). In those particular cases, the diagnostic workup follows that prescribed for the primary disease or disorder, and, when the therapeutic regimen is implemented, the patient may lose weight and the obesity may even resolve (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1781">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of obesity generally includes lifestyle modification, pharmacologic management, and nonsurgical or surgical interventions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lifestyle Modification</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The first approach used to treat obesity consists of lifestyle modification aimed at weight loss and then weight maintenance. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all adults with BMIs in excess of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> be advised to engage in multicomponent behavioral interventions that include (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3173">Curry, Krist, Owens, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3200">LeBlanc, Patnode, Webber, et al., 2018</a>):</p>

<p class="indent">The most effective behavioral interventions are those considered high intensity; consisting of 12 to 24 sessions annually, which may include individual counseling sessions between the primary provider and patient, group nutrition education sessions, and physical activity sessions, to name a few (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">LeBlanc et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Wadden, Tsai, &#x0026; Tronieri, 2019</a>). These interventions are called intensive behavioral therapy. The USPSTF notes that modest weight loss of 5% total body weight can be associated with significant clinical improvements and benefits to patients with obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">LeBlanc et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A patient with obesity should be counseled to plan a caloric deficit of between 500 and 1000 calories daily from baseline, in order to achieve a 5% to 10% reduction in weight within about 6 months. This can be achieved through increasing physical activity and decreasing caloric dietary intake (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Increasing physical activity through promotion of an exercise regimen is a key recommendation that can burn calories and result in weight loss. Physical activity recommendations for all adults (those with and without obesity) include at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise weekly. In addition, muscle-strengthening exercises that engage all major muscle groups should be done at least twice weekly (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>). Patients with obesity who were previously sedentary and deconditioned may not be able to achieve this at the start; however, encouragement to move more and sit less along with 10 to 20 minutes of daily physical activity can result in weight loss and improved exercise tolerance (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Campbell &#x0026; Rutherford, 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">DiPietro &#x0026; Stachenfeld, 2017</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with obesity should be counseled that reducing dietary caloric intake is a necessary component of weight loss therapy. This must also include a change in dietary habits in order for weight loss to be sustained over the long term. It is important to identify current dietary patterns and typical daily caloric intake in order to recommend an appropriate diet plan. Assessing food records or 24-hour recalls or conducting dietary interviews are all effective methods to gather baseline dietary information from patients (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>: Dietary Data). There are a plethora of commercial diets that patients may select (see <a href="#ct42-3">Chart 42-3</a>). Regardless of the diet plan chosen, successful weight loss occurs when patients consistently make healthier dietary choices (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Thorn &#x0026; Lean, 2017</a>). To date, there have not been sufficiently rigorous longitudinal studies to determine which diet plans are superior to others in terms of achieving long-term weight loss, however (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Yeh, Glick-Bauer, &#x0026; Katz, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients need not purchase commercial diet plans in order to achieve weight loss and embrace healthy diet habits. Most nutritionists advocate that healthy diets include few processed foods, sugars, and trans fats, and are heavy in plant-based foods (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Yeh et al., 2017</a>). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an example of a superior healthy noncommercial diet. Although initially promoted to manage hypertension, the DASH diet also provides a solid foundation for achieving and maintaining weight loss due to its focus on low intake of fat and carbohydrates (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3182">Goldstein, Mayer, Graybill, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Thorn &#x0026; Lean, 2017</a>) (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>, <a href="c27-sec01.xhtml#tt27-3">Table 27-3</a>: The DASH Diet). Another healthy diet plan that may form a basis for weight loss, though not specifically designed for this purpose, is the Mediterranean Diet (see <a href="c23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). Patient education tips for managing ongoing healthy eating strategies are noted in <a href="#ct42-4">Chart 42-4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">In addition to promoting healthy exercise and diet habits, ensuring healthy sleep habits is an additional lifestyle strategy that is associated with weight loss and maintenance of a healthy weight. It is posited that sleep deprivation can cause changes in cortisol levels that promote weight gain (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>). Advising patients with sleep disturbances to plan to be in bed with lights out at least 7 hours prior to wake-up time, to create a dark, relaxing bedroom environment, to avoid activities that can cause arousal around bedtime (e.g., text messaging), and to avoid beverages with caffeine after lunchtime can all be helpful strategies aimed at ensuring a restful night&#x2019;s sleep that is consonant with weight reduction (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients who are not successful at meeting weight loss goals from lifestyle modification alone may be prescribed antiobesity medications. Some patients may exhibit initial success with lifestyle modifications, but be stymied with attempts to maintain a lower BMI over the long term. These patients may also benefit from antiobesity medications. Patients who are prescribed antiobesity medications should be counseled that these prescriptions are meant to supplement, not supplant diet modification and exercise (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Coulter, Rebello, &#x0026; Greenway, 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3226">Saunders, Umashanker, Igel, et al., 2018</a>). Indications for antiobesity medications include a BMI greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or a BMI greater than 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with concomitant morbidity that is related to being overweight (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension) (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Saunders et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Antiobesity medications work by either inhibiting GI absorption of fats, or by altering central brain receptors to enhance satiety or reduce cravings (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2016b). Each of these medications has distinct side effects and contraindications; therefore, selection of these agents is individualized (see <a href="#tt42-2">Table 42-2</a>). The patient is monitored while taking the selected medication; if the patient does not lose at least 5% body weight after 12 weeks, the prescription may need to be changed, or the patient may be referred for other weight-reduction therapy (e.g., bariatric surgery) (NIDDK, 2016b).</p>

<p class="indent">The class of antiobesity medications known as the sympathomimetic amines are only supposed to be prescribed for short-term use (i.e., no longer than 12 weeks). They have many side effects (see <a href="#tt42-2">Table 42-2</a>), and patients do tend to regain weight once they are no longer taking these medications (NIDDK, 2016b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nonsurgical Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adult patients with obesity that does not respond to lifestyle interventions or antiobesity medications and who have either Class III/severe/extreme obesity (i.e., BMI in excess of 40&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or Class II obesity (BMI 35 to 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with obesity-related diseases or disorders (e.g., OSA, type 2 diabetes) may be candidates for bariatric surgical interventions (see later discussion). As an alternative, some patients may elect to pursue minimally invasive interventions, which may include vagal blocking therapy, intragastric balloon therapy, or bariatric embolization.</p>
<p class="indent">Vagal blocking therapy, also known as gastric stimulation, involves placement of a pacemakerlike device (vBloc&#x2122;) into the subcutaneous tissue in the lateral thoracic cavity with two leads that are laparoscopically implanted at the point where the vagus nerve truncates, at the gastroesophageal junction. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1350" title="1350"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1351" title="1351"></span>A pre-programmed, pulsating signal is delivered for 12 hours daily. This signal causes intermittent &#x201C;blocking&#x201D; of the vagus nerve. Vagal blocking results in diminished gastric contraction and emptying, limited ghrelin secretion, and diminished pancreatic enzyme secretion; these cause increased satiety, decreased cravings, and diminished absorption of calories, all of which lead to weight loss (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3218">Papasavas, El Chaar, Kothari, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Results from a randomized controlled trial found greater initial and 2-year sustained weight loss with participants with obesity who received vagal blocking versus control sham device implantation (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3238">Vairavamurthy, Cheskin, Kraitchman, et al., 2017</a>). There are few adverse effects noted with use of this device, which include GI symptoms (e.g., heartburn, belching). Patients must be educated to recharge the device twice weekly for about an hour with an external coil device.</p>

<p class="indent">Intragastric balloon therapy involves endoscopic placement of a gas-filled balloon (ORBERA&#x2122;) or a saline-filled dual balloon (ReShape&#x2122;) into the stomach. The mechanism by which these devices result in weight loss is poorly understood, but thought to be related to increased feelings of satiety and decreased gastric emptying (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3199">Kurian, Kroh, Chand, et al., 2018</a>). Post insertion, the intragastric balloon(s) remain in place for 3 to 6 months, and are then deflated and removed. Studies suggest greater weight loss with these than with sham therapy or with lifestyle interventions alone (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3156">Ali, Moustarah, Kim, et al., 2015</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Kurian et al., 2018</a>). Early adverse effects include complaints of nausea and vomiting, which are generally transient and do not require balloon removal. Pancreatitis and gastric or esophageal perforation may also occur although these are rare adverse events (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Moore &#x0026; Rosenthal, 2018</a>). Balloon rupture can occur over the long term, however, which may lead to intestinal obstruction. In order to monitor for this serious complication, it is recommended that the balloon be impregnated with methylene blue pre-insertion so that patients with silent ruptures can report the presence of green urine to their primary providers and receive timely interventions to remove the deflated balloons before they cause obstruction. Patients who seem unlikely to return for follow-up appointments should not be candidates for intragastric balloons. Balloons should be removed within 6 months of placement; longer placement periods are associated with increased likelihood of rupture and intestinal obstruction (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Ali et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Endovascular bariatric embolization is in the process of undergoing clinical trials to validate its safety and effectiveness. During this procedure, the gastric fundus is embolized with microspheres (beads) via the left gastric artery. The gastric fundus secretes approximately 90% of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin that is secreted in the body; therefore, it is posited that embolizing the fundus should effectively result in diminished secretion of ghrelin (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3186">Hafezi-Nejad, Bailey, Gunn, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Kurian et al., 2018</a>). Preliminary results from clinical trials report an estimated weight loss ranging from 8% to 18% that is sustained for at least 1 year, without reported adverse events (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Vairavamurthy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1782"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">According to findings from the 2017&#x2013;2018 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of obesity for adults 60 years of age and older is 42.8%, slightly higher than the prevalence of obesity among all adults (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Hales et al., 2020</a>). Climbing rates of obesity among older adults mirrors the rate increases among all adults over the past few decades.</p>
<p class="indent">As adults age, lean skeletal mass decreases and adipose tissue increases. Adipose tissue does not burn calories as efficiently as lean skeletal mass; furthermore, basal metabolism drops by 2% for each additional decade of adult life. Therefore, older adults are more likely to gain weight unless they either increase activity levels or decrease their caloric intake (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Research suggests that older adults with obesity are at risk for complications that may negatively affect their quality of life. In particular, older adults with obesity may be at greater risk of falls and mobility impairments (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Batsis &#x0026; Zagaria, 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3208">Messier, Resnik, Beavers, et al., 2018</a>). Another study found that older adults with higher BMIs had more evidence of cognitive dysfunction compared to their normal weight counterparts (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3222">Rambod, Ghodsbin, &#x0026; Moradi, 2020</a>). More older adults with obesity are admitted to nursing homes than normal weight older adults (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3247">Zhou, Kozikowski, Pekmezaris, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There is some evidence that older adults with an overweight body mass (i.e., between 25 and 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) have reasonably good health outcomes; therefore, older adults who are overweight are not necessarily counseled to lose weight (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>). However, older adults with obesity (i.e., with BMIs in excess of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) should be encouraged to engage in lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, similar to younger adults (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Orringer et al., 2020</a>). Along with decreasing dietary caloric intake, older adult patients should be counseled that the quality of calories consumed should be the focus of the daily diet (see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <a href="c08-sec02.xhtml#ff8-2">Fig. 8-2</a>). Fats should be limited to less than 30% of total calories, while proteins should comprise 10% to 20% of the daily diet. Intake of soluble fibers (e.g., oats, pectin) is particularly important since these can lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Fewer than one third of older adults consume the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables daily (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>). Identifying barriers to consumption of these important sources of nutrients may help the older adult patient with obesity lose weight and adopt healthier eating habits. For instance, the older adult who has difficulty chewing raw fruits may enjoy fruit smoothies.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether or not older adult patients with obesity should be candidates for bariatric surgery (see later discussion) has been a point of ongoing debate. Research findings confirm that many older adults with obesity benefit from bariatric surgery, having outcomes and complications at rates comparable to their younger adult counterparts (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3171">Chouillard, Alsabah, Chahine, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Giordano &#x0026; Victorzon, 2015</a>). At present, there are no guidelines that identify the profile of which older adult patients with obesity can most benefit from bariatric surgery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1783"> <img class="m" src="images/icon27.jpg" alt=""/> Veterans Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Recruits into any branch of the U.S. military must meet prescribed height and weight requirements. Although these requirements vary slightly between branches of service, their general aim is to restrict recruitment to only applicants of normal weight. Despite having to meet height and weight standards during the recruitment process and then demonstrate the ability to meet standards of physical fitness on at least an annual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1352" title="1352"></span>basis, the rates of service members who have obesity or are overweight has reportedly tripled in the past 20 years (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3202">McCarthy, Elshaw, Szekeley, et al., 2017</a>). The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD, 2019) reported that the overall prevalence of obesity (i.e., BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) among men and women of all ages who serve in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force was 17.4% in 2019, reflecting a steady annual increase since 2014. Obesity in service members can hamper their ability to functionally meet their job requirements; as such, obesity in large sectors of the military population may adversely affect overall military readiness (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3202">McCarthy et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3228">Shiozawa, Madsen, Banaag, et al., 2019</a>). Furthermore, service members with obesity utilize more health service resources than those who are of normal weight and risk nonvoluntary separation from military service because they cannot meet physical fitness requirements (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Shiozawa et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The prevalence of obesity and overweight among the nearly 21 million military veterans in the United States is estimated to be higher than that in the general civilian population, suggesting that weight gain is widespread after separation or retirement from military service (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3232">Tarlov, Zenk, Matthews, et al., 2017</a>). Tarlov and colleagues (2017) found that 89% of all veterans (approximately 19 million veterans) lived in areas of the country where access to supermarkets, grocery stores, fitness facilities, and parks was limited, which could partially explain weight gain in veterans. Other researchers have noted that cessation of having to meet physical fitness standards, changes in daily routines, and stresses incurred during military service can also partially explain why veterans may be at greater risk of obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3167">Bookwalter, Porter, Jacobson, et al., 2019</a>). Bookwalter and colleagues (2019) prospectively studied over 28,000 veterans who separated or retired from military service and found that approximately 36% of normal weight veterans became overweight and 26% of overweight veterans had obesity within 6 years post separation. Factors that mitigated weight gains in these veterans included engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, not engaging in more than 7 hours of sedentary lifestyle behaviors daily, eating fast foods less than once per week, sleeping between 7 and 9&#x00A0;hours nightly, not currently smoking, and drinking at least one but no more than 14 alcoholic beverages weekly for men and no more than seven alcoholic beverages weekly for women (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Bookwalter et al., 2019</a>). These findings are consonant with the tenets of the United States Veterans Administration (VA) MOVE program, whose aim is to improve the health status of veterans with obesity by encouraging physical activity, good dietary choices, and weight reduction strategies (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3202">McCarthy et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3232">Tarlov et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1784"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several risks for both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been posed (see <a href="c66.xhtml">Chapter 66</a>). Early epidemiologic data from China did not identify obesity as a risk for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, with the spread of the pandemic to both Europe and North America, the two continents with the highest prevalence of obesity in the world, that risk became apparent (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3210">Moriconi, Masi, Rebelos, et al., 2020</a>). In particular, obesity seems to be a significant risk factor for younger adults requiring hospitalization to manage COVID-19 (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Kass, Duggal, &#x0026; Cingolani, 2020</a>). Obesity is also associated with prolonged hospitalization, admission to critical-care units, and overall poorer outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3193">Kalligeros, Shehadeh, Mylona, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Moriconi et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Tamara &#x0026; Tahapary, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1785">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with obesity report feeling socially marginalized, judged, and unsupported by society at large. Many times, patients with obesity report that they suffer stigmatization by their health care providers, including nurses (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3176">Eisenberg, Noria, Grover, et al., 2019</a>). The bias that nurses may have against patients with obesity may not directly affect their nursing care; however, indirectly, the consequences of this stigmatization can lead to poor health outcomes. Patients with obesity who feel stigmatized by their health care providers report increased depression, low self-esteem, and avoidance of health care appointments and health maintenance activities (e.g., diet and exercise) (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Smigelski-Theiss et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with obesity who requires medical-surgical nursing care, whether it is because the patient is admitted to the hospital, needs home health care, or is admitted to a transitional care setting, merits special considerations. Obesity can adversely affect the mechanics of ventilation and circulation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, skin integrity, and body mechanics and mobility. These adverse effects are more common with higher BMIs; thus, the patient with Class III obesity (BMI in excess of 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p class="indent">Obesity can result in anatomic remodeling, including compression of the oropharynx and increased neck circumference and chest diameter. These changes can predispose the patient with obesity to OSA (see <a href="c18.xhtml">Chapter 18</a>), respiratory failure, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is characterized by daytime hypoventilation with hypercapnea (i.e., PaCO<sub>2</sub> greater than 45 mm Hg) and hypoxemia (i.e., PaO<sub>2</sub> less than 80 mm Hg), and sleep-disordered breathing. Potential adverse effects of obesity hypoventilation syndrome can be mitigated by maintaining the patient in the low Fowler position, which maximizes diaphragmatic chest expansion. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring may be advisable, as well as supplemental oxygen therapy (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>) and frequent respiratory assessments (at least every shift). For the patient with a known diagnosis of OSA, ensuring that the patient utilizes prescribed therapy (e.g., oral appliance, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) if newly hospitalized or in a different transitional care environment is important in order to ensure breathing effectiveness and avoid respiratory failure (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3185">Haesler, 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Holsworth &#x0026; Gallagher, 2017</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Petcu, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with obesity may have central and peripheral circulatory compromise. Heart failure is more commonplace among patients with obesity (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). Hypertension is also more prevalent; the nurse must use appropriately sized blood pressure cuffs to obtain valid blood pressure readings (see <a href="c27.xhtml">Chapter 27</a>). Peripheral blood flow can be compromised for the patient with obesity, resulting in stasis of blood flow, one of three components of the Virchow triad, which is the broad category of risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, <a href="c26-sec14.xhtml#ct26-8">Chart 26-8</a>). Peripheral circulatory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1353" title="1353"></span>compromise not only can increase the risk for VTE formation (e.g., pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis [DVT]), but it can also make finding venous access difficult when the patient with obesity requires intravenous (IV) therapy. Finding appropriate venous access can be exacerbated by the presence of increased adipose tissue in the extremities. Ultrasound guidance may be required in order to successfully gain IV access and place an IV cannula in the patient with obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3216">Oliver, Oliver, Ohanyan, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with obesity may have differences in both pharmacokinetics (i.e., the movement of drug metabolites within the body) and pharmacodynamics (i.e., how drugs are metabolized and the effects of drugs) that can affect drug dosages, drug effectiveness, and patient safety. The effectiveness of many drugs is affected by the ratio of lean skeletal muscle mass to adipose tissue. The active metabolites of many drugs are protein bound in the plasma. In patients with greater adipose tissue, more of these active metabolites can be unbound in plasma, or free, and exert greater effects. Some drugs readily bind to adipose tissue, which may either inactivate them or prolong their effects. In addition, increased adiposity can have indirect effects on metabolic pathways within the liver, resulting in changes in drug metabolic pathways, which can result in either increased or decreased drug metabolism, depending on the drug and the affected metabolic pathway. In other words, some drugs have enhanced effects while others have diminished effects with patients with obesity compared to patients of normal weight. For instance, research studies have found that patients with obesity who are critically ill with sepsis require proportionally lower dosages of IV drip norepinephrine, which is typically given based on weight-based calculations, than patients with normal weight (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Droege &#x0026; Ernst, 2017</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Radosevich, Patanwala, &#x0026; Erstad, 2016</a>). On the other hand, patients with obesity who require opioid agents to treat pain frequently require higher dosages of opioid agents to achieve pain relief, but are more likely to have serious adverse effects of sedation and respiratory depression (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3207">Meisenberg, Ness, Rao, et al., 2017</a>). The nurse should be cognizant that weight-based calculations of drug dosages for patients with obesity may need to be altered, depending on the patient and the drug, and should consult with clinical pharmacologists and the patient&#x2019;s primary provider as needed to ensure optimal drug effectiveness and patient safety.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with obesity are particularly vulnerable to developing pressure injuries (see <a href="#ct42-5">Chart 42-5</a>). Increased adipose tissue can diminish the supply of blood, oxygen, and nutrients <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1354" title="1354"></span>to peripheral tissue. The presence of more folds in the skin is associated with more skin moisture and increased skin friction, which are pressure injury risks. Moreover, skin folds may be present in uncommon areas, including under the breasts, under the lower abdomen, within gluteal folds, and at the nape of the neck (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3185">Haesler, 2018</a>; <a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Williamson, 2020</a>). In addition, patients with obesity frequently have more limitations in mobility than patients of normal weight. Immobility is another risk for pressure injury development (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3256">Williamson, 2020</a>). Consultation with a wound-ostomy-continence (WOC) nurse may be advisable to ensure that pressure injury risks for the patient with obesity are minimized.</p>

</div>
<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>When Is Prescribed Care Beneficent and When Is It Paternalistic?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">T.N. is a 40-year-old woman admitted to the hospital 2 days ago for treatment of nonhealing and infected stage III pressure injuries. T.N. is 64 inches tall and weighs 275 pounds; thus, her BMI is 47.2&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, consistent with Class III/severe obesity. T.N. has had obesity since childhood and reportedly has not been willing to listen to her family practice primary provider&#x2019;s repeated cautions to increased physical activity and decreased caloric dietary intake. The admitting primary provider has prescribed wound d&#x00E9;bridement, intravenous antibiotics, and a diet restricted to 1000 calories daily during her hospitalization. You are a staff nurse on the unit where T.N. has been admitted and are assigned to care for her. During oncoming shift report, you hear that staff members suspect T.N. is somehow having additional food brought into her room. During your initial assessment of T.N. she says to you &#x201C;This hospital food is terrible. It tastes bad and I am not getting nearly enough to eat.&#x201D; The charge nurse suggests that T.N.&#x2019;s visitors could be screened to discourage them from bringing T.N. outside food and to assist T.N. to adhere to the therapeutic regime to help facilitate healing.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients with severe obesity are at risk for pressure injuries. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that T.N.&#x2019;s overall health status will improve with weight reduction. Furthermore, it is common practice that patients are placed on dietary restrictions while hospitalized. For instance, patients with hypertension are typically prescribed low sodium diets. There are some bioethicists and clinicians who argue that patients should consent to such restrictions, and that placing patients on dietary restriction smacks of paternalism (i.e., &#x201C;father knows best&#x201D;). Others would argue that dietary restrictions are part of the holistic health care plan that benefits patients who are hospitalized.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Does T.N. have the autonomous right to not adhere to her prescribed diet? Is it reasonable to enforce a caloric restriction on her while she is being hospitalized? Should her visitors be subjected to requests that they not bring her food, or does that breach the confidentiality of her treatment plan?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Does placing T.N. on a calorie restricted diet during her hospitalization benefit her? If she does lose weight while she is hospitalized, might that accelerate the healing of her pressure injuries? Or might she become malnourished? Do a risk analysis. Are there more potential risks or more potential benefits entailed with this prescribed diet?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>T.N. has reportedly been resistant to changing her habits. It is not known whether or not her motivation to lose weight has ever been assessed; yet, patients with severe obesity must be motivated to make changes in order to successfully manage their disease. Assume that her motivation is assessed and that she is motivated and ready to lose weight. What are the next steps? Admonishing her that she should adhere to the prescribed diet? Or are there other resources that might be mobilized to assist her to successfully manage her disease?</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse must ensure that appropriate specialty equipment is utilized as needed so that the patient with obesity who is immobilized is turned and mobilized as indicated to prevent pressure injuries. For many years, the traditional nursing protocol was that the patient who is immobilized and bedfast should be turned every 2 hours to prevent pressure injuries; that is now updated so that more frequent patient movements are encouraged, particularly in the patient with obesity (<a href="c42-sec02.xhtml#bib3185">Haesler, 2018</a>). Nurses should be familiar with and comfortable using specialized durable medical bariatric equipment (e.g., lifts, transport equipment, commodes) so that the patient with obesity receives necessary care. It is also important to enforce and implement safe patient handling protocols so that the nurse does not incur musculoskeletal injury.</p>
