<h4 class="h4a" id="s2143"><strong>KIDNEY DISEASE</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Kidney disease results when the kidneys cannot remove the body&#x2019;s metabolic wastes or perform their regulatory functions. The substances normally eliminated in the urine accumulate in the body fluids as a result of impaired renal excretion, affecting endocrine and metabolic functions as well as resulting in fluid, electrolyte, and acid&#x2013;base disturbances. Kidney disease is a systemic disease and a final common pathway of many different kidney and urinary tract diseases. The impact of kidney failure in the United States continues to increase due to the aging of the U.S. population and the increasing incidence of obesity and diabetes (USRDS, 2019).</p>
