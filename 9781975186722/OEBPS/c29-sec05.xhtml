The term is used when the hematocrit is elevated (more than 55% in males and 50% in females). Dehydration can cause elevated hematocrit but not usually to the level seen with polycythemia. Polycythemia is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary polycythemia, also known as polycythemia vera, is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that is discussed in Chapter 30.</p>
