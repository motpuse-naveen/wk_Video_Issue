<h4 class="h4" id="s2182">Management of Patients Undergoing Kidney Surgery</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2183">Preoperative Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery is performed only after a thorough evaluation of renal function. Patient preparation to ensure that optimal renal function is maintained is essential. Fluids are encouraged to promote increased excretion of waste products before surgery unless contraindicated because of preexisting renal or cardiac dysfunction. If kidney infection is present preoperatively, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be prescribed to prevent bacteremia. Antibiotic agents must be given with extreme care because many are toxic to the kidneys. Coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count) may be indicated if the patient has a history of bruising and bleeding. The preoperative preparation is similar to that described in <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Because many patients facing kidney surgery are apprehensive, the nurse encourages the patient to recognize and verbalize concerns. Confidence is reinforced by establishing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1592" title="1592"></span>a relationship of trust and by providing expert care. Patients faced with the prospect of losing a kidney may think that they will have to depend on dialysis for the rest of their lives. The nurse reassures the patient and family that normal renal function can be maintained by a single healthy kidney.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2184">Perioperative Concerns</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Kidney surgery requires various patient positions to expose the surgical site adequately. Three surgical approaches are common: flank, lumbar, and thoracoabdominal (see <a href="#ff48-8">Fig.&#x00A0;48-8</a>A&#x2013;C). Laparoscopic urologic surgery is often performed as a less invasive option than open surgery (see <a href="#ff48-8">Fig.&#x00A0;48-8</a>D). During surgery, plans are carried out for managing altered urinary drainage. These may include inserting a nephrostomy or other drainage tube.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2185">Postoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because the kidney is a highly vascular organ, hemorrhage and shock are the chief potential complications of kidney surgery. Fluid and blood component replacement is frequently necessary in the immediate postoperative period to treat intraoperative blood loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Abdominal distention and paralytic ileus may occur after renal and ureteral surgery and are thought to be due to a reflex paralysis of intestinal peristalsis and manipulation of the colon or duodenum during surgery. Abdominal distention is relieved by decompression through a nasogastric tube. See <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> for treatment of paralytic ileus. Oral fluids are permitted when the passage of flatus is noted.</p>
<p class="indent">If infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed after a culture reveals the causative organism. The toxic effects that antibiotic agents have on the kidneys (nephrotoxicity) must be kept in mind when assessing the patient. Low-dose heparin therapy may be initiated postoperatively to prevent thromboembolism in patients who have had any type of urologic surgery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2186">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to those interventions listed in this section, <a href="#ct48-13">Chart&#x00A0;48-13</a> provides a plan of nursing care for the patient undergoing kidney surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Providing Immediate Postoperative Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Immediate postoperative care of the patient who has undergone kidney surgery includes assessment of all body systems. Respiratory and circulatory status, pain level, fluid and electrolyte status, and patency and adequacy of urinary drainage systems are assessed.</p>
<p class="h7">Respiratory Status</p>
<p class="nonindent">As with any surgery, the use of anesthesia increases the risk of respiratory complications. Noting the location of the surgical incision assists the nurse in anticipating respiratory problems and pain. Respiratory status is assessed by monitoring the rate, depth, and pattern of respirations. The location of the incision frequently causes pain on inspiration and coughing; therefore, the patient tends to splint the chest wall and take shallow respirations. Auscultation is performed to assess normal and adventitious breath sounds.</p>
<p class="h7">Circulatory Status and Blood Loss</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient&#x2019;s vital signs and arterial or central venous pressure are monitored. Skin color and temperature and urine output provide information about circulatory status. The surgical incision and drainage tubes are observed frequently to help detect unexpected blood loss and hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="h7">Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative pain is a major problem for the patient because of the location of the surgical incision and patient&#x2019;s position on the operating table to permit access to the kidney. The location and severity of pain are assessed before and after analgesic medications are given. Abdominal distention, which increases discomfort, is also noted.</p>
<p class="h7">Urinary Drainage</p>
<p class="nonindent">Urine output and drainage from tubes inserted during surgery are monitored for amount, color, and type or characteristics. Decreased or absent drainage is promptly reported to the primary provider because it may indicate obstruction that could cause pain, infection, and disruption of the suture lines.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bleeding is a major complication of kidney surgery. If undetected and untreated, it can result in hypovolemia and hemorrhagic shock. The nurse&#x2019;s role is to observe for these complications, to report their signs and symptoms, and to administer prescribed parenteral fluids and blood and blood components. Monitoring of vital signs, skin condition, the urinary drainage system, the surgical incision, and the level of consciousness is necessary to detect evidence of bleeding, decreased circulating blood, and fluid volume and cardiac output. Frequent monitoring of vital signs (initially monitored at least at hourly intervals) and urinary output is necessary for early detection of these complications.</p>
<p class="indent">If bleeding goes undetected or is not detected promptly, the patient may lose significant amounts of blood and may experience hypoxemia. In addition to hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage, this type of blood loss may precipitate a myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack. Bleeding may be suspected when the patient experiences fatigue and shortness of breath and when urine output is less than 400&#x00A0;mL within 24 hours. As bleeding persists, late signs of hypovolemia occur, such as cool skin, flat neck veins, and change in level of consciousness or responsiveness. Transfusions of blood components are indicated, along with surgical repair of the bleeding vessel.</p>
<p class="indent">Pneumonia may be prevented through the use of an incentive spirometer, adequate pain control, and early ambulation. Early signs of pneumonia include fever, increased heart and respiratory rates, and adventitious breath sounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Preventing infection involves using asepsis when changing dressings and handling and preparing catheters, other drainage tubes, central venous catheters, and IV catheters for administration of fluids. Insertion sites are monitored closely for signs and symptoms of inflammation: redness, drainage, heat, and pain. Special care must be taken to prevent UTI, which is associated with the use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheters and other invasive tubes are removed as soon as they are no longer needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotics are commonly given postoperatively to prevent infection. If antibiotic agents are prescribed, serum creatinine and BUN values must be monitored closely because many antibiotic agents are toxic to the kidney or can accumulate to toxic levels if renal function is compromised.</p>
<p class="indent">Preventing fluid imbalance is critical when caring for a patient undergoing kidney surgery, because both fluid loss and fluid excess are possible adverse effects of the surgery. Fluid loss may occur during surgery as a result of excessive urinary drainage when the obstruction is removed, or it may occur if diuretic agents are used. Such loss may also occur with GI losses, with diarrhea resulting from antibiotic use, or with nasogastric drainage. When postoperative IV therapy is inadequate to match the output or fluids lost, a fluid deficit results. Fluid excess, or overload, may result from cardiac effects of anesthesia, administration of excessive amounts of fluids, or the patient&#x2019;s inability to excrete fluid because of changes in renal function. Decreased urine output may be an indication of fluid excess.</p>
<p class="indent">Astute assessment skills are needed to detect early signs of fluid excess (such as weight gain, pedal edema, urine output below 400 mL/day, and slightly elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure if available) before they become severe (appearance of adventitious breath sounds, shortness of breath).</p>
<p class="indent">Fluid excess may be treated with fluid restriction and administration of furosemide or other diuretic agents. If renal insufficiency is present, these medications may prove ineffective; therefore, dialysis may be necessary to prevent heart failure and pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="indent">Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may occur postoperatively because of surgical manipulation of the iliac vessels during surgery or prolonged immobility. Anti-embolism stockings are applied, and the patient is monitored closely for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and encouraged to exercise the legs. Heparin or other anticoagulants may be given postoperatively to reduce the risk of thrombosis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient has a drainage system in place, measures are taken to ensure that both the patient and family understand the importance of maintaining the system correctly at home and preventing infection. Verbal and written instructions and guidelines are provided to the patient and family at the time of hospital discharge. The patient may be asked to demonstrate or &#x201C;teach back&#x201D; management of the drainage system to validate understanding (see <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> for further discussion of the teach-back technique). Strategies to prevent postoperative complications (urinary tract obstruction and infection, DVT, atelectasis, and pneumonia) are stressed to the patient and family. With both the patient and family, the nurse reviews the signs, symptoms, problems, and questions that should be referred to the physician or other primary provider.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The need for postoperative assessment and care after kidney surgery continues regardless of the setting: the home, subacute care unit, outpatient clinic or office, or rehabilitation facility. Referral for home care is indicated for the patient who is going home with a urinary drainage system in place. During the home visit, the home health nurse reviews the instructions and guidelines given to the patient at hospital discharge. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s ability to carry out the instructions in the home and answers questions that the patient or family has about management of the drainage system and the surgical incision.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the home health nurse obtains vital signs and assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of urinary tract obstruction and infection. The nurse also ensures that pain is adequately controlled and that the patient is adhering to recommendations. The home health nurse encourages adequate fluid intake and increased levels of activity. Together, the nurse, patient, and family review the signs, symptoms, problems, and questions that should be referred to the primary provider. If the patient has a drainage tube in place, the nurse assesses the site and the patency of the system and monitors the patient for complications, such as DVT, bleeding, or pneumonia.</p>
<p class="indent">Because it is easy for the patient, family, and health care team to focus on the patient&#x2019;s immediate disorder to the exclusion of other health issues, the nurse reminds the patient and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1596" title="1596"></span>family about the importance of participating in health promotion activities, including appropriate health screenings.</p>
