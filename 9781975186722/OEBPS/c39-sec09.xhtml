<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gastrostomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical creation of an opening into the stomach for the purpose of administering fluids, nutrition formulas, and medications or for decompression and drainage of stomach contents">gastrostomy</button></strong> is a procedure in which an opening is created into the stomach either for the purpose of administering nutrition, fluids, and medications via a feeding tube, or for gastric decompression in patients with gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or intestinal obstruction. A gastrostomy is preferred over a nasally inserted tube to deliver enteral nutrition support longer than 4 to 6 weeks (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2877">Bischoff et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Gastrostomy is also preferred over nasogastric or orogastric feedings in the patient who is comatose because the gastroesophageal sphincter remains intact, making regurgitation and aspiration less likely. Placement involves creation of a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stoma:&lt;/b&gt; artificially created opening between a body cavity (e.g., stomach or intestine) and the body surface">stoma</button></strong>, an artificially created opening, that houses the tube.</p>
<p class="indent">Insertion of a <strong>percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)</strong> requires the services of a provider skilled in endoscopy, utilizes moderate sedation, and takes approximately 15 to 20&#x00A0;minutes. A lighted endoscope is inserted through the mouth into the stomach. Once in the stomach, the light indicates the location for hollow needle and guidewire insertion into the stomach. The wire is pulled back through the mouth, then the PEG tube itself is attached to the wire to guide the PEG tube as it moves into the mouth, down the esophagus, into the stomach, and out the incision in the abdominal wall. An internal fixation bolster, often called a <em>bumper</em>, is pulled snug against the stomach wall. An external retention disc/phalange sits close to the abdominal surface. The tension between the external and internal fixation bolsters keeps the tube in place (see <a href="#ff39-8">Fig. 39-8</a>A). A radiologically inserted gastrostomy tube (RIG) can be placed fluoroscopically by a skilled provider when an endoscope cannot be passed through a strictured or obstructed esophagus. The RIG is internally sutured and held in place by an internal balloon that is inflated with a small amount of water (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Anderson, 2019</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Thompson, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Feeding can be initiated via PEG tubes within several hours (&#x2264;4 hours) of placement. The stomal tract will take 30 to 90 days to mature, so replacement should not occur until at least 30 days after placement. Manufacturer guidelines should be followed for replacement of tubes, but deterioration or dysfunction, a ruptured balloon, stomal tract disruption, nonhealing ulcers, or fistula formation may accelerate this recommended time frame. With optimal care, tubes may last 1 to 2 years; however, most policies encourage preventative maintenance that includes elective changing of the balloon gastrostomy tube every 3 to 6 months (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). An alternative to standard gastrostomy tubes that are bulky are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1250" title="1250"></span>low-profile gastrostomy devices (see <a href="#ff39-8">Fig. 39-8</a>B). Specific types of low-profile gastrostomy devices include the MIC-KEY or the Bard Button. These devices are flush with the skin, eliminate the possibility of inward tube migration, have antireflux valves to prevent gastric leakage, and do not require tape or other securement devices (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Patients requiring enteral nutrition support can conceal the feeding tube access site under their clothing. Low-profile gastrostomy devices require special connection tubing so they can be attached to the feeding container. Patients must be instructed to bring this connection tubing with them when traveling, going to the emergency department or hospital, or undergoing diagnostic procedures that require access into the GI tract.</p>

<p class="indent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;jejunostomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical creation of an opening into the jejunum for the purpose of administering fluids, nutrition formulas, and medications">jejunostomy</button></strong> is a surgically, endoscopically (percutaneous gastrojejunostomy or jejunal; PEJ), or radiologically placed opening into the jejunum for the purpose of administering nutrition, fluids, and medications. A jejunostomy tube is indicated when the gastric route is not accessible, or to decrease aspiration risk when the stomach is not functioning adequately to process and empty food and fluids. These tubes either have an internal balloon or dacron cuff, or are sutured externally to secure them. Unlike the gastrostomy tubes, jejunostomy tubes should not be rotated and only last between 6 to 9 months (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Anderson, 2019</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The small intestine can also be accessed by placing a jejunal extension tube through an existing gastrostomy tube and manipulating it through the pylorus into the small intestine endoscopically, fluoroscopically, or during a surgical procedure&#x2014;this is referred to as a <em>gastrojejunostomy</em> tube.</p>

<p class="processppara">The focus of the preoperative assessment is to determine the patient&#x2019;s ability to understand and cooperate with the procedure. The nurse assesses the ability of both patient and family to adjust to a change in body image and to participate in self-care. There are multiple medical and ethical issues that the patient, the caregivers, and the primary provider should discuss together.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The purpose of the procedure and expected postoperative course should be explained. The patient needs to know that the feeding tube will bypass the mouth and esophagus so that liquid feedings can be given directly into the stomach or intestine. If the feeding tube is expected to be permanent, the patient should be made aware of this. If the procedure is being performed to relieve discomfort, prolonged vomiting, debilitation, or an inability to eat, the patient may find the feeding tube more acceptable.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">In the postoperative period, the patient&#x2019;s fluid and nutritional needs are assessed to ensure proper intake and GI function. The nurse inspects the tube for proper maintenance and the incision for any drainage, skin breakdown, or signs of infection. As the nurse evaluates patients&#x2019; responses to the change in body image and their understanding of the feeding methods, interventions are identified to help them cope with the tube and learn self-care measures.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Impaired nutritional status</p>

<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2963">Anderson, 2019</a>):</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1rFirst"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Wound infection, cellulitis, and leakage</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1251" title="1251"></span>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient may include achieving nutritional requirements, preventing infection, maintaining skin integrity, adjusting to changes in body image, and preventing complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>EETING</small> N<small>UTRITIONAL</small> N<small>EEDS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The first fluid nourishment is given soon after tube insertion and can consist of a sterile water or normal saline flush of at least 30 mL. Formula feeding can begin as prescribed, typically within 4 hours post tube insertion. The infusion rate or bolus amount given is gradually increased.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the tube has been placed for gastric drainage, it can be connected to either low intermittent suction or to a gravity drainage bag. This drainage should be measured and recorded because it is a significant indicator of GI function. A decrease in the amount of drainage may indicate that the tube can be clamped for periods of time, allowing greater freedom of movement. High output can result in significant fluid and electrolyte losses.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REVENTING</small> I<small>NFECTION AND</small> P<small>ROVIDING</small> S<small>KIN</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">For the first week after insertion, interventions are focused on prevention of stomal tract infection and promotion of incisional healing. The insertion site should be kept clean and dry using aseptic wound care daily and/or a glycerin hydrogel or glycogel dressing. It is normal to see scant serous drainage at the site for a few days post insertion. After approximately 1 week, the site (including under the external disc, if one is present) can be cleansed twice a week with soap and water and left open to air. Skin at the exit site is evaluated daily for signs of breakdown, irritation, excoriation, and the presence of drainage, bleeding or hypertrophic tissue growth or scattered, raised red papules that could indicate a yeast or candidal infection. Candida may appear in warm moist areas of the body; the area beneath the gastric tube external retention bolster is a common location for it to develop and spread. The nurse encourages the patient and family members to participate in this evaluation and in hygiene activities. If gastric contents leak and irritate the skin at the stoma site, zinc oxide&#x2013;based protectants may be used. After the first week of healing, buried bumper syndrome, a severe, but rare complication, can be prevented by rotating the gastric tube (not done with jejunostomy tubes) daily and moving the tube inward 2 to 10 cm at least once a week (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2877">Bischoff et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>; <a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>E<small>NHANCING</small> B<small>ODY</small> I<small>MAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Eating is a major physiologic and social function, and the patient with a gastrostomy has experienced a major change in body image. The patient is also aware that gastrostomy as a therapeutic intervention is performed only in the presence of a major, chronic, or perhaps terminal illness. It is necessary to evaluate the existing family support system because adjustment takes time and is facilitated by family acceptance.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">During the postoperative course, the most common complications are wound infection or cellulitis at the exit site, bleeding, leakage, excessive tightness of external retention bolster, and dislodgement. Because many patients who receive tube feedings are debilitated and have compromised nutritional status, any signs of infection are promptly reported to the primary provider so that appropriate therapy can be instituted. Bleeding from the insertion site in the stomach can also occur and should be reported promptly. The nurse closely monitors the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and observes all operative site drainage, vomitus, and stool for evidence of bleeding. If an external retention bolster, tape, securement device, or sutures are present, they are evaluated for adequate tension and securement. Excessive tension of the external retention bolster can cause excruciating pain and will lead to skin breakdown and ulceration. The nurse should notify the primary provider if excessive pain occurs at the incision site post insertion.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Dislodgement of a recently inserted tube requires immediate attention because the tract can close within 4 to 6 hours if the tube is not replaced promptly. Aspiration is a potential risk with tube dislodgment, especially with nasally inserted tubes. The head of bed for the patient should be elevated to at least 30 degrees. Careful assessment of external tube markings that could suggest drift in placement, and of the patient for signs and symptoms of fullness or nausea that might lead to gastric reflux are important strategies that may prevent aspiration (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Tube occlusion/clogging occurs in 23% to 35% of patients with feeding tubes and can lead to delays in feeding and medication administration (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Prevention is important and can be accomplished by administering adequate and frequent flushes as previously described. If a tube does become clogged, warm water may be instilled into the enteral nutrition device with a 30- to 60-mL syringe, followed by a gentle pulling and pushing on the plunger. If this method does not resolve the obstruction, an enzyme-containing commercially available declogging kit may be used or a combination of a pancreatic enzyme tablet and a bicarbonate tablet may be used (<a href="c39-sec20.xhtml#bib2879">Boullata et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="drop" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yellow">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The patient with a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube in the home setting must be capable of maintaining patency of the tube or have a caregiver who can do so. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s level of knowledge and interest in learning about the tube, as well as an ability to understand how to flush, provide site care, and administer feedings or facilitate decompression and drainage. Education is similar to that described earlier. To facilitate self-care, the nurse encourages the patient to participate in flushing the tube, administering medications and tube feedings during hospitalization, and establishing as normal a routine as possible.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Adapters are available that can be secured to the end of the tube to create a &#x201C;Y&#x201D; site for ease of flushing, suction, or medication delivery. The flushing equipment is cleaned with warm, soapy water and rinsed after each use. The tube can be marked at skin level to provide the patient with a baseline for later comparison. The patient or caregiver should be advised <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1252" title="1252"></span>to monitor the tube&#x2019;s length and to notify the primary provider or home care nurse if the segment of the tube outside the body becomes shorter or longer.</p>

<p class="SPH1" id="sec11">DISORDERS OF THE ESOPHAGUS</p>
<p class="nonindent">The esophagus is a mucus-lined, muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It begins at the base of the pharynx and ends about 4 cm below the diaphragm. Its ability to transport food and fluid is facilitated by two sphincters. The upper esophageal sphincter, also called the <em>hypopharyngeal sphincter,</em> is located at the junction of the pharynx and the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter, also called the <em>gastroesophageal sphincter</em> or <em>cardiac sphincter,</em> is located at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach. An incompetent lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux (backward flow) of gastric contents. Because there is no serosal layer of the esophagus, if surgery is necessary, it is more difficult to perform suturing or anastomosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Disorders of the esophagus include motility disorders (achalasia, spasms), hiatal hernias, diverticula, perforation, foreign bodies, chemical burns, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett esophagus (BE), benign tumors, and carcinoma. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1253" title="1253"></span>Dysphagia, the most common symptom of esophageal disease, may vary from an uncomfortable feeling that a bolus of food is caught in the upper esophagus to acute <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;odynophagia:&lt;/b&gt; pain on swallowing">odynophagia</button></strong> (pain on swallowing). Obstruction of food (solid and soft) and even liquids may occur anywhere along the esophagus. Often, the patient can indicate that the problem is located in the upper, middle, or lower third of the esophagus.</p>
