<p class="nonindent">Other than cholesteatoma, masses in the middle ear are rare. Glomus tympanicum is a tumor that arises from Jacobson nerve (in the temporal bone of the skull) and remains limited to the middle ear. On otoscopy, a red blemish on or behind the tympanic membrane is seen. Glomus jugulare tumors are rarely malignant; however, because of their location, treatment may be necessary to relieve symptoms. The treatment is surgical excision, except in patients who are poor surgical candidates, in whom radiation therapy is used.</p>
<p class="indent">A facial nerve neuroma is a tumor on cranial nerve VII. These types of tumors are usually not visible on otoscopic examination but are suspected when a patient presents with a facial nerve paresis. X-ray evaluation is used to identify the site of the tumor along the facial nerve. The treatment is surgical removal.</p>
