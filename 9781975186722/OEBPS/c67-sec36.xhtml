<h4 class="h4" id="s3249">Ingested (Swallowed) Poisons</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Swallowed poisons may be corrosive. <strong>Corrosive poisons</strong> include alkaline and acid agents that can cause tissue destruction after coming in contact with mucous membranes. Alkaline products include lye, drain cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2203" title="2203"></span>bleach, nonphosphate detergents, oven cleaners, and button batteries (batteries used to power watches, calculators, hearing aids, or cameras). Acid products include toilet bowl cleaners, pool cleaners, metal cleaners, rust removers, and battery acid.</p>
<p class="indent">Control of the airway, ventilation, and oxygenation are essential. In the absence of cerebral or renal damage, the patient&#x2019;s prognosis depends largely on successful management of respiration and circulation. Measures are instituted to stabilize cardiovascular and other body functions. ECG, vital signs, and neurologic status are monitored closely for changes. Shock may result from the cardiodepressant action of the substance ingested, from venous pooling in the lower extremities, or from reduced circulating blood volume resulting from increased capillary permeability (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to monitor kidney function. Blood specimens are obtained to determine the concentration of drug or poison (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">Efforts are made to determine what substance was ingested; the amount; the time since ingestion; signs and symptoms, such as pain or burning sensations, any evidence of redness or burn in the mouth or throat, pain on swallowing or an inability to swallow, vomiting, or drooling; age and weight of the patient; and pertinent health history.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The local poison control center should be called if an unknown toxic agent has been taken or if it is necessary to identify an antidote for a known toxic agent.</em></p></div>

<p class="indent">Measures are instituted to remove the toxin or decrease its absorption. If there is a specific chemical or physiologic antagonist (antidote), it is given as early as possible to reverse or diminish the effects of the toxin. If this measure is ineffective, procedures may be initiated to remove or dilute the ingested substance. These procedures include administration of multiple doses of activated charcoal, dialysis, or hemoperfusion. Hemoperfusion involves detoxification of the blood by processing it through an extracorporeal circuit and an adsorbent cartridge containing charcoal or resin, after which the cleansed blood is returned to the patient (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who has ingested a corrosive poison, which can be a strong acid or alkaline substance, is given water or milk to drink for dilution. However, dilution is not attempted if the patient has acute airway edema or obstruction; potential for vomiting; or if there is clinical evidence of esophageal, gastric, or intestinal burn or perforation. The following gastric emptying procedures may be used as prescribed:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Gastric lavage for the patient who is obtunded is only useful within 1 hour of ingestion, for sustained-release substances, or massive life-threatening amounts of a substance; however, complications of aspiration and stomach or esophageal perforation outweigh its usefulness. If performed, gastric aspirate is saved and sent to the laboratory for testing (toxicology screens).</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Activated charcoal administration if the poison is one that is absorbed by charcoal; given orally or by nasogastric tube, it is effective in small intermittent doses to decrease vomiting. It should be diluted as a slurry so that it is easier to drink or pass through the nasogastric tube. Activated charcoal absorbs most commonly ingested poisons except corrosives, heavy metals and hydrocarbons, iron, and lithium.</p>
<p class="indent">Cathartics, which had traditionally accompanied the use of activated charcoal, are rarely indicated because they can result in severe electrolyte imbalances, diarrhea, and hypovolemia (ENA, 2020a). Furthermore, syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting in the patient who is alert is not recommended due to the risk of aspiration and should <em>never</em> be used with corrosive poisons or with petroleum distillates (e.g., lubricating oil, fuel oil) or further corrosive damage to the upper airway and pharyngeal structures may occur.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Vomiting is never induced after ingestion of caustic substances (acid or alkaline) or petroleum distillates.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Throughout detoxification, the patient&#x2019;s vital signs, CVP, and fluid and electrolyte balance are monitored closely. Hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias are possible. Seizures are also possible because of CNS stimulation from the poison or from oxygen deprivation. If the patient complains of pain, analgesic agents are given cautiously. Severe pain causes vasomotor collapse and reflex inhibition of normal physiologic functions.</p>
<p class="indent">After the patient&#x2019;s condition has stabilized and discharge is imminent, written material should be given to the patient indicating the signs and symptoms of potential problems related to the poison ingested and signs or symptoms requiring evaluation by a health care provider. If poisoning was determined to be a suicide or self-harm attempt, a psychiatric consultation should be requested before the patient is discharged. In cases of inadvertent poison ingestion, poison prevention and home poison-proofing instructions should be provided to the patient and family.</p>
