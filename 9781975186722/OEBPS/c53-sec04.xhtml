<h4 class="h4a" id="s2504">DISORDERS OF MALE SEXUAL FUNCTION</h4>
<h4 class="h4a" id="s2505">Erectile Dysfunction</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Erectile dysfunction</strong>, also called <em>impotence,</em> is the inability to achieve or maintain an erect penis (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Norris, 2019</a>). The man may report decreased frequency of erections, inability to achieve a firm erection, or rapid detumescence (subsiding of erection). In the United States, 30 million men experience erectile dysfunction; more than half of men 40 to 70 years of age are unable to attain or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3842">Smith, Howards, Preminger, et al., 2019</a>). The physiology of erection and ejaculation is complex and involves parasympathetic and sympathetic components. Erection involves the release of nitric oxide into the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. Its release activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), causing smooth muscle relaxation. This allows flow of blood into the corpus cavernosum, resulting in erection (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng, MacLennan, &#x0026; Bostwick, 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Erectile dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes. Psychogenic causes include anxiety, fatigue, depression, pressure to perform sexually, negative body image, absence of desire, and privacy, as well as trust and relationship issues. Organic causes include cardiovascular disease, endocrine disease (diabetes, pituitary tumors, testosterone deficiency, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism), cirrhosis, chronic kidney injury, genitourinary conditions (radical pelvic surgery), hematologic conditions (Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia), neurologic disorders (neuropathies, parkinsonism, spinal cord injury [SCI], multiple sclerosis), trauma to the pelvic or genital area, smoking, medications (see <a href="#ct53-1">Chart&#x00A0;53-1</a>), and substance use disorder.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2506">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction requires a sexual and medical history; an analysis of presenting symptoms; a physical examination, including a neurologic examination; a detailed assessment of all medications, alcohol, and drugs used; and various laboratory studies. Nocturnal penile tumescence tests are conducted to monitor changes in penile circumference. This test can help to determine if erectile dysfunction has an organic or a psychological cause. In healthy men, nocturnal penile erections closely parallel rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in occurrence and duration. Organically, men with erectile dysfunction show inadequate sleep-related erections that correspond to their waking performance. Arterial blood flow to the penis is measured using a Doppler probe. In addition, nerve conduction tests and extensive psychological evaluations may be carried out. <a href="#ff53-3">Figure&#x00A0;53-3</a> describes the evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2507">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment can be medical, surgical, or both, depending on the cause. Treatment of erectile dysfunction includes therapy for associated disorders (e.g., alcoholism, diabetes) or adjustment of medications (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">McMahon, 2019</a>). Endocrine therapy instituted to treat erectile dysfunction secondary to hypothalamic&#x2013;pituitary&#x2013;gonadal dysfunction may reverse the condition. Insufficient penile blood flow may be treated with vascular surgery. Patients with erectile dysfunction from psychogenic causes are referred to a health care provider or therapist who specializes in sexual dysfunction. Patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to organic causes may be candidates for penile implants.</p>

These options should be considered in a stepwise fashion, with increasing invasiveness and risk balanced against the likelihood of efficacy. The patient and, if possible, his partner, should be informed of the relevant treatment options and their associated risks and benefits. The choice of treatment is made jointly by the primary provider, patient, and partner, taking into consideration patient preferences and expectations.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (oral medications that are used to treat erectile dysfunction) are first-line therapy (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Allen, 2019</a>). Currently available PDE-5 inhibitors include sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Each of these agents has a similar mechanism of action but a different pharmacologic action and clinical use. Erection involves the release of nitric oxide in the vasculature of the corpus cavernosum as a result of sexual stimulation. This subsequently leads to smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased blood flow and an erection. During sexual stimulation, PDE-5 inhibitors increase blood flow to the penis (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When PDE-5 inhibitors are taken about 1 hour before sexual activity, they are effective in producing an erection with sexual stimulation; the erection can last about 1 to 2&#x00A0;hours. The most common side effects of these medications include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nasal congestion, and lightheadedness. These agents are contraindicated in men who take organic nitrates (e.g., isosorbide, nitroglycerin), because taken together, these medications can cause side effects such as severe hypotension (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Norris, 2019</a>). In addition, PDE-5 inhibitors must be used with caution in patients with retinopathy, especially in those with diabetic retinopathy. Patient education about the use of these medications and their side effects is summarized in <span class="chart"><a href="#tt53-3">Table&#x00A0;53-3</a></span>.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients in whom PDE-5 inhibitors are contraindicated or ineffective, other pharmacologic measures to induce erections include injecting vasoactive agents, such as alprostadil, papaverine, and phentolamine, directly into the penis. Complications include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;priapism:&lt;/b&gt; an uncontrolled, persistent erection of the penis from either neural or vascular causes, including medications, sickle cell thrombosis, leukemic cell infiltration, spinal cord tumors, and tumor invasion of the penis or its vessels">priapism</button></strong> (a persistent abnormal erection) and development of fibrotic plaques at the injection sites. Alprostadil is also formulated in a gel pellet that can be inserted into the tip of the urethra with an applicator to create an erection.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Penile Implants</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Two general types of penile implants are available: the malleable, noninflatable, nonhydraulic prosthesis (also called the <em>semirigid rod</em>) and the inflatable, hydraulic prostheses (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Lindsey, Lue, &#x0026; Shindel, 2020</a>). The semirigid rod (e.g., the Small&#x2013;Carrion prosthesis) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1751" title="1751"></span>results in a permanent semierection but can be bent into an unnoticeable position when appropriate. The inflatable prosthesis simulates natural erections and natural flaccidity. Complications after implantation include infection, erosion of the prosthesis through the skin (more common with the semirigid rod than with the inflatable prosthesis), and persistent pain, which may require removal of the implant. Subsequent cystoscopic surgery is more difficult with a semirigid rod than with the inflatable prosthesis.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Factors to consider in choosing a penile prosthesis are the patient&#x2019;s activities of daily living, social activities, and the expectations of the patient and his partner. Ongoing counseling for the patient and his partner is usually necessary to help them adapt to the prosthesis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Penis Transplants</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In the United States, a few medical centers have protocols for penis transplants. Candidates for transplantation include military veterans and other men who have suffered traumatic penile injuries. It is believed that men undergoing this surgery will have their ability to urinate and their sexual functioning restored (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3876">Ngaage, Elegbede, Sugarman, et al., 2020</a>). For more details on organ transplantation, see discussion in <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Negative-Pressure Devices</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Negative-pressure (vacuum) devices may also be used to induce an erection. A plastic cylinder is placed over the flaccid penis, and negative pressure is applied. When an erection is attained, a constriction band is placed around the base of the penis to maintain the erection. To avoid penile injury, the patient is instructed not to leave the constricting band in place for longer than 1 hour. Only devices with a vacuum limiter are recommended for use (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Sikka &#x0026; Hellstrom, 2017</a>). Although many men find this method satisfactory, others experience premature loss of penile rigidity or pain when applying suction or during sexual activity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2508">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Personal satisfaction and the ability to sexually satisfy a partner are common concerns of patients. Men with illnesses and disability may need the assistance of a sex therapist to identify, implement, and integrate their sexual beliefs and behaviors into a healthy and satisfying lifestyle. The nurse can inform patients about support groups for men with erectile dysfunction and their partners.</p>
