<h4 class="h4" id="s1404">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The musculoskeletal system provides protection for vital organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs; serves as a framework to support body structures; and makes mobility possible. Muscles and tendons hold the bones together, and joints allow the body to move. They also move to produce heat that helps maintain body temperature. Movement facilitates the return of deoxygenated blood to the right side of the heart by massaging the venous vasculature. The musculoskeletal system serves as a reservoir for immature blood cells and essential minerals, including calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and fluoride (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>). More than 98% of total-body calcium is present in bone (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1405">Structure and Function of the Skeletal System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are 206 bones in the human body, divided into four categories classified by their shape: long, short, flat, and irregular. The long bones are found in the upper and lower extremities (e.g., the femur). Long bones are shaped like rods or shafts with rounded ends (<a href="#ff35-1">Fig. 35-1</a>). The shaft, known as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;diaphysis:&lt;/b&gt; shaft of long bone">diaphysis</button></strong>, is primarily <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cortical bone:&lt;/b&gt; compact bone">cortical bone</button></strong> (compact bone). The ends of the long bones, called <strong>epiphyses</strong>, are primarily <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cancellous bone:&lt;/b&gt; latticelike bone structure; trabecular bone">cancellous bone</button></strong> (trabecular bone). During childhood and adolescence, there is a layer of cartilage known as the epiphyseal plate, or growth plate, that separates the epiphysis from the diaphysis. The epiphyseal plate nurtures and facilitates longitudinal growth. The epiphyseal plate is calcified in adults. The ends of long bones are covered at the joints by articular <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cartilage:&lt;/b&gt; tough, elastic, avascular tissue at ends of bone">cartilage</button></strong>, which is tough, elastic, and avascular tissue (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The short bones are the irregularly shaped bones located in the ankle and hand (e.g., metacarpals). The flat bones are located where extensive protection of underlying structures is needed (e.g., the sternum or skull). Finally, because of their shape, the irregular bones cannot be categorized in any other group and include bones such as the vertebrae and bones of the jaw.</p>
<p class="indent">The shape and construction of a specific bone are determined by its function and the forces exerted on it. Bones are constructed of cortical or cancellous bone tissue. Cortical bone exists in areas where support is needed, and cancellous bone is found where hematopoiesis and bone formation occur. For example, long bones are designed for weight bearing and movement and tend to be composed primarily of cortical bone, whereas flat bones, which are important sites of hematopoiesis and frequently protect vital organs, are made of cancellous bone layered between compact bone. Short bones consist of cancellous bone covered by a layer of cortical bone. Irregular bones have unique shapes related to their function. Generally, irregular bone structure is similar to that of flat bones (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Bone is composed of cells, protein matrix, and mineral deposits. The cells are of three basic types&#x2014;osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. <strong>Osteoblasts</strong> function in bone formation by secreting bone matrix. The matrix consists of collagen and ground substances (glycoproteins and proteoglycans) that provide a framework in which inorganic mineral salts are deposited. These minerals are primarily composed of calcium and phosphorus. <strong>Osteocytes</strong> are mature bone cells involved in bone maintenance; they are located in lacunae (bone matrix units). <strong>Osteoclasts</strong>, located in shallow Howship&#x2019;s lacunae (small pits in bones), are multinuclear cells involved in dissolving and resorbing bone. The microscopic functioning unit of mature cortical bone is the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteon:&lt;/b&gt; microscopic functional bone unit">osteon</button></strong>, or haversian system. The center of the osteon&#x2014;the haversian canal&#x2014;contains a capillary. Around the capillary are circles of mineralized bone matrix called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lamellae:&lt;/b&gt; mature compact bone structures that form concentric rings of bone matrix; lamellar bone">lamellae</button></strong>. Within the lamellae are lacunae that contain osteocytes. These are nourished through tiny structures called <em>canaliculi</em> (canals), which communicate with adjacent blood vessels within the haversian system. Lacunae in cancellous bone are layered in an irregular lattice network known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;trabeculae:&lt;/b&gt; latticelike bone structure; cancellous bone">trabeculae</button></strong>. Red bone marrow fills the lattice network. Capillaries nourish the osteocytes located in the lacunae (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Covering the bone is a dense, fibrous membrane known as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;periosteum:&lt;/b&gt; fibrous connective tissue covering bone">periosteum</button></strong>. This membranous structure nourishes bone and facilitates its growth. The periosteum contains nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics. It also provides for the attachment of tendons and ligaments (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;endosteum:&lt;/b&gt; a thin, vascular membrane covering the marrow cavity of long bones and the spaces in cancellous bone">endosteum</button></strong> is a thin, vascular membrane that covers the marrow cavity of long bones and the spaces in cancellous bone. Osteoclasts, which dissolve bone matrix to maintain the marrow cavity, are located near the endosteum in Howship&#x2019;s lacunae (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone marrow is a vascular tissue located in the medullary cavity (shaft) of long bones and in flat bones. Red bone marrow, located mainly in the sternum, ilium, vertebrae, and ribs in adults, is responsible for producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets through a process called <em>hematopoiesis.</em> In adults, the long bone is filled with fatty, yellow marrow (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Bone tissue is well vascularized. Cancellous bone receives a rich blood supply through metaphyseal and epiphyseal vessels. Periosteal vessels carry blood to compact bone through minute Volkmann canals. In addition, nutrient arteries penetrate the periosteum and enter the medullary cavity through foramina (small openings). Arteries supply blood to the marrow and bone. The venous system may accompany arteries or may exit independently (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bone Formation</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteogenesis:&lt;/b&gt; bone formation">Osteogenesis</button></strong> (bone formation) begins before birth. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ossification:&lt;/b&gt; process in which minerals (calcium) are deposited in bone matrix">Ossification</button></strong> is the process by which the bone matrix is formed and hard mineral crystals composed of calcium and phosphorus (e.g., hydroxyapatite) are bound to the collagen fibers. These mineral components give bone its characteristic strength, whereas the proteinaceous collagen gives bone its resilience (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bone Maintenance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bone is a dynamic tissue in a constant state of turnover. Throughout the lifespan, a process known as bone <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;remodeling:&lt;/b&gt; process that ensures bone maintenance through simultaneous bone resorption and formation">remodeling</button></strong> occurs, in which old bone is removed and new bone is added to the skeleton (formation). During childhood and the teenage years, new bone is added faster than old bone is removed; therefore, bones become larger, heavier, and denser. This continues until peak bone mass is reached, typically by age 20 years. Remodeling maintains bone structure and function through simultaneous resorption and osteogenesis, and as a result, complete skeletal turnover occurs every 10 years (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The balance between bone <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;resorption:&lt;/b&gt; removal/destruction of tissue, such as bone">resorption</button></strong> (removal or destruction) and formation is influenced by the following factors: physical activity; dietary intake of certain nutrients, especially calcium; and several hormones, including calcitriol (i.e., activated vitamin D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, thyroid hormone, cortisol, growth hormone, and the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Physical activity, particularly weight-bearing activity, acts to stimulate bone formation and remodeling. Bones subjected to continued weight bearing tend to be thick and strong. Conversely, people who are unable to engage in regular weight-bearing activities, such as those on prolonged bed rest or those with some physical disabilities, have increased bone resorption from calcium loss, and their bones become <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteopenic:&lt;/b&gt; refers to a reduction in bone mass to below-normal levels">osteopenic</button></strong> (reduced in terms of mass) and weak. These weakened bones may fracture easily (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Meiner &#x0026; Yeager, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Good dietary habits are integral to bone health. Daily intake of approximately 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium is essential to maintaining adult bone mass. Quality sources of calcium include low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. Foods with added calcium such as orange juice, cereals, and bread are also beneficial (NIH, 2019a). Vitamin D also plays a major role in calcium absorption and bone health. Young adults need a daily vitamin D intake of 600 IU, whereas adults 50 years and older require a daily intake of 800 to 1000 IU to ensure good bone health (NIH, 2019b). Dietary sources of vitamin D include vitamin D&#x2013;fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver.</p>
<p class="indent">Several hormones are vital in ensuring that calcium is properly absorbed and available for bone mineralization and matrix formation. Calcitriol functions to increase the amount of calcium in the blood by promoting absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract. It also facilitates mineralization of osteoid tissue. A deficiency of vitamin D results in bone mineralization deficit, deformity, and fracture (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">PTH and calcitonin are the major hormonal regulators of calcium homeostasis. PTH regulates the concentration of calcium in the blood, in part by promoting movement of calcium from the bone. In response to low calcium levels in the blood, increased levels of PTH prompt the mobilization of calcium, the demineralization of bone, and the formation of bone cysts. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland in response to elevated blood calcium levels, inhibits bone resorption and increases the deposit of calcium in bone (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Both thyroid hormone and cortisol have multiple systemic effects with specific effects on bones. Excessive thyroid hormone production in adults (e.g., Graves&#x2019; disease) can result in increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Increased levels of cortisol have these same effects. Patients receiving long-term synthetic cortisol or corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) are at increased risk for steroid-induced osteopenia and fractures.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1098</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1099" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1099">p. 1099</span></div>
<p class="indent">Growth hormone has direct and indirect effects on skeletal growth and remodeling. It stimulates the liver and, to a lesser degree, the bones to produce insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-I), which accelerates bone modeling in children and adolescents. Growth hormone also directly stimulates skeletal growth in children and adolescents. It is believed that the low levels of both growth hormone and IGF-I that occur with aging may be partly responsible for decreased bone formation and resultant osteopenia (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The sex hormones testosterone and estrogen have important effects on bone remodeling. Estrogen stimulates osteoblasts and inhibits osteoclasts; therefore, bone formation is enhanced and resorption is inhibited. Testosterone has both direct and indirect effects on bone growth and formation. It directly causes skeletal growth in adolescence and has continued effects on skeletal muscle growth throughout the lifespan. Increased muscle mass results in greater weight-bearing stress on bones, resulting in increased bone formation. In addition, testosterone converts to estrogen in adipose tissue, providing an additional source of bone-preserving estrogen for aging men (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Kennedy-Malone, Martin-Plank, &#x0026; Duffy, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During the process of bone remodeling, osteoblasts produce a receptor for activated nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) that binds to the receptor for activated nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) present on the cell membranes of osteoclast precursors, causing them to differentiate and mature into osteoclasts, which causes bone resorption. Conversely, osteoblasts may produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), which blocks the effects of RANKL, thereby turning off the process of bone resorption. T cells that may become activated as a result of the inflammatory process may also produce RANKL, overriding the effects of OPG and causing continued bone resorption during times of stress and injury, which can lead to loss of bone matrix and fractures (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2527">Takeno, Kanazawa, Notsu, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Blood supply to the bone also affects bone formation. With diminished blood supply or hyperemia (congestion), osteogenesis, and bone density decrease. Bone necrosis occurs when the bone is deprived of blood (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bone Healing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most fractures heal through a combination of intramembranous and endochondral ossification processes. When a bone is fractured, the bone begins a healing process to reestablish continuity and strength. The bone fragments are not patched together with scar tissue; instead, the bone regenerates itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Fracture healing occurs in the bone marrow, where endothelial cells rapidly differentiate into osteoblasts; in the bone cortex, where new osteons are formed; in the periosteum, where a hard <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;callus:&lt;/b&gt; cartilaginous/fibrous tissue at fracture site">callus</button></strong> (fibrous tissue) is formed through intramembranous ossification peripheral to the fracture, and where cartilage is formed through endochondral ossification adjacent to the fracture site; and in adjacent soft tissue, where a bridging callus forms that provides stability to the fractured bones (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When a fracture occurs, the body&#x2019;s response is similar to that after injury elsewhere in the body. The repair of a simple fracture occurs in essentially four stages. These include the following (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>):</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Stage I: Hematoma formation</em> occurs during the first 1 to 2 days of the fracture. Bleeding into the injured tissue and local vasoconstriction occur, and a hematoma forms at the site of the fracture. Cytokines are released, initiating the fracture healing processes by causing replicating cells known as fibroblasts to proliferate, which in turn causes angiogenesis to occur (i.e., the growth of new blood vessels). Granulation tissue begins to form within the clot and becomes dense. At the same time, degranulated platelets and inflammatory cells release growth factor, which stimulates the generation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Stage II: Inflammatory phase</em> occurs with the formation of granulation tissue. Fibroblasts and osteoblasts migrate into the fractured site and begin the reconstruction of bone. The fibroblasts produce a fibrocartilaginous soft callus bridge that connects the bone fragments. Although tissue repair may reach maximum girth by the end of the second or third week, it is still not strong enough for weight bearing.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Stage III: Reparative phase</em> usually begins during the third or fourth week of fracture healing and continues until a firm bony union is formed. During this stage, mature bone gradually replaces the fibrocartilaginous callus and the excess callus is gradually reabsorbed by the osteoclasts. During this stage, the fracture site feels immovable and appears aligned on x-ray. At this time, it is usually safe to remove a cast, if one is present.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Stage IV: Remodeling</em> occurs as necrotic bone is removed by the osteoclasts. Compact bone replaces spongy bone around the periphery of the fracture. Although the final structure of the remodeled bone resembles the original unbroken bone, a thickened area on the surface of the bone may remain after healing. Remodeling may take months to years, depending on the extent of bone modification needed, the function of the bone, and the functional stresses on the bone.</p>
<p class="indent">Serial x-rays are used to monitor the progress of bone healing. The type of bone fractured, the adequacy of blood supply, the condition of the fracture fragments, the immobility of the fracture site, and the age and general health of the person influence the rate of fracture healing. Adequate immobilization is essential until there is x-ray evidence of bone formation with ossification (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When fractures are treated with internal or external fixation techniques, the bony fragments can be placed in direct contact. Primary bone healing occurs through cortical bone (haversian) remodeling. Little or no cartilaginous callus develops. Immature bone develops from the endosteum. There is an intensive regeneration of new osteons, which develop in the fracture line by a process similar to normal bone maintenance. Fracture strength is obtained when the new osteons have become established (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1406">Structure and Function of the Articular System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The junction of two or more bones is called a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;joint:&lt;/b&gt; area where bone ends meet; provides for motion and flexibility">joint</button></strong>, or articulation. There are three basic kinds of joints: synarthrosis, amphiarthrosis, and diarthrosis joints. Synarthrosis joints, also referred to as fibrous joints, are immovable because of fibrous tissue banding (e.g., the skull sutures). Amphiarthrosis joints, also referred to as cartilaginous joints, allow limited motion (e.g., the vertebral joints and the symphysis pubis). Diarthrosis joints, also referred to as synovial joints, are freely movable joints (<a href="#ff35-2">Fig. 35-2</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1099</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1100" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1100">p. 1100</span></div>

<p class="indent">There are several types of diarthrosis joints:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Ball-and-socket joints</em> (e.g., the hip and the shoulder) permit full freedom of movement.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Hinge joints</em> permit bending in only one direction, either flexion or extension (e.g., the elbow and the knee).</span></li>
<li><span><em>Saddle joints</em> allow movement in two planes at right angles to each other. The joint at the base of the thumb is a saddle, biaxial joint.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Pivot joints</em> allow one bone to move around a central axis without displacement. An example of a pivot joint is the articulation between the radius and the ulna. They permit rotation for such activities as turning a doorknob.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Gliding joints</em> allow for limited movement in all directions and are represented by the joints of the carpal bones in the wrist.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The ends of the articulating bones of a typical movable joint are covered with smooth hyaline cartilage. A tough, fibrous sheath called the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;joint capsule:&lt;/b&gt; fibrous tissue that encloses bone ends and other joint surfaces">joint capsule</button></strong> surrounds the articulating bones. The capsule is lined with a membrane, the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;synovium:&lt;/b&gt; membrane in joint that secretes lubricating fluid">synovium</button></strong>, which secretes the lubricating and shock-absorbing synovial fluid into the joint capsule. Therefore, the bone surfaces are not in direct contact. In some synovial joints (e.g., the knee), fibrocartilage discs (e.g., medial meniscus) are located between the articular cartilage surfaces. These discs provide shock absorption (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Ligaments</strong> (ropelike bundles of collagen fibrils) bind the articulating bones together. <strong>Tendons</strong> are cords of fibrous tissue that connect muscle to bone. Ligaments and tendons, which pass over the joint, provide joint stability. In some joints, interosseous ligaments (e.g., the cruciate ligaments of the knee) are found within the capsule and add anterior and posterior stability to the joint. Ligaments are pliable enough to allow movement of the joints; however, they can tear rather than stretch if they are subjected to excess stress (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bursa:&lt;/b&gt; fluid-filled sac found in connective tissue, usually in the area of joints">bursa</button></strong> is a sac filled with synovial fluid that cushions the movement of tendons, ligaments, and bones over bones or other joint structures. Bursae can be found in the joints of the elbow, shoulder, hip, and knee. They may become inflamed, causing discomfort, swelling, and limited movement in that area.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1407">Structure and Function of the Skeletal Muscle System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Muscles are attached by tendons to bones, connective tissue, other muscles, soft tissue, or skin. The muscles of the body are composed of parallel groups of muscle cells (fasciculi) encased in fibrous tissue called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fascia:&lt;/b&gt; fibrous tissue that covers, supports, and separates muscles (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; epimysium)">fascia</button></strong> (epimysium). The more fasciculi contained in a muscle, the more precise the movements. Muscles vary in shape and size according to the activities for which they are responsible. Skeletal (striated) muscles are involved in body movement, posture, and heat-production functions. Muscles contract to bring the two points of attachment closer together, resulting in movement (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Skeletal Muscle Contraction <img class="m" src="images/concepts.jpg" alt="icon" /></h6>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be8733b9a86a" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Muscle Contraction</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Each muscle cell (also referred to as a muscle fiber) contains myofibrils, which in turn are composed of a series of sarcomeres&#x2014;the actual contractile units of skeletal muscle. Sarcomeres contain thick myosin and thin actin filaments.</p>
<p class="indent">Muscle cells contract in response to electrical stimulation delivered by an effector nerve cell at the motor end-plate. When stimulated, the muscle cell depolarizes and generates an action potential in a manner similar to that described for nerve cells. These action potentials propagate along the muscle cell membrane and lead to the release of calcium ions that are stored in a specialized organelle called <em>sarcoplasmic reticulum.</em> When there is a local increase in calcium ion concentration, the myosin and actin filaments slide across one another. Shortly after the muscle cell membrane is depolarized, it recovers its resting membrane voltage. Calcium is rapidly removed from the sarcomeres by active reaccumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When the calcium concentration in the sarcomere decreases, the myosin and actin filaments cease to interact, and the sarcomere returns to its original resting length (relaxation). Actin and myosin do not interact in the absence of calcium (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The contraction of muscle fibers can result in either isotonic or isometric contraction of the muscle. In <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;isometric contraction:&lt;/b&gt; muscle tension is increased without changing its length; there is no associated joint motion">isometric contraction</button></strong>, the length of the muscles remains constant but the force generated by the muscles is increased; an example of this is pushing against an immovable wall. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;isotonic contraction:&lt;/b&gt; muscle is shortened without a change in its tension; a joint is moved as a result">Isotonic contraction</button></strong> is characterized by the shortening of the muscle without an increase in tension within the muscle; an example of this is flexing the forearm. In normal activities, many muscle movements are a combination of isometric and isotonic contraction. For example, during walking, isotonic contraction results in shortening of the leg, and isometric contraction causes the stiff leg to push against the floor.</p>
<p class="indent">Energy is consumed during muscle contraction and relaxation. The main source of energy for the muscle cells is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is generated through cellular oxidative metabolism. At low levels of activity (i.e., sedentary activity), the skeletal muscle synthesizes ATP from the oxidation of glucose to water and carbon dioxide. During periods of strenuous activity, when sufficient oxygen may not be available, glucose is metabolized primarily to lactic acid, an inefficient process compared with that of oxidative pathways. Stored muscle glycogen is used to supply glucose during periods of activity. Muscle fatigue is thought to be caused by depletion of glycogen and accumulation of lactic acid. As a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1101" title="1101"></span>result, the cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation cannot continue (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During muscle contraction, the energy released from ATP is not completely used. The excess energy is dissipated in the form of heat. During isometric contraction, almost all of the energy is released in the form of heat; during isotonic contraction, some of the energy is expended in mechanical work. In some situations (i.e., shivering), the need to generate heat is the main stimulus for muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The speed of the muscle contraction is variable. Myoglobulin is a hemoglobinlike protein pigment present in striated muscle cells that transports oxygen. Muscles containing large quantities of myoglobulin (red muscles) have been observed to contract slowly and powerfully (e.g., respiratory and postural muscles). Muscles containing little myoglobulin (white muscles) contract quickly (e.g., extraocular eye muscles). Most muscles contain both red and white muscle fibers (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Muscle Tone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Muscle <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tone:&lt;/b&gt; normal tension (resistance to stretch) in resting muscle (&lt;em&gt;synonym:&lt;/em&gt; tonus)">tone</button></strong> (tonus) is produced by the maintenance of some of the muscle fibers in a contracted state. Muscle spindles, which are sense organs in the muscles, monitor muscle tone. Muscle tone is minimal during sleep and is increased when the person is anxious. A muscle that is limp and without tone is described as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;flaccid:&lt;/b&gt; limp; without muscle tone">flaccid</button></strong>; a muscle with greater-than-normal tone is described as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;spastic:&lt;/b&gt; having greater-than-normal muscle tone">spastic</button></strong>. Typically, upper motor neuron lesions produce increased tone, whereas lower motor neuron lesions produce decreased tone. For example, in conditions characterized by upper motor neuron destruction (e.g., cerebral palsy), muscle becomes hypertonic and reflexes become hyperactive. In contrast, conditions characterized by lower motor neuron destruction (e.g., muscular dystrophy), denervated muscle becomes <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;atonic:&lt;/b&gt; without tone; denervated muscle that atrophies">atonic</button></strong> (soft and flabby) and atrophies (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>). See <a href="c60.xhtml">Chapter 60</a>, <a href="c60-sec01.xhtml#tt60-4">Table 60-4</a>, for a comparison of upper and lower motor function.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Muscle Actions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Muscle contraction produces movement. The body is able to perform a wide variety of movements as a result of the coordination of muscle groups (<a href="c35-sec02.xhtml#ff35-3">Fig. 35-3</a>). The prime mover is the muscle that causes a particular motion. The muscles assisting the prime mover are known as synergists. The muscles causing movement opposite to that of the prime mover are known as antagonists. An antagonist must relax to allow the prime mover to contract, producing motion. For example, when contraction of the biceps causes flexion of the elbow joint, the biceps are the prime movers and the triceps are the antagonists. A person with muscle paralysis (i.e., loss of movement) may be able to retrain functioning muscles within the synergistic group to produce the needed movement. Muscles of the synergistic group then become the prime movers (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Exercise, Disuse, and Repair</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Muscles need exercise to maintain function and strength. When a muscle repeatedly develops maximum or close to maximum tension over a long time, as in regular exercise with weights, the cross-sectional area of the muscle increases. This enlargement, known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypertrophy:&lt;/b&gt; enlargement; increase in the size of a muscle">hypertrophy</button></strong>, results from an increase in the size of individual muscle fibers without an increase in their number. Hypertrophy persists only if the exercise is continued. The opposite phenomenon occurs with disuse of muscle over a long period of time. Age and disuse cause loss of muscular function as fibrotic tissue replaces the contractile muscle tissue. The decrease in the size of a muscle is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;atrophy:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in the size of a muscle">atrophy</button></strong>. Bed rest and immobility cause loss of muscle mass and strength. When immobility is the result of a treatment modality (e.g., casting, traction, or bed rest), the patient can decrease the effects of immobility by isometric exercise of the muscles of the immobilized part. Quadriceps contraction exercises (tightening the muscles of the thigh) and gluteal setting exercises (tightening of the muscles of the buttocks) help maintain the larger muscle groups that are important in ambulation. Active and weight-resistance exercises of uninjured parts of the body maintain muscle strength. When muscles are injured, they need rest and immobilization until tissue repair occurs. The healed muscle then needs progressive exercise to resume its pre-injury strength and functional ability.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1408"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt="icon" /> <strong>Gerontologic Considerations</strong></h5>
<p class="nonindent">Multiple changes in the musculoskeletal system occur with aging (<a href="c35-sec02.xhtml#tt35-1">Table 35-1</a>) and bring complaints of pain and joint limitations. There is a loss of height due to osteoporosis (abnormal excessive bone loss), kyphosis (forward curvature of the thoracic spine), thinned intervertebral discs, compressed vertebral bodies, and flexion of the knees and hips. Numerous metabolic changes, including menopausal withdrawal of estrogen and decreased activity, contribute to osteoporosis (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2524">National Osteoporosis Foundation [NOF], 2019</a>). Women lose more bone mass than men. In addition, bones change in shape and have reduced strength. Fractures are common. Collagen structures are less able to absorb energy. Increased inactivity, diminished neuron stimulation, and nutritional deficiencies contribute to the loss of muscle strength. In addition, remote musculoskeletal problems for which the patient has compensated may become new problems with age-related changes. For example, people who have had polio and who have been able to function normally by using synergistic muscle groups may discover increasing incapacity because of a reduced compensatory ability. Older adults may suffer from chronic musculoskeletal disorders that limit mobility and interfere with their ability to perform self-care. This may lead older adults to depend on others for completion of their activities of daily living (ADLs); in turn, they may grieve over the loss of independence. In particular, musculoskeletal disorders of the hand and wrist are prevalent among older adults; and, the incidence of these disorders increases with increasing age (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2523">Leow, Teo, Low, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>) (see Nursing Research Profile: Hand Assessment of Older Adults in <a href="c35-sec02.xhtml#ct35-1">Chart 35-1</a>). Despite a multitude of age-related musculoskeletal changes, the many effects of aging can be slowed if the body is kept healthy and active through positive lifestyle behaviors (<a href="c35-sec03.xhtml#bib2534">Eliopoulos, 2018</a>).</p>
