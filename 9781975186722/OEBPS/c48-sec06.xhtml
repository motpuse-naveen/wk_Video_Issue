<h4 class="h4a" id="s2138"><strong>RENAL CANCER</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Renal cancer is relatively rare in the United States and accounts for about 4.2% of all cancers. However, an increased incidence of renal cancer at all stages has been noted in the past two decades (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3551">National Cancer Institute, 2019</a>). This increase may be due to improved detection as a result of incidental findings during other diagnostic tests. The incidence of renal cell carcinoma is higher in men and in individuals with an increased body mass index. Tobacco use continues to be a significant risk factor (see <a href="#ct48-3">Chart&#x00A0;48-3</a>). In addition, African Americans have higher rates of renal cancer than Caucasians (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Conde &#x0026; Workman, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ninety percent of renal cancers derive from the renal parenchyma and are known as renal cell carcinomas or renal adenocarcinomas. Between 70% and 80% of all renal cell carcinomas are clear cell carcinoma (also known as conventional or nonpapillary) and arise from the proximal renal tubule. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1563" title="1563"></span>The next most prevalent form (10%) is papillary renal cell carcinomas (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3531">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2020</a>). These tumors may metastasize to the lungs, abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes, brain, bone, and liver; metastatic disease is seen in 30% of patients at diagnosis (ACS, 2020).</p>

<p class="indent">Staging is based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. The 5-year survival rate based on the stage of renal cancer at diagnosis is 92% with only local involvement, 65% with regional spread, and 12% with distant metastases (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Conde &#x0026; Workman, 2017</a>). Although enhanced imaging techniques account for improved detection of early-stage kidney cancer, it is unknown why the rate of late-stage, metastatic renal cancers is high. Over 50% of renal cancers are found incidentally on radiologic studies in individuals who have no symptoms (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Conde &#x0026; Workman, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2139">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many renal tumors produce no symptoms and are discovered on a routine physical examination as a palpable abdominal or flank mass. Signs and symptoms, which occur in only 10% of patients, include hematuria, pain, and a mass in the flank. The usual sign that first calls attention to the tumor is painless hematuria, which may be either intermittent and microscopic, or continuous and overt (gross hematuria) (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Conde &#x0026; Workman, 2017</a>). There may be a dull pain in the back from the pressure produced by compression of the ureter, extension of the tumor into the perirenal area, or hemorrhage into the kidney tissue. Colicky pains occur if a clot or mass of tumor cells passes down the ureter. Symptoms from metastasis may be the first manifestations of a renal tumor and may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and anemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2140">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of a renal tumor may require IV urography, cystoscopic examination, renal angiograms, ultrasonography, or a CT or MRI scan (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>). These tests may be exhausting for patients already debilitated by the systemic effects of a tumor as well as for older patients and those who are anxious about the diagnosis and outcome. The nurse assists the patient to prepare physically and psychologically for these procedures and monitors carefully for signs and symptoms of dehydration and impaired coping.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2141">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of medical management is to detect the tumor early and to eradicate tumors before metastasis occurs. Treatment most often includes a combination of surgery and pharmacologic management. Radiation therapy may be used for palliation in patients who are not candidates for surgery or other treatments or in those with metastatic disease (ACS, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Surgical Management</h6>
<p class="h7">Nephrectomy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Open, laparoscopic, or robotic surgical procedures are utilized for radical and partial nephrectomies (ACS, 2020). A radical nephrectomy is the primary treatment if the tumor can be removed and if the tumor has spread to the inferior vena cava (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Conde &#x0026; Workman, 2017</a>). This includes removal of the kidney (and tumor), adrenal gland, surrounding perinephric fat and Gerota fascia, and lymph nodes. Laparoscopic nephrectomy can be performed for removal of the kidney with a small tumor. This procedure incurs less morbidity and a shorter recovery time. Radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy may be used along with surgery. Nephron-sparing surgery, or partial nephrectomy, is increasingly being used to treat patients with bilateral tumors, cancer of a functional single kidney, and for small local tumors with a normal contralateral kidney. This is the preferred surgery for local disease as well as for those individuals with risk factors for CKD. The success rate of partial nephrectomies is excellent with operative morbidity and mortality both low (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Richie, Atkins, &#x0026; Chen, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Renal Artery Embolization</p>
<p class="nonindent">In patients with metastatic renal carcinoma, the renal artery may be occluded to impede the blood supply to the tumor and thus kill the tumor cells. After angiographic studies are completed, a catheter is advanced into the renal artery, and embolizing materials (e.g., Gelfoam, autologous blood clot, steel coils) are injected into the artery and carried with the arterial blood flow to occlude the tumor vessels mechanically. This decreases the local blood supply, making nephrectomy easier. After renal artery embolization and tumor infarction, a characteristic symptom complex called postinfarction syndrome occurs, lasting 2 to 3 days. The patient has pain localized to the flank and abdomen, elevated temperature, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Pain is treated with parenteral analgesic agents, and acetaminophen is given to control fever. Antiemetic medications, restriction of oral intake, and IV fluids are used to treat the GI symptoms.</p>
<p class="h7">Minimally Invasive Technologies</p>
<p class="nonindent">Radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or microwave ablation are minimally invasive technologies performed by urologists or interventional radiologists. They are used instead of surgery in select patients for many types of tumors, including renal cell carcinomas. In renal cell carcinomas these nephron-sparing procedures can be used for either small, localized renal tumors, if patients are poor surgical candidates and/or to preserve renal function. In these procedures, temperature extremes are used to kill tumor cells (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hines &#x0026; Goldberg, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Depending on the stage of the tumor, partial or radical nephrectomy may be followed by treatment with immunotherapy. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1564" title="1564"></span>Standard chemotherapy has not improved survival rates and is only used for those patients in whom immunotherapy has not been successful (ACS, 2020). For stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinomas, treatment with biologic response modifiers such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon has largely been replaced by targeted therapies, antiangiogenic therapy, and checkpoint inhibitors (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">George &#x0026; Jonasch, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Experimental approaches to stimulate the host immune recognition of tumor through autologous tumor cell immunotherapy are being actively pursued in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinomas (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">George &#x0026; Jonasch, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2142">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with a renal tumor usually undergoes extensive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. After surgery, the patient usually has catheters and drains in place to maintain a patent urinary tract, to remove drainage, and to permit accurate measurement of urine output. Because of the location of the surgical incision, the patient&#x2019;s position during surgery, and the nature of the surgical procedure, pain and muscle soreness are common. Pharmacologic management may include immunotherapy agents. Therefore, patients are monitored for infection.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient requires frequent analgesia during the postoperative period and assistance with turning, coughing, the use of incentive spirometry, and deep breathing to prevent atelectasis and other pulmonary complications (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). The patient and family require assistance and support to cope with the diagnosis and uncertain prognosis. See discussion later in this chapter of postoperative care of the patient undergoing kidney surgery and <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for discussion of care of the patient with cancer.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse educates the patient and family about how to inspect and care for the incision and to perform other general postoperative care including activity, lifting and driving restrictions, and pain management. Instructions are provided about when to notify the primary provider about problems (e.g., fever, respiratory difficulty, wound drainage, blood in the urine, pain or swelling of the legs).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse encourages the patient to eat a healthy diet and to drink adequate liquids to avoid constipation and to maintain an adequate urine volume. Stool softeners, mild stimulants (e.g., senna), and polyethylene glycol may also be prescribed to avoid constipation. Education and emotional support are provided related to the diagnosis, treatment, and continuing care because many patients are concerned about the loss of the other kidney, the possible need for dialysis, or the recurrence of cancer.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Follow-up care is essential to detect any signs of metastases and to reassure the patient and family about the patient&#x2019;s status and well-being. The patient who has had surgery for renal carcinoma should have a yearly physical examination and chest x-ray, because late metastases are not uncommon (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">George &#x0026; Jonasch, 2019</a>). All subsequent symptoms should be evaluated with possible metastases in mind.</p>
<p class="indent">If follow-up immunotherapy is necessary, the patient and family are informed about the treatment plan or immunotherapy protocol, what to expect with each visit, and when to notify the primary provider. Evaluation of remaining renal function (creatinine clearance, BUN, and serum creatinine levels) may also be carried out periodically. A home health nurse may monitor the patient&#x2019;s physical status and psychological well-being and coordinate other indicated services and resources.</p>
