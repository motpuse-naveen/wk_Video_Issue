<h4 class="h4" id="s426">Palliative Care and End-of-Life Care</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;palliative care:&lt;/b&gt; a patient/person and family-centered approach to care that attends to the physical, functional, psychological, spiritual, and existential aspects of a serious illness">Palliative care</button></strong> uses an interdisciplinary model of care, focusing on symptom management and psychosocial/spiritual support for those with serious, life-limiting illnesses. Palliative care aims to improve quality of life for people and families through early integration into the plan of care strategies for managing pain and symptoms and for reducing burdensome care transitions through interdisciplinary teamwork, care coordination, clinician&#x2013;patient communication, and decisional support. It is appropriate for patients at any age and at any stage in a serious illness, even while pursuing disease-directed or curative therapies, and extending into bereavement for families (<a href="c13.xhtml#ff13-1">Fig.&#x00A0;13-1</a>). Palliative care can be viewed as both an approach to care and as a structured system for care delivery that aims to optimize quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1089">National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care [NCP], 2018</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;interdisciplinary collaboration:&lt;/b&gt; communication and cooperation among members of diverse health care disciplines jointly to plan, implement, and evaluate care">Interdisciplinary collaboration</button></strong> is an essential component which is rooted in communication and cooperation among the various disciplines, with each member of the team contributing to a single integrated care plan that addresses the needs of the patient and the family. In contrast, multidisciplinary care refers to participation of clinicians with varied backgrounds and skill sets but without coordination and integration of care into a unified plan.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hospice:&lt;/b&gt; a coordinated program of interdisciplinary care and services for terminally ill patients and their families">Hospice</button></strong> is a type of palliative care, focusing on comfort at the end-of-life. When patients enroll in hospice, they have made the decision to forego disease-directed therapies and focus solely on the relief of symptoms associated with their illness and the dying process. Both palliative care and hospice clinicians are skilled in the delivery of end-of-life care (which may include the months or weeks prior to death), expert pain and symptom management, life review and bereavement support. Focus on care of the dying is motivated by the aging of the population, the prevalence of and publicity surrounding life-threatening illnesses, and the increasing likelihood of a prolonged period of chronic illness prior to death. <a href="#ff13-2">Figure&#x00A0;13-2</a> depicts four illness trajectories: sudden death, terminal illness, organ failure, and frailty. Sudden death is unexpected and accounts for the minority of deaths in this day and age. The other trajectories depict a common course in three types of chronic life-limiting illness: (1) terminal illness (e.g., cancer) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page369" title="369"></span>is generally diagnosed when one is highly functioning, with a short steady decline before death; (2) organ failure (e.g., heart failure, end-stage kidney disease, or chronic lung disease) usually follows a slow decline after diagnosis, with episodic illnesses, perhaps exacerbation or hospitalization, where one has difficulty returning back to functional baseline; and (3) frailty (e.g., dementia) is typically diagnosed when one is already frail, with a slow decline over years. With the exception of sudden death, functional status can be a good prognostic indication; one such scale, the Palliative Performance Scale, is based on ambulation, activity, outward evidence of disease, self-care, intake, and level of consciousness (10-point increments, with 100% being fully functional and independent) (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1137">Hui, Park, Liu, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s427">The Evolution of End-of-Life Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the 20th century, chronic, degenerative diseases replaced communicable diseases as the major causes of death. In the earlier part of the 20th century, most deaths occurred at home and most families had direct experience with death, through providing care to family members at the end-of-life and then mourning their losses together as a family unit. As the place of death shifted from home to hospitals, families became increasingly distanced from the death experience, placing the care of the patient into the health care provider&#x2019;s hands.</p>
<p class="indent">In the latter half of the 20th century, a technologic imperative practice pattern among health care professionals emerged, along with an expectation among patients and families that every available means to extend life must be tried. In the 21st century, technologic intervention at the end-of-life continues to have profound implications, affecting how clinicians care for the dying, how family and friends participate in care, how patients and families understand and choose among end-of-life care options, how families prepare for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;terminal illness:&lt;/b&gt; progressive, irreversible illness that despite cure-focused medical treatment will result in the patient&#x2019;s death">terminal illness</button></strong> (a progressive, irreversible illness that despite medical treatment will result in the patient&#x2019;s death) and death, and how they heal after the death of a loved one. Palliative and end-of-life care continues to evolve with the technology and medical interventions that are used to care for the seriously ill.</p>
<p class="indent">Between 2000 and 2050, the number of people older than 85 years is expected to quadruple (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1184">West, Cole, Goodkind, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). More than half of the aged population has one or more chronic, serious illness (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1184">West et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). The incidence of life-limiting illness is expected to continue to rise. Numerous initiatives aimed at improving end-of-life care have been launched in recent years, spurred by a widespread call for substantive change in the way Americans deal with death. In 2014, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a consensus report titled <em>Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near the End of Life.</em> The report presented a summary of findings from a review of the evidence and provided recommendations for improving palliative and end-of-life care. The authors noted that patients experienced many transitions in settings, frequent and potentially avoidable hospital readmission, and inconsistent referral to palliative care. Recommendations include widespread and timely access to, and comprehensive coverage for palliative care services, improved clinician&#x2013;patient communication, greater emphasis on advance care planning, professional education and development, and stronger public education and engagement (IOM, 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">The NCP identified eight key domains that underline a more comprehensive and humane approach to the care of the seriously ill patient at any stage, age, setting or prognosis, with the most recent update released in 2018 and outlined in <a href="c13-sec02.xhtml#ct13-1">Chart&#x00A0;13-1</a> (NCP, 2018). These practice guidelines have been endorsed by more than 80 national organizations, such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), American Cancer Society (ACS), Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association (HPNA), and the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), to structure and evaluate quality palliative and end-of-life programs for all those with serious illness at any stage, age, setting or prognosis.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2017, the ANA in collaboration with HPNA developed a <em>Call for Action&#x2014;Nurses Lead and Transform Palliative Care,</em> which outlined the five areas of palliative nursing care: clinical practice, education, policy, research, and administration. In the document, the ANA and HPNA outline ways that nurses can transform palliative care, both as primary and specialty palliative care clinicians (ANA, 2017a). Primary palliative care is defined as the fundamental palliative care skills that all health care providers should have, including basic symptom assessment and management and the ability to explore goals of care through therapeutic communication. In contrast, the palliative care specialist addresses complex symptoms and navigates difficult goals of care conversations and family conflict. As a measure to better incorporate primary palliative care into nursing education, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) recommended a new curriculum for palliative education for undergraduate nurses, including developing an online version of the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) (<a href="c13-sec05.xhtml#bib1126">Ferrell, Malloy, Mazanec, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).
