<h4 class="h4" id="s486">The Surgical Team</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The surgical team consists of the patient, the anesthesiologist (physician) or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), the surgeon, nurses, surgical technicians, and registered nurse first assistants (RNFAs) or certified surgical technologists (assistants). The anesthesiologist or CRNA administers the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;anesthetic agent:&lt;/b&gt; the substance, such as a chemical or gas, used to induce anesthesia">anesthetic agent</button></strong> (substance used to induce anesthesia) and monitors the patient&#x2019;s physical status throughout the surgery. The surgeon, nurses, technicians, and assistants scrub and perform the surgery. The person in the scrub role, either a nurse or a surgical technician, provides sterile instruments and supplies to the surgeon during the procedure by anticipating the surgical needs as the surgical case progresses. The circulating nurse coordinates the care of the patient in the OR. Care provided by the circulating nurse includes planning for and assisting with patient positioning, preparing the site for surgery, managing surgical specimens, anticipating the needs of the surgical team, documenting intraoperative events, and updating the plan of care. Collaboration of the core surgical team using evidence-based practices tailored to the specific case results in optimum patient care and improved outcomes (see <a href="#ct15-1">Chart&#x00A0;15-1</a>).</p>

<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong>Can Lack of Civility in the OR Threaten Patient Safety?</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You are a registered nurse who has worked in the operating room (OR) for the past five years. You have enjoyed an ancillary role precepting students for the past two years. Recently, you volunteered to serve as a preceptor for a nurse who is transferring to the OR after working as a registered nurse on a general medical-surgical unit for the past two years since graduating from nursing school. The new nurse was accepted into the hospital&#x2019;s onsite perioperative nursing internship program three months ago and has completed most of the classroom portion of the program, reportedly receiving excellent test scores. Today, she is assigned to the role of scrub nurse. A staff nurse with 20 years of experience in the OR is the circulating nurse assigned to the OR suite where the new nurse is assigned. As you are preparing to enter the OR suite to check on the new nurse and to verify that she has setup the instruments properly, the circulating nurse storms angrily out of the room, rolls her eyes and tells you &#x201C;that newbie badly bungled&#x201D; and did not set up instruments correctly for the case. You immediately walk into the OR suite to investigate and find the surgeon and the CRNA are there, as well as the new nurse, who is blinking back tears. The new nurse tells you that the circulating nurse &#x201C;chewed me out in front of everyone.&#x201D; The surgeon requests to have a different nurse assigned to be the scrub nurse.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In the <em>Code of Ethics for Nurses</em>, the American Nurses Association (ANA; 2015) stresses that it is the responsibility of the nurse to treat colleagues with civility, dignity, and respect and that doing so creates an ethical work environment. By contrast, incivility, which can be evidenced by harassment, intimidation, and bullying, is considered morally unacceptable behaviors for the nurse to exhibit. Clark and Kenski (2017) take these tenets further, and note that incivility, which can consist of both overt behaviors (e.g., yelling, making disparaging remarks) as well as covert behaviors (e.g., eye rolling, withholding communication) can disrupt important professional transactions and communication, which may then threaten patient safety. They assert that &#x201C;nurses have an ethical responsibility to foster healthy work environments in which conflict is managed in a respectful way and communication is clear, direct, and concise.&#x201D; (p. 62).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart&#x00A0;1-7</a>). Who are the stakeholders who might have been adversely affected by this event? Do nurses have a moral obligation to foster beneficent relationships? Can incivility threaten nonmaleficence?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe how you would proceed and what you would say to the nurse you are precepting. Would your communication with her be different if you were to find that she had set up the instruments correctly or incorrectly? Would you honor the surgeon&#x2019;s request and ask the charge nurse to change the new nurse&#x2019;s assignment?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources might be of help to you so that a civil work environment may be cultivated? Should the nurse manager or other administrators be consulted to help resolve this conflict?</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s487">The Patient</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As the patient enters the OR, they may feel either relaxed and prepared or fearful and highly stressed. These feelings depend to a large extent on the amount and timing of preoperative sedation, preoperative education, and the individual patient. Fears about loss of control, the unknown, pain, death, changes in body structure, appearance, or function, and disruption of lifestyle all contribute to anxiety. These fears can increase the amount of anesthetic medication needed, the level of postoperative pain, and overall recovery time (see <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> for more information on stress).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is subject to several risks. Infection, failure of the surgery to relieve symptoms or correct a deformity, temporary or permanent complications related to the procedure or the anesthetic agent, and death are uncommon but potential outcomes of the surgical experience (see <a href="#ct15-2">Chart&#x00A0;15-2</a>). In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page418" title="418"></span>addition to fears and risks, the patient undergoing sedation and anesthesia temporarily loses both cognitive function and biologic self-protective mechanisms. Loss of the sense of pain, reflexes, and the ability to communicate subjects the intraoperative patient to possible injury. The OR nurse is the patient&#x2019;s advocate while surgery proceeds.</p>

<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One in 10 patients undergoing surgery is age 65 or older (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1261">American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA], 2019</a>). Older adult patients are at higher risk for complications from anesthesia and surgery compared with younger adult patients due to several factors (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). One factor is age-related decline in physiologic reserve that weakens the normal response to stressors, acute illness, anesthesia, and surgery (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1290">Vernon, Rice, Titch, et al., 2019</a>). Risks include delirium, hypothermia, positioning injury, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) formation, electrolyte imbalance, and circulatory compromise. Further discussion of age-related physiologic changes can be found in <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Biologic variations of particular importance include age-related cardiovascular and pulmonary changes. The aging heart and blood vessels have decreased ability to respond to stress. Cardiac output and pulmonary capacity diminish with age, with a decline in maximal oxygen uptake. Slow circulation and hypotension predispose the patient to thrombus formation and emboli (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Phillips, 2017</a>). Excessive or rapid administration of intravenous (IV) solutions can cause pulmonary edema. A sudden or prolonged decline in blood pressure may lead to cerebral ischemia, thrombosis, embolism, infarction, and anoxia. Reduced gas exchange can result in cerebral hypoxia.</p>
<p class="indent">Lower doses of anesthetic agents are required in older adults due to decreased tissue elasticity (lung and cardiovascular systems) and reduced lean tissue mass. Older patients often experience an increase in the duration of clinical effects of medications. With decreased plasma proteins, more of the anesthetic agent remains free or unbound, and the result is more potent action (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1263">Barash, Cullen, Stoelting, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, body tissues of the older adult are made up predominantly of water, and those tissues with a rich blood supply, such as skeletal muscle, liver, and kidneys, shrink as the body ages. Reduced liver size decreases the rate at which the liver can inactivate many anesthetic agents, and decreased kidney function slows the elimination of waste products and anesthetic agents. Nursing management for the older surgical patient in the intraoperative period includes the following (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Phillips, 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Application of intraoperative warming techniques to reduce unintentional hypothermia</span></li>
<li><span>Careful transfer and positioning on the OR bed. Protect pressure points and bony prominences with extra padding. Support the back and neck to prevent stiffness while maintaining respiratory and circulatory support</span></li>
<li><span>Use of antiembolic stockings or a sequential compression device to prevent VTE formation</span></li>
<li><span>Careful fluid and electrolyte monitoring via accurate blood loss measurement, urinary output, and blood gases</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Nursing Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Throughout surgery, nursing responsibilities include providing for the safety and well-being of the patient, coordinating the OR personnel, and performing scrub and circulating activities. Because the patient&#x2019;s emotional state remains a concern, the intraoperative nursing staff provides the patient with information and reassurance, continuing the care initiated by preoperative nurses. The nurse supports coping strategies and reinforces the patient&#x2019;s ability to influence outcomes by encouraging active participation in the plan of care, incorporating cultural, ethnic, and religious considerations as appropriate. The establishment of an environment of trust and relaxation through visualization techniques is another method of patient reassurance that can be used as the patient is anesthetically induced.</p>
<p class="indent">As patient advocates, intraoperative nurses monitor factors that have the potential to cause injury, such as patient position, equipment malfunction, and environmental hazards. Nurses also protect the patient&#x2019;s dignity and interests while the patient is under anesthesia. Additional nursing responsibilities include maintaining surgical standards of care, identifying risks, and minimizing complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cultural Diversity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cultural, ethnic, and religious diversities are important considerations for all health care professionals. Nurses in the perioperative area should be aware of medications that may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page419" title="419"></span>be prohibited by certain groups (e.g., Muslims and those of the Jewish faith may not wish to use porcine-based products [heparin (porcine or bovine)]; Buddhists may choose not to use bovine products). In certain cultures, the head is a sacred area, and staff should allow patients to apply their own surgical cap in this case. When English is the second language of the patient having surgery under local anesthesia, certified medical translators can be provided to maintain understanding and comprehension by the patient. Translator devices are also available at most hospitals. Family members may have the ability to translate but should not be used as medical translators, as they may wish to save the patient anxiety and not provide an accurate translation, resulting in the patient not receiving complete information.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s488">The Circulating Nurse</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>circulating nurse (or circulator)</strong>, a qualified registered nurse, works in collaboration with surgeons, anesthesia providers, and other health care providers to plan the best course of action for each patient (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). In this leadership role, the circulating nurse manages the OR and protects the patient&#x2019;s safety and health by monitoring the activities of the surgical team, checking the OR conditions, and continually assessing the patient for signs of injury and implementing appropriate interventions. A foremost responsibility includes verifying consent; if not obtained, surgery may not commence. The team is coordinated by the circulating nurse, who ensures cleanliness, proper temperature, humidity, appropriate lighting, safe function of equipment, and the availability of supplies and materials.</p>
<p class="indent">The circulating nurse monitors aseptic practices to avoid breaks in technique while coordinating the movement of related personnel (medical, x-ray, and laboratory), as well as implementing fire safety precautions. The circulating nurse also monitors the patient and documents specific activities throughout the operation to ensure the patient&#x2019;s safety and well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the circulating nurse is responsible for ensuring that the second verification of the surgical procedure and site takes place and is documented (see <a href="#ff15-1">Fig.&#x00A0;15-1</a>). In some institutions, this is referred to as a time-out, surgical pause, or universal protocol that takes place among the surgical team prior to induction of anesthesia with a briefing about anticipated problems, potential complications, allergies, and comorbidities. Every member of the surgical team verifies the patient&#x2019;s name, procedure, and surgical site using objective documentation and data before beginning the surgery. Identifying patients correctly is a 2019 National Patient Safety Goal (see <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <a href="c14-sec10.xhtml#ct14-7">Chart&#x00A0;14-7</a>). The Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) (see <a href="#ff15-1">Fig.&#x00A0;15-1</a>) has been adopted in ORs worldwide to reduce medical errors, increase patient safety, and improve interprofessional communication (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1295">Ziman, Espin, Grant, et al., 2018</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page420" title="420"></span>A team debriefing session, led by the circulating nurse, often follows the completion of surgery to identify potential problems with the postsurgical care of the patient and potential areas for improvement (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1261">American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses [ASPAN], 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>It is imperative that the correct patient identity, surgical procedure, and surgical site be verified prior to surgery. The surgical site should be marked by the physician and confirmed by the patient prior to coming to the OR suite during the consent process.

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s489">The Scrub Role</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or surgical technologist (or assistant) performs the activities of the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;scrub role:&lt;/b&gt; registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or surgical technologist who scrubs and dons sterile surgical attire, prepares instruments and supplies, and hands instruments to the surgeon during the procedure">scrub role</button></strong>, including performing hand hygiene; setting up the sterile equipment, tables, and sterile field; preparing sutures, ligatures, and special equipment (e.g., a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;laparoscope:&lt;/b&gt; a thin endoscope inserted through a small incision into a cavity or joint using fiber-optic technology to project live images of structures onto a video monitor; other small incisions allow additional instruments to be inserted to facilitate laparoscopic surgery">laparoscope</button></strong>, which is a thin endoscope inserted through a small incision into a cavity or joint using fiber-optic technology to project live images of structures onto a video monitor); and assisting the surgeon and the surgical assistants during the procedure by anticipating the instruments and supplies that will be required, such as sponges, drains, and other equipment. As the surgical incision is closed, the scrub person and the circulating nurse count all needles, sponges, and instruments to be sure that they are accounted for and not retained as a foreign body in the patient (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1262">Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses [AORN], 2019a; Rothrock, 2019</a>). Standards call for all sponges used in surgery to be visible on x-ray and for sponge counts to take place at the beginning of surgery and twice at the end (when wound closure begins and again as the skin is being closed). Tissue specimens obtained during surgery are labeled by the person in the scrub role and sent to the laboratory by the circulating nurse. Medications and solutions are transferred to the sterile table by the circulating nurse and the name, strength, dosage, and expiration date are labeled by the person in the scrub role. Implants are handled in a similar fashion whereby the name, type, size, expiration date, and sterility are verified prior to handoff to the person in the scrub role.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s490">The Surgeon</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The surgeon performs the surgical procedure, heads the surgical team, and is a licensed physician (MD or DO), oral surgeon (DDS or DMD), or podiatrist (DPM) who is specially trained and qualified. Qualifications and training must adhere to The Joint Commission standards, hospital standards, and local and state admitting practices and procedures (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s491">The Registered Nurse First Assistant</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>registered nurse first assistant (RNFA)</strong> is another member of the OR team. Although the scope of practice of the RNFA depends on each state&#x2019;s nurse practice act, the RNFA practices under the direct supervision of the surgeon. RNFA responsibilities may include handling tissue, providing exposure at the operative field, suturing, and maintaining hemostasis (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>). The role requires a thorough understanding of anatomy and physiology, tissue handling, and the principles of surgical asepsis. The RNFA must be aware of the objectives of the surgery, must have the knowledge and ability to anticipate needs and to work as a skilled member of a team, and must be able to handle any emergency situation in the OR.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s492">The Anesthesiologist and CRNA</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An <strong>anesthesiologis</strong>t is a physician specifically trained in the art and science of anesthesiology. A <strong>certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA)</strong> is a qualified and specifically trained health care professional who administers anesthetic agents, has graduated from an accredited nurse anesthesia program, and has passed examinations sponsored by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. The anesthesiologist or CRNA assesses the patient before surgery, selects the anesthesia, administers it, intubates the patient if necessary, manages any technical problems related to the administration of the anesthetic agent, and supervises the patient&#x2019;s condition throughout the surgical procedure. Before the patient enters the OR, often at preadmission testing, the anesthesiologist or CRNA visits the patient to perform an assessment, supply information, and answer questions. The type of anesthetic agent to be given, previous reactions to anesthetic medications, and known anatomic abnormalities that would make airway management difficult are among topics addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">The anesthesiologist or CRNA uses the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Classification System to determine the patient&#x2019;s status. A patient who is classified as P2, P3, or P4 has a systemic disease that may or may not be related to the cause of surgery. If a patient with a classification of P1, P2, P3, P4, or P5 requires emergency surgery, an E is added to the physical status designation (e.g., P1E, P2E). P6 refers to a patient who is brain dead and is undergoing surgery as an organ donor. The abbreviations ASA1 through ASA6 are often used interchangeably with P1 to P6 to designate physical status (<a href="c15-sec05.xhtml#bib1303">Rothrock, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When the patient arrives in the OR, the anesthesiologist or CRNA reassesses the patient&#x2019;s physical condition immediately prior to initiating anesthesia. The anesthetic agent is given, and the patient&#x2019;s airway is maintained through an intranasal intubation (if the surgeon is using an oral approach to surgery), intubation with an endotracheal tube (ET), or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). During surgery, the anesthesiologist or CRNA monitors the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure, pulse, and respirations, as well as the electrocardiogram (ECG), blood oxygen saturation level, tidal volume, blood gas levels, blood pH, alveolar gas concentrations, and body temperature. End tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring by electroencephalography (EEG) is sometimes required. Levels of anesthetic medications in the body can also be determined; a mass spectrometer can provide instant readouts of critical concentration levels on display terminals. This information is used to assess the patient&#x2019;s ability to breathe unassisted or the need for mechanical assistance if ventilation is poor and the patient is not breathing well independently.</p>
