<h4 class="h4a" id="s1919">ASSESSMENT OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM</h4>
<h4 class="h4" id="s1920"><strong>Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">The endocrine system involves the release of chemical transmitter substances known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hormones:&lt;/b&gt; chemical transmitter substances produced in one organ or part of the body and carried by the bloodstream to other cells or organs on which they have a specific regulatory effect">hormones</button></strong>. These substances regulate and integrate body functions by acting on local or distant target sites. Hormones are generally produced by the endocrine glands but may also be produced by specialized tissues such as those found in the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the kidney, and white blood cells. The GI mucosa produces hormones (e.g., gastrin, enterogastrone, secretin, cholecystokinin) that are important in the digestive process; the kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells; and the white blood cells produce cytokines (hormonelike proteins) that actively participate in inflammatory and immune responses.</p>
<p class="indent">The endocrine system has a unique relationship with the immune and the nervous systems. Chemicals such as neurotransmitters (e.g., epinephrine) released by the nervous system can also function as hormones when needed. The immune system responds to the introduction of foreign agents by means of chemical messengers (cytokines), and is also subject to regulation by adrenal corticosteroid hormones (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1921">Glands of the Endocrine System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The endocrine system is composed of the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, pancreatic islets, ovaries, and testes. See <a href="#ff45-1">Figure 45-1</a> for major hormonal secreting glands of the endocrine system. Most hormones secreted from endocrine glands are released directly into the bloodstream. However, exocrine glands, such as sweat glands, secrete their products through ducts onto epithelial surfaces or into the GI tract.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1922">Function and Regulation of Hormones</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hormones help regulate organ function in concert with the nervous system. The rapid action by the nervous system is balanced by slower hormonal action. This dual regulatory system permits precise control of organ functions in response to changes within and outside the body.</p>
<p class="indent">The endocrine glands are composed of secretory cells arranged in minute clusters known as acini. A rich blood supply provides a vehicle for the hormones produced by the endocrine glands to enter the bloodstream rapidly. The amount of circulating hormones depends on their unique function and the body&#x2019;s needs. In the healthy physiologic state, hormone concentration in the bloodstream is maintained at a relatively constant level. To prevent accumulation, these hormones must be inactivated continuously by a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;negative feedback:&lt;/b&gt; mechanisms that monitor the internal environment and restore homeostasis when conditions shift out of the normal range">negative feedback</button></strong> system so that when the hormone concentration increases, further production of that hormone is inhibited. Conversely, when the hormone concentration decreases, the rate of production of that hormone increases.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1923">Classification and Action of Hormones</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hormones are classified into four categories according to their structure: (1) amines and amino acids (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones); (2) peptides, polypeptides, proteins, and glycoproteins (e.g., thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], and growth hormone [GH]); (3) steroids (e.g., <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;corticosteroids:&lt;/b&gt; the group of steroid hormones, such as cortisol, that are produced by the adrenal cortex; they are involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and have anti-inflammatory properties">corticosteroids</button></strong>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1447" title="1447"></span>which are hormones produced by the adrenal cortex or their synthetic equivalents); and (4) fatty acid derivatives (e.g., eicosanoid, retinoids) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>). Although most hormones released by endocrine glands can be transported to distant target sites for action, some hormones never enter the bloodstream because they act locally in the area where they are released; this is called <em>paracrine action</em> (e.g., the effect of sex hormones on the ovaries). Others may act on the actual cells from which they were released; this is called <em>autocrine action</em> (e.g., the effect of insulin from pancreatic beta cells on those cells) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Hormones can alter the function of the target tissue by interacting with chemical receptors located either on the cell membrane or in the interior of the cell. For example, <em>peptide</em> and <em>protein hormones</em> interact with receptor sites on the cell surface, resulting in stimulation of the intracellular enzyme adenyl cyclase. This causes increased production of cyclic 3&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The cyclic AMP inside the cell alters enzyme activity. Thus, cyclic AMP is the &#x201C;second messenger&#x201D; that links the peptide hormone at the cell surface to a change in the intracellular environment. Some protein and peptide hormones also act by changing membrane permeability and act within seconds or minutes. The mechanism of action for <em>amine hormones</em> is similar to that for peptide hormones (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Steroid hormones,</em> because of their smaller size and higher lipid solubility, penetrate cell membranes and interact with intracellular receptors. The steroid&#x2013;receptor complex modifies cell metabolism and the formation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The mRNA then stimulates protein synthesis within the cell. Steroid hormones require several hours to exert their effects, because they exert their action by the modification of protein synthesis.</p>
