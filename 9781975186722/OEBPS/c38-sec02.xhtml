<h5 class="h5" id="s1576">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A focused GI assessment begins with a complete history. Information about abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gas, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fecal incontinence, jaundice, and previous GI disease is obtained (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Common GI symptoms that may lead patients to seek health care referrals include pain, dyspepsia, gas, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.</p>
<p class="h7">Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pain can be a major symptom of GI disease; in particular, abdominal pain is a frequent presenting problem in general practice (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Babakhanlou, 2018</a>). The character, duration, pattern, frequency, location, distribution of referred abdominal pain (<a href="#ff38-3">Fig. 38-3</a>), and time of the pain can vary greatly depending on the underlying cause. Other factors such as meals, rest, activity, and defecation patterns may directly affect this pain (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Dyspepsia</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dyspepsia:&lt;/b&gt; indigestion; upper abdominal discomfort associated with eating">Dyspepsia</button></strong>&#x2014;upper abdominal discomfort associated with eating (commonly called <em>indigestion</em>)&#x2014;is the most common symptom of patients with GI dysfunction. Indigestion is an imprecise term that refers to a host of upper abdominal or epigastric symptoms such as pain, discomfort, fullness, bloating, early satiety, belching, heartburn, or regurgitation. Annually, dyspepsia affects approximately 25% of Americans (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Longstreth &#x0026; Lacy, 2019</a>) while gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which increases with age and manifests with dyspepsia (most frequently with heartburn), affects approximately 20% of adults in western cultures (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Antunes &#x0026; Curtis, 2019</a>). Typically, fatty foods cause the most discomfort because they remain in the stomach for digestion longer than proteins or carbohydrates. Salads, coarse vegetables, and highly seasoned foods may also cause considerable GI distress. In some cases, health care providers make a distinction between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and GERD; GERD is the more serious and longer-lasting condition (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2840">Mayo Clinic, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Intestinal Gas</p>
<p class="nonindent">The accumulation of gas in the GI tract may result in belching (expulsion of gas from the stomach through the mouth) or flatulence (expulsion of gas from the rectum). Usually, gases in the small intestine pass into the colon and are released as flatus. Patients often complain of bloating, distention, or feeling &#x201C;full of gas&#x201D; with excessive flatulence as a symptom of food intolerance or gallbladder disease.</p>

<p class="h7">Nausea and Vomiting</p>
<p class="nonindent">Nausea is a vague, uncomfortable sensation of sickness or &#x201C;queasiness&#x201D; that may or may not be followed by vomiting. Distention of the duodenum or upper intestinal tract is a common cause of nausea; it may also be an early warning sign of a pathologic process. Nausea can be triggered by odors, activity, medications, or food intake. Vomiting is the forceful emptying of the stomach and intestinal contents through the mouth (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). The emesis, or vomitus, may vary in color and content and may contain undigested food particles, blood (hematemesis), or bilious material mixed with gastric juices. An acute onset of emesis that appears bright red or as coffee grounds is characteristic of a Mallory-Weiss tear (i.e., a laceration in the mucosal lining of the gastroesophageal junction) and indicates upper GI bleeding (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Rich, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The causes of nausea and vomiting are many and may include visceral pain; motion or motion sickness; anxiety; several types of intestinal, vagal or sympathetic input including side effects of medications; and torsion or trauma of the ovaries, testes, uterus, bladder or kidney (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>). Pathways for initiation of the vomiting reflex include medication therapy, metabolic abnormalities (chemoreceptor trigger zone), ingested toxins, chemotherapy, radiation therapy (vagal and splanchnic receptors), inner ear disorders, motion sickness (vestibular center), and anticipatory emesis (cerebral cortex) (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Hainsworth, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Change in Bowel Habits and Stool Characteristics</p>
<p class="nonindent">Changes in bowel habits may signal colonic dysfunction or disease. Diarrhea, an abnormal increase in the frequency and liquidity of the stool or in daily stool weight or volume, commonly occurs when the contents move so rapidly through the intestine and colon that there is inadequate time for the GI secretions and oral contents to be absorbed. This physiologic function is typically associated with abdominal pain or cramping and nausea or vomiting. Constipation&#x2014;a decrease in the frequency of stool, or stools that are hard, dry, and of smaller volume than typical&#x2014;may be associated with anal discomfort and rectal bleeding, and is a frequent reason patients seek health care referrals (see the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct38-1">Chart 38-1</a>) (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2848">Shen, Zhu, Jiang, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). See <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> for further discussion of diarrhea and constipation.</p>
<p class="indent">The characteristics of the stool can vary greatly. Stool is normally light to dark brown; however, specific disease processes and ingestion of certain foods and medications may change the appearance of stool (<a href="#tt38-4">Table 38-4</a>). Blood in the stool can present in various ways and must be investigated. If blood is shed in sufficient quantities into the upper GI tract, it produces a tarry-black color (melena), whereas blood entering the lower portion of the GI tract or passing rapidly through it will appear bright or dark red. Lower rectal or anal bleeding is suspected if there is streaking of blood on the surface of the stool or if blood is noted on toilet tissue. Other common abnormalities in stool characteristics described by the patient may include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Bulky, greasy, foamy stools that are foul in odor and may or may not float</span></li>
<li><span>Light gray or clay-colored stool, caused by a decrease or absence of conjugated bilirubin</span></li>
<li><span>Stool with mucus threads or pus that may be visible on gross inspection of the stool</span></li>
<li><span>Small, dry, rock-hard masses occasionally streaked with blood</span></li>
<li><span>Loose, watery stool that may or may not be streaked with blood</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health, Family, and Social History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse asks about the patient&#x2019;s normal toothbrushing and flossing routine; frequency of dental visits; awareness of any lesions or irritated areas in the mouth, tongue, or throat; recent history of sore throat or bloody sputum; discomfort <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1215" title="1215"></span>caused by certain foods; daily food intake; the use of alcohol and tobacco, including smokeless chewing tobacco; and the need to wear dentures or a partial plate.

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Nurse-Led Educational Intervention for Patients with Functional Constipation</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Shen, Q., Zhu, H., Jiang, G., et&#x00A0;al. (2018). Nurse-led self-management educational intervention improves symptoms of patients with functional constipation. <em>Western Journal of Nursing Research</em>, <em>40</em>(60), 874&#x2013;888.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Functional constipation (FC) is described as a persistent problem with defecation that may be characterized by a decrease in bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete bowel emptying post defection, or difficulty having bowel movements. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of a self-management educational intervention on patients with FC and to compare outcomes to a control group that received routine nursing care.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The pretest/posttest scores of <em>The Constipation Assessment Scale</em> and <em>The Constipation Cognition Scale</em> were collected on admission, discharge, and 1-month post discharge for 66 eligible participants who were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. Both groups received routine nursing care for constipation. In addition, the intervention group received the following support: visits from the multidisciplinary intervention team, dietary and lifestyle evaluation, education, assistance in developing a self-management plan, timely consultations and weekly group meetings both inpatient and outpatient, and the option to include family members in sessions. Patients in the intervention group were also encouraged to maintain a diary to document food and lifestyle choices. Members of the educational intervention team checked the diaries daily during hospitalization and provided follow-up via a phone call 1 week and then 1 month after discharge.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The constipation scores of all clinical symptoms were lower (improved) in the intervention group at 1 month after discharge (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.05). Additionally, the intervention group had a higher number of patients with good health habits, including diet, exercise, and defecation habits, and proper use of laxatives (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.05).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The findings of this study suggest that a multifaceted educational intervention can improve clinical symptoms and adherence behaviors, and promote healthy lifestyle choices in patients with FC. Nurses can apply findings to better manage FC, educate patients to improve outcomes, and tailor interventions to best meet the needs of this patient population.</p>

<p class="indent">Past and current medication use and any previous diagnostic studies, treatments, or surgery are noted. Current nutritional status is assessed via history; laboratory tests (complete metabolic panel including liver function studies, triglyceride, iron studies, and complete blood count [CBC]) are obtained. History of the use of tobacco and alcohol includes details about type, amount, length of use, and the date of discontinuation, if any. The nurse and patient discuss changes in appetite or eating patterns and any unexplained weight gain or loss over the past year. The nurse also asks questions about psychosocial, spiritual, or cultural factors that may be affecting the patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1577">Physical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The physical examination includes assessment of the mouth, abdomen, and rectum and requires a good source of light, full exposure of the abdomen, warm hands with short fingernails, and a comfortable and relaxed patient with an empty bladder.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Oral Cavity Inspection and Palpation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Dentures should be removed to allow good visualization of the entire oral cavity.</p>
<p class="h7">Lips</p>
<p class="nonindent">The examination begins with inspection of the lips for moisture, hydration, color, texture, symmetry, and the presence of ulcerations or fissures. The lips should be moist, pink, smooth, and symmetric. The patient is instructed to open the mouth wide; a tongue blade is then inserted to expose the buccal mucosa for an assessment of color and lesions. Stensen duct of each parotid gland is visible as a small red dot in the buccal mucosa next to the upper molars.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Gums</p>
<p class="nonindent">The gums are inspected for inflammation, bleeding, retraction, and discoloration. The odor of the breath is also noted. The hard palate is examined for color and shape.</p>
<p class="h7">Tongue</p>
<p class="nonindent">The dorsum (back) of the tongue is inspected for texture, color, and lesions. A thin white coat and large, vallate papillae in a &#x201C;V&#x201D; formation on the distal portion of the dorsum of the tongue are normal findings. The patient is instructed to protrude the tongue and move it laterally. This provides the examiner with an opportunity to estimate the tongue&#x2019;s size as well as its symmetry and strength (to assess the integrity of the 12th cranial nerve [hypoglossal nerve]).</p>
<p class="indent">Further inspection of the ventral surface of the tongue and the floor of the mouth is accomplished by asking the patient to touch the roof of the mouth with the tip of the tongue. Any lesions of the mucosa or any abnormalities involving the frenulum or superficial veins on the undersurface of the tongue are assessed for location, size, color, and pain. This is a common area for oral cancer, which presents as a white or red plaque, lesions, ulcers, or nodules (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A tongue blade is used to depress the tongue for adequate visualization of the pharynx. It is pressed firmly beyond the midpoint of the tongue; proper placement avoids a gagging response. The patient is told to tip the head back, open the mouth wide, take a deep breath, and say &#x201C;ah.&#x201D; Often, this flattens the posterior tongue and briefly allows a full view of the tonsils, uvula, and posterior pharynx. These structures are inspected for color, symmetry, and evidence of exudate, ulceration, or enlargement. Normally, the uvula and soft palate rise symmetrically with a deep inspiration upon saying &#x201C;ah&#x201D;; this indicates an intact vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve).</p>
<p class="indent">A complete assessment of the oral cavity is essential because many disorders, such as cancer, diabetes, and immunosuppressive conditions resulting from medication therapy or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, may be manifested by changes in the oral cavity, including stomatitis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Abdominal Inspection, Auscultation, Percussion, and Palpation <img class="m" src="images/watch.jpg" alt="icon" /></h6>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bfad67b6c920" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Assessing the Abdomen</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient lies supine with knees flexed slightly for inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation of the abdomen. For the purposes of examination and documentation, the abdomen can be divided into either four quadrants or nine regions (<a href="#ff38-4">Fig. 38-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Consistent use of one of these mapping methods results in a thorough evaluation of the abdomen and appropriate documentation. The four-quadrant method involves the use of an imaginary line drawn vertically from the sternum to the pubis through the umbilicus and a horizontal line drawn across the abdomen through the umbilicus. Inspection is performed first, noting skin changes, nodules, lesions, scarring, discolorations, inflammation, bruising, or striae. Lesions are of particular importance, because GI diseases <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1216" title="1216"></span>often produce skin changes. The contour and symmetry of the abdomen are noted, and any localized bulging, distention, or peristaltic waves are identified. Expected contours of the anterior abdominal wall can be described as flat, rounded, or scaphoid.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff38-4">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff38-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff38-4.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;38-4 &#x2022;</span> Division of the abdomen into four quadrants or nine regions.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Auscultation always precedes percussion and palpation, because they may alter sounds. Auscultation is used to determine the character, location, and frequency of bowel sounds and to identify vascular sounds. Bowel sounds are assessed using the diaphragm of the stethoscope for soft clicks and gurgling sounds (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). The frequency and character of the sounds are usually heard as clicks and gurgles that occur irregularly and range from 5 to 30 per minute. Bowel sounds are designated as normal, hyperactive, hypoactive, or absent. The nurse should auscultate for a minimum of 5 minutes; listening for at least 1 minute in each quadrant to confirm the absence of bowel sounds (<a href="c38-sec03.xhtml#bib2858">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Using the bell of the stethoscope, any bruits in the aortic, renal, iliac, and femoral arteries are noted. Friction rubs are high pitched and can be heard over the liver and spleen during respiration. Borborygmus (&#x201C;stomach growling&#x201D;) is heard as a loud prolonged gurgle.</p>
<p class="indent">Percussion is used to assess the size and density of the abdominal organs and to detect the presence of air-filled, fluid-filled, or solid masses. Percussion is used either independently or concurrently with palpation because it can validate palpation findings. All quadrants are percussed for overall tympani and dullness. Tympani is the sound that results from the presence of air in the stomach and small intestines; dullness is heard over organs and solid masses. The use of light palpation is appropriate for identifying areas of tenderness or muscular resistance, and deep palpation is used to identify masses. Testing for rebound tenderness is not performed by many examiners because it can cause severe pain; light percussion is used instead to produce a mild localized response when peritoneal irritation is present.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Rectal Inspection and Palpation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The final part of the examination is evaluation of the terminal portions of the GI tract, the rectum, perianal region, and anus. The anal canal is approximately 2.5 to 4 cm (1 to 1.6 inches) in length and opens into the perineum. Concentric rings of muscle, the internal and external sphincters, normally keep the anal canal securely closed. Gloves, water-soluble lubrication, a penlight, and drapes are necessary tools for the evaluation. Although the rectal examination is generally uncomfortable and often embarrassing for the patient, it is a mandatory part of every thorough examination. For women, the rectal examination may be part of the gynecologic examination. Positions for the rectal examination include knee-chest, left lateral with hips and knees flexed, or standing with hips flexed and upper body supported by the examination table. Most patients are comfortable on the right side with knees brought up to the chest. External examination includes inspection for lumps, rashes, inflammation, excoriation, tears, scars, pilonidal dimpling, and tufts of hair at the pilonidal area. The discovery of tenderness, inflammation, or both should alert the examiner to the possibility of a pilonidal cyst, perianal abscess, or anorectal fistula or fissure. The patient&#x2019;s buttocks are carefully spread and visually inspected until the patient has relaxed the external sphincter control. The patient is asked to bear down, thus allowing the ready appearance of fistulas, fissures, rectal prolapse, polyps, and internal hemorrhoids. Internal examination is performed with a gloved lubricated index finger inserted into the anal canal while the patient bears down. The tone of the sphincter is noted, as are any nodules or irregularities of the anal ring. Because this is an uncomfortable part of the examination for most patients, the patient is encouraged to focus on deep breathing and visualization of a pleasant setting during the brief examination.</p>
