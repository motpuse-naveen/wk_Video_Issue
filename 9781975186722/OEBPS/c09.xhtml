<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">acute pain:</span> pain that results from tissue damage that generally abates as healing occurs; serves as a warning signal that something is wrong or needs attention</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">adjuvant analgesic agent:</span> a substance or medication added to an analgesic medication regimen to improve analgesia (<em>synonym:</em> co-analgesic agent)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">agonist:</span> a medication that binds to an opioid receptor mimicking the way endogenous substances provide analgesia</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">agonist&#x2013;antagonist:</span> a type of opioid (e.g., nalbuphine and butorphanol) that binds to the kappa opioid receptor site acting as an agonist (capable of producing analgesia) and simultaneously to the mu opioid receptor site acting as an antagonist (reversing mu agonist effects)</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">allodynia:</span> pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain, such as touch; typically experienced in the skin around areas affected by nerve injury and commonly seen with many neuropathic pain syndromes</p>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">mu agonist:</span> any opioid that binds to the mu opioid receptor subtype and produces analgesic effects (e.g., morphine); used interchangeably with the terms <em>full agonist, pure agonist,</em> and <em>morphinelike medication</em></p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">multimodal analgesia or multimodal pain management:</span> the intentional, concurrent use of more than one pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic intervention with different methods of action with the goal to achieve better analgesia while using lower doses of medications with fewer adverse effects</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">neuraxial:</span> of the central nervous system</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">neuropathic (pathophysiologic) pain:</span> pain caused by injury or dysfunction (lesion or disease) of one or more nerves of the peripheral or central nervous systems with resultant impaired processing of sensory input</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">neuroplasticity:</span> the ability of the peripheral and central nervous systems to change both structure and function as a result of noxious stimuli</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">nociceptive (physiologic) pain:</span> pain that is sustained by ongoing activation of the sensory system that conducts the perception of noxious stimuli; implies the existence of damage to somatic or visceral tissues sufficient to activate the nociceptive system</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">nociceptor:</span> a type of primary afferent neuron that has the ability to respond to a noxious stimulus or to a stimulus that would be noxious if prolonged</p>

<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">opioid dose&#x2013;sparing effect:</span> occurs when a nonopioid or co-analgesic medication is prescribed in addition to an opioid, enabling the opioid dose to be lower without diminishing analgesic effects</p>
<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">opioid-induced hyperalgesia:</span> a phenomenon in which exposure to an opioid induces increased sensitivity, or a lowered threshold, to the neural activity conducting pain perception; it is the &#x201C;flip side&#x201D; of tolerance</p>

<p class="nonindent">Pain serves as a survival tactic that guides individuals not only to avoid damage in the moment, but also to learn to avoid danger in the future (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib696">Martin, Power, Boyle, et al., 2017</a>). Nurses in all settings play a key role in the management of pain as experts in assessment, medication administration, and patient education. They are uniquely positioned to assume this role as members of the health care team most consistently at the patient&#x2019;s bedside. These characteristics have led to nurses&#x2019; distinction as the primary managers of patients who are experiencing pain (<a href="c09-sec03.xhtml#bib734">Curtis &#x0026; Wrona, 2018</a>).</p>
