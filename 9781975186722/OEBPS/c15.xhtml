<p class="glossary_hang_text"><span class="number_ol0">moderate sedation:</span> previously referred to as conscious sedation, involves the use of sedation to depress the level of consciousness without altering the patient&#x2019;s ability to maintain a patent airway and to respond to physical stimuli and verbal commands</p>

<p class="nonindent">The intraoperative experience has undergone many changes and advances that make it safer and less disturbing to patients. Even with these advances, anesthesia and surgery still place the patient at risk for several complications or adverse events. Consciousness or full awareness, mobility, protective biologic functions, and personal control are totally or partially relinquished by the patient when entering the operating room (OR). Staff from the departments of anesthesia, nursing, and surgery work collaboratively to implement professional standards of care, to control iatrogenic and individual risks, to prevent complications, and to promote high-quality patient outcomes.</p>
