<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps2">A</span> 56-year-old woman diagnosed with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung arrives at her outpatient palliative care appointment with delirium, lethargy, and confusion. Her blood work is drawn, and she is transferred to the inpatient oncology unit where you work for further evaluation. The admission profile reports that she is prescribed gabapentin 300&#x00A0;mg three times daily and fentanyl 50 mcg transdermal patch to be replaced every 72 hours. Upon assessment you find the patient confused and unable to rate her pain. The family is concerned about the confusion and worried that she is unable to tolerate the medications ordered for pain. Because this patient has many underlying components to her care, you request a case conference with the family, palliative care team, pharmacist, and the oncologist to determine the best plan of care at this time.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care,</em></strong> <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration,</em></strong> <strong><em>evidence-based practice,</em></strong> <strong><em>quality improvement,</em></strong> <strong><em>safety,</em></strong> and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
