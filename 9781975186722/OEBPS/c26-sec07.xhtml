<h4 class="h4" id="s975">Upper Extremity Arterial Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Arterial stenosis and occlusions occur less frequently in the upper extremities (arms) than in the legs, and cause less severe symptoms because the collateral circulation is significantly better in the arms. The arms also have less muscle mass and are not subjected to the workload of the legs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s976">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Stenosis and occlusions in the upper extremity result from atherosclerosis or trauma. The stenosis usually occurs at the origin of the vessel proximal to the vertebral artery, which results in the vertebral artery becoming the dominant vessel for blood flow. The patient typically complains of arm fatigue and pain with exercise (forearm claudication), inability to hold or grasp objects (e.g., combing hair, placing objects on shelves above the head), and occasionally difficulty driving.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may develop a &#x201C;subclavian steal&#x201D; syndrome characterized by reverse flow in the vertebral and basilar arteries to provide blood flow to the arm. This syndrome may cause vertebrobasilar (cerebral) symptoms, including vertigo, ataxia, syncope, or bilateral visual changes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s977">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Findings on assessment include coolness and pallor of the affected extremity, decreased capillary refill, and a difference in arm blood pressures of more than 15 to 20 mm Hg (<a href="c26-sec21.xhtml#bib1983">Zierler &#x0026; Dawson, 2016</a>). Noninvasive studies performed to evaluate upper extremity arterial occlusions include upper and forearm blood pressure determinations and duplex ultrasonography to identify the anatomic location of the lesion and to evaluate the hemodynamics of blood flow. Transcranial Doppler evaluation is performed to evaluate the intracranial circulation and to detect any siphoning of blood flow from the posterior circulation to provide blood flow to the affected arm. If an endovascular or surgical procedure is planned, a diagnostic arteriogram may be necessary.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s978">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If a short focal lesion is identified in an upper extremity artery, a PTA with possible stent or stent graft placement may be performed. If the lesion involves the subclavian artery with documented siphoning of blood flow from the intracranial circulation and an endovascular procedure is not possible, a surgical bypass may be performed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s979">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing assessment involves bilateral comparison of upper arm blood pressures (obtained by stethoscope and Doppler), radial, ulnar, and brachial pulses, motor and sensory function, temperature, color changes, and capillary refill every 2 hours. Disappearance of a pulse or Doppler flow that had been present may indicate an acute occlusion of the vessel, and the primary provider is notified immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">After surgery or an endovascular procedure, the arm is kept at heart level or elevated, with the fingers at the highest level. Pulses are monitored with Doppler assessment of the arterial flow every hour for 2 hours and then every shift. Blood pressure (obtained by stethoscope and Doppler) is also assessed every hour for 4 hours and then every shift. Motor and sensory function, warmth, color, and capillary refill are monitored with each arterial flow (pulse) assessment.</p>
