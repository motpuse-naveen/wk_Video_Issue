<h4 class="h4" id="s2625">Viral Skin Infections</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Cutaneous manifestations may ensue because of viral infections. Viruses implicated in causing dermatologic disorders include the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the herpes simplex viruses, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m3">Herpes Zoster</p>
<p class="nonindent">Herpes zoster, also called <em>shingles,</em> is an infection caused by VZV. The disease is characterized by painful vesicular eruptions along the areas of distribution of dermatomes (sensory nerves) from one or more posterior ganglia. After a case of primary varicella (chickenpox) runs its course, the VZV lies dormant inside nerve cells near the brain and spinal cord. Later, when the latent virus becomes reactivated because of declining cellular immunity, it travels by way of the peripheral nerves to the skin, where it replicates and create a red rash of small, fluid-filled blisters.</p>
<p class="indent">It is thought that during the aging process, natural immunity to the varicella virus wanes, facilitating viral reactivation. Herpes zoster develops naturally over the lifetime of about 10% to 20% of all adults who had chickenpox earlier in life, usually after 50 years of age. The rates of occurrence tend to be the same in both men and women but are slightly lower in Black adults than White adults. There is an increased frequency of herpes zoster infections in patients with weakened immune systems, including those with HIV infection <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1837" title="1837"></span>and in those with cancer. In these patients, the infection can become widespread and cause significant complications (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4057">Janniger, Eastern, Hospenthal, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2626">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Manifestations typically occur in three phases, including the preeruptive, acute eruptive, and postherpetic neuralgia phases. During the preeruptive phase, the previously dormant VZV becomes reactivated within the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. Manifestations that follow, therefore, tend to follow the dermatomes that correspond with the ganglia that are affected. The patient will typically complain of pain, or sometimes pruritus or paresthesias, over the sensory region that follows affected dermatomes. This phase lasts from 1 to 10 days, with 48 hours being typical (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The acute eruptive phase is heralded by the appearance of unilateral patchy erythematous areas in the dermatomal area that is affected. Vesicles develop that appear initially clear, then become cloudy, and eventually rupture and crust (<a href="#ff56-6">Fig. 56-6</a>). The pain that accompanies this stage is typically described as severe and unrelenting. This phase typically lasts between 10 and 15 days (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The last phase&#x2014;postherpetic neuralgia&#x2014;is variable in terms of both duration and manifestations. The pain is typically localized to the dermatomal area that was affected. Approximately 50% of adults older than 60 years with herpes zoster experience postherpetic neuralgia pain for longer than 60 days (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a rare subtype of herpes zoster that causes severe consequences. Typically in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, a branch of the trigeminal nerve is affected that innervates the ocular and periocular structures. This may cause significant pain and morbid ocular complications, including blindness (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2627">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The effects of herpes zoster can be diminished if oral antiviral agents such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir are given within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms; the prescribed antiviral agent then must continue to be taken for 7 to 10&#x00A0;days in patients who are immune competent. IV acyclovir may be indicated in patients who are immune compromised; length of therapy may continue for up to 21 days (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The goals of herpes zoster management are to relieve the pain and to reduce or avoid complications, which include infection, scarring, and postherpetic neuralgia and eye complications. Pain is controlled with analgesic agents because adequate pain control during the acute phase helps prevent persistent pain patterns. Analgesic agents may include NSAIDs or acetaminophen for mild pain, or opioids such as oxycodone for moderate to severe pain (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Beuscher, Reeves, &#x0026; Harrell, 2017</a>). Systemic corticosteroids have traditionally been prescribed; however, their routine use is currently controversial as benefits have not been seen in research studies (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>). Patients with postherpetic neuralgia may be prescribed pregabalin or gabapentin to mitigate its unpleasant effects. Alternative agents that might be prescribed to treat postherpetic neuralgia include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline) (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Beuscher et al., 2017</a>). Patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus require emergent treatment by an ophthalmologist (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Since 1995, the widespread vaccination of children with the VZV vaccine has led to a marked reduction in the incidence of primary varicella, which presumably will result in marked decrease in rates of herpes zoster in the future. A zoster vaccine live (ZVL) was introduced to boost VZV cellular immunity in adults 60 years of age and older in 2006. Since that time, consensus guidelines have lowered the age for vaccination to 50 years, and include those with a history of herpes zoster, because it may recur (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>). A nonlive, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revised its herpes zoster vaccination guidelines to recommend that adults 50 years of age and older should receive 2 doses of RZV 2 to 6 months apart, regardless of whether or not they have previously received the ZVL vaccine. For those adults who have received the ZVL vaccine, they should not receive a first dose of the RZV vaccine until at least 2 months have elapsed from receipt of the ZVL vaccine (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4034">Dooling, Guo, Patel, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2628">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient and family members are instructed about the importance of taking antiviral agents as prescribed and in keeping follow-up appointments with the primary provider. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s discomfort and response to medication and collaborates with the primary provider to make necessary adjustments to the treatment regimen. Vesicles and rashes may be soothed by applying OTC calamine lotion or 5% aluminum acetate (Burow&#x2019;s solution) wet dressings for 30 to 60 minutes four to six times daily (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Janniger et al., 2020</a>). The patient is educated about how to follow proper hand hygiene techniques to avoid spreading the virus.</p>
<p class="indent">Diversionary activities and relaxation techniques are encouraged to ensure restful sleep and to alleviate discomfort. A caregiver may be required to assist with dressings, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1838" title="1838"></span>particularly if the patient is an older adult and unable to apply them. Food preparation for patients who cannot care for themselves or prepare nourishing meals must be arranged.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m4">Herpes Simplex</p>
<p class="nonindent">Herpes simplex is a common skin infection. There are two types of the causative virus, which are identified by viral typing. In general, herpes simplex type 1 occurs on the skin of the lips, mouth, gums, or tongue (or on the skin around the mouth) and type 2 occurs in the genital area, but both viral types can be found in both locations. See <a href="c18.xhtml">Chapters 18</a> and <a href="c51.xhtml">51</a> for discussion of herpes simplex type 1 and type 2, respectively.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m5"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtv1.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">SARS-CoV-2, the virion implicated in causing the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily manifests with respiratory ailments in patients who are infected (e.g., pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure), as its name implies. However, there have been notable dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19; these have been tracked by an international registry of patients with cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, sponsored by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the International League of Dermatologic Societies (ILDS). At the time of this writing, the registry has reported dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 among 716 patients from 31 countries (Freeman, McMahon, Lipoff, et al., 2020b). Although many diverse cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been reported, one that is of particular note involves perniolike acral (fingers, toes) skin lesions (Freeman, McMahon, Lipoff, et al., 2020a; Freeman et al., 2020b).</p>
<p class="indent">Pernio (chilblains) is a dermatologic inflammatory manifestation of the superficial vasculature that occurs in response to cold. It exhibits as edema and erythema, sometimes with plaque formation, of affected fingers or toes; ulcerations are sometimes present. The unique perniolike acral manifestations of COVID-19, sometimes called <em>COVID toes</em>, are not related to cold/ambient temperature and are not believed to be caused by a vascular response. At the present time, researchers posit that its underlying cause may be idiopathic (unknown), or related to a simple inflammatory response, or related to a prothrombotic coagulopathy incited by the infection (Freeman et al., 2020a). Irrespective of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, the perniolike acral skin lesions apparently have a predilection for children and young adults rather than middle-aged or older adults with COVID-19. It more commonly affects the toes than the fingers, and in some instances, is the sole manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Freeman et al., 2020a; Freeman et al., 2020b). Furthermore, the infection tends to be mild and generally may be managed on an outpatient basis (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for discussion of management of mild COVID-19). Based upon these observations, it is recommended that patients who are otherwise apparently healthy but who present with perniolike acral skin lesions should be tested for COVID-19, regardless of their history of COVID-19 exposure or the presence or absence of other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Feldman &#x0026; Freeman, 2020</a>).</p>
