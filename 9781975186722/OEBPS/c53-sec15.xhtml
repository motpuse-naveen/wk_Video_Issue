<p class="nonindent">A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;varicocele:&lt;/b&gt; an abnormal dilation of the veins of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum (the network of veins from the testis and the epididymis, which constitute part of the spermatic cord)">varicocele</button></strong> is an abnormal dilation of the pampiniform venous plexus and the internal spermatic vein in the scrotum (the network of veins from the testis and the epididymis, which constitute part of the spermatic cord). Varicoceles occur in approximately 15% to 20% of healthy adult men and 40% of men with infertility; the large majority (95%) are in the left testicle because incompetent valves are more common in the left internal spermatic veins (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Norris, 2019</a>). Although men may report scrotal pain, tenderness, heaviness in the inguinal area, and infertility, varicoceles are often asymptomatic.</p>
<p class="indent">If the varicocele is mild and fertility is not an issue, no treatment is required, and a scrotal support is usually sufficient to relieve symptoms of heaviness. If the condition results in ongoing distressing symptoms or fertility is an issue, the varicocele can be corrected surgically. Postprocedural education and care include an ice pack applied to the scrotum for the first few hours after surgery to relieve edema, dressing removal after 48 hours, nonstrenuous exercise for the first 2 days, scrotal support, pain control, and reporting complications such as infection and hematoma.</p>
