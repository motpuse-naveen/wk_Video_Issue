<h5 class="h5" id="s526">Health History</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The health history initially focuses on the patient&#x2019;s presenting problem and associated symptoms. In conducting the history, the nurse should explore the onset, location, duration, character, aggravating and alleviating factors, radiation (if relevant), and timing of the presenting problem and associated signs and symptoms. The nurse should also explore how these factors impact the patient&#x2019;s activities of daily living, usual work and family activities, and quality of life.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Common Symptoms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The major signs and symptoms of respiratory disease are dyspnea, cough, sputum production, chest pain, wheezing, and hemoptysis. During the health history, the nurse should also consider nonpulmonary diseases when evaluating symptoms, as these symptoms may occur with a variety of other illnesses.</p>

</div>
<p class="h7">Dyspnea</p>
<p class="nonindent">The official American Thoracic Society Statement (2012) defines <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dyspnea:&lt;/b&gt; subjective experience that describes an uncomfortable or painful breathing sensation when either at rest or while walking or climbing stairs; also commonly referred to as shortness of breath">dyspnea</button></strong> as a subjective feeling of discomfort while breathing; its causes may include multiple physiologic, psychological, environmental, or social factors (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1358">Parshall, Schwartzstein, Adams, et&#x00A0;al., 2012</a>). In general, acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than do chronic diseases. Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity), acute respiratory obstruction, allergic reaction, or myocardial infarction. In patients who are immobilized, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism (PE). Dyspnea and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tachypnea:&lt;/b&gt; abnormally rapid respirations">tachypnea</button></strong> (abnormally rapid respirations) accompanied by progressive <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypoxemia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in arterial oxygen tension in the blood">hypoxemia</button></strong> (low blood oxygen level) in a person who has recently experienced lung trauma, shock, cardiopulmonary bypass, or multiple blood transfusions may signal ARDS. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;orthopnea:&lt;/b&gt; shortness of breath when lying flat; relieved by sitting or standing">Orthopnea</button></strong> (shortness of breath when lying flat, relieved by sitting or standing) may be found in patients with heart disease and occasionally in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD. Dyspnea associated with noisy breathing may result from a narrowing of the airway or localized obstruction of a major bronchus by a tumor or foreign body. The high-pitched sound heard (usually on inspiration) when someone is breathing through a partially blocked upper airway is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stridor:&lt;/b&gt; continuous, high-pitched, musical sound heard on inspiration, best heard over the neck; may be heard without use of a stethoscope, secondary to upper airway obstruction">stridor</button></strong><strong>.</strong> To help determine the cause of dyspnea, the nurse should ask the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Is the shortness of breath related to other symptoms? Is a cough present?</span></li>
<li><span>Was the onset of shortness of breath sudden or gradual?</span></li>
<li><span>At what time of day or night does the shortness of breath occur?</span></li>
<li><span>Is the shortness of breath worse when lying flat?</span></li>
<li><span>How much exertion triggers shortness of breath? Does it occur with exercise? Climbing stairs? At rest?</span></li>
<li><span>How severe is the shortness of breath? On a scale of 0 to 10, if 0 is not at all breathless and 10 is very breathless, how hard is it to breathe?</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Because patients use a variety of terms to describe breathlessness, the nurse must explore what these terms mean to each patient. The use of a standardized tool to assess dyspnea, as part of the routine nursing assessment, can be beneficial (Fig.&#x00A0;17-6). It is especially important to assess the patient&#x2019;s rating of the intensity or distress of breathlessness, what breathing feels like, and its impact on the patient&#x2019;s general health, function, and quality of life (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1353">Baker, DeSanto-Madeya, &#x0026; Banzett, 2017</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct17-5">Chart&#x00A0;17-5</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Cough</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cough is a reflex that protects the lungs from the accumulation of secretions or the inhalation of foreign bodies. Its presence or absence can be a diagnostic clue because some disorders cause coughing and others suppress it. The cough reflex may be impaired by weakness or paralysis of the respiratory muscles, prolonged inactivity, the presence of a nasogastric tube, or depressed function of the brain&#x2019;s medullary centers (e.g., anesthesia, brain disorders).</p>
<p class="indent">Cough results from irritation or inflammation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract and is associated with multiple pulmonary disorders. Mucus, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page472" title="472"></span>pus, blood, or an airborne irritant, such as smoke or a gas, may stimulate the cough reflex. Common causes of cough include asthma, gastrointestinal reflux disease, infection, and side effects of medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">To help determine the cause of the cough, the nurse inquires about the onset and time of coughing. Coughing at night may indicate the onset of left-sided heart failure or bronchial asthma. A cough in the morning with sputum production may indicate bronchitis. A cough that worsens when the patient is supine suggests postnasal drip (rhinosinusitis). Coughing after food intake may indicate aspiration of material into the tracheobronchial tree or reflux. A cough of recent onset is usually from an acute infection.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the character of the cough and associated symptoms. A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection of viral origin, or it may be a side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. An irritative, high-pitched cough can be caused by laryngotracheitis. A brassy cough is the result of a tracheal lesion, and a severe or changing cough may indicate bronchogenic carcinoma. Pleuritic chest pain that accompanies coughing may indicate pleural or chest wall (musculoskeletal) involvement. Violent coughing causes bronchial spasm, obstruction, and further irritation of the bronchi and may result in syncope (fainting).</p>

Therefore, the nurse should explore how a chronic cough impacts all aspects of the patient&#x2019;s life.</p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Dyspnea Assessment</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Baker, K. M., DeSanto-Madeya, S., &#x0026; Banzett, R. B. (2017). Routine dyspnea assessment and documentation: Nurses&#x2019; experience yields wide acceptance. <em>BMC Nursing</em><em>,</em> <em>16</em>(3), 1&#x2013;11.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study aims to explore nurses&#x2019; approaches to dyspnea assessment, their perception of patient response, and their perception of the utility and burden of dyspnea measurement.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a qualitative, descriptive study utilizing a three-part assessment of practice: a series of focus group interviews, a time-motion observation, and a randomized, anonymous online survey. A convenience sample of 63 nurses from six medical-surgical units participated in 12 half-hour focus group sessions. The focus group included questions about the process nurses used for assessment of dyspnea, views on the importance of dyspnea assessment and awareness, patients&#x2019; abilities to rate and use a dyspnea scale, impact of routine assessment on workflow, and suggestions for improvement. Focus group sessions were conducted during regular work shifts and were recorded. Forty registered nurses representing 14 medical-surgical inpatient units were randomly selected for participation in the time-motion study. For this observation, a clinical nurse specialist recorded the time nurses spent assessing and documenting pain and dyspnea during routine morning nursing assessment of patients. The online survey addressed issues raised during the focus group sessions. Seventy registered nurses, from 14 inpatient medical-surgical units, were randomly selected to complete the anonymous, online survey.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nursing assessment of dyspnea and pain took less than 1 min. Overwhelmingly, most of the nurses surveyed (94%) reported understanding the importance of assessing dyspnea. They described assessment of dyspnea as &#x201C;easy&#x201D; or &#x201C;very easy&#x201D; to complete and that the utilization of an assessment tool enhanced awareness of dyspnea, improved workflow, and standardized documentation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study support the use of a standardized tool to assess dyspnea as part of routine nursing assessment of patients.</p>
</div>
<p class="h7">Sputum Production</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sputum production is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant and often results from persistent coughing. It may also be associated with a nasal discharge. The nature of the sputum is often indicative of its cause. A profuse amount of purulent sputum (thick and yellow, green, or rust colored) or a change in color of the sputum is a common sign of a bacterial infection. Thin, mucoid sputum frequently results from viral bronchitis. A gradual increase of sputum over time may occur with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis. Pink-tinged mucoid sputum suggests a lung tumor. Profuse, frothy, pink material, often welling up into the throat, may indicate pulmonary edema. Foul-smelling sputum and bad breath point to the presence of a lung abscess, bronchiectasis, or an infection caused by fusospirochetal or other anaerobic organisms.</p>
<p class="h7">Chest Pain</p>
<p class="nonindent">Chest pain or discomfort may be associated with pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal disease or anxiety. Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharp, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent. The pain usually is felt on the side where the pathologic process is located, although it may be referred elsewhere&#x2014;for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.</p>
<p class="indent">Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary infarction, or pleurisy, or as a late symptom of bronchogenic carcinoma. In carcinoma, the pain may be dull and persistent because the cancer has invaded the chest wall, mediastinum, or spine.</p>
<p class="indent">Lung disease does not always cause thoracic pain because the lungs and the visceral pleura lack sensory nerves and are insensitive to pain stimuli. However, the parietal pleura have a rich supply of sensory nerves that are stimulated by inflammation and stretching of the membrane. Pleuritic pain from irritation of the parietal pleura is sharp and seems to &#x201C;catch&#x201D; on inspiration; patients often describe it as being &#x201C;like the stabbing of a knife.&#x201D; Patients are more comfortable when they lay on the affected side because this position splints the chest wall, limits expansion and contraction of the lung, and reduces the friction between the injured or diseased pleurae on that side. Pain associated with cough may be reduced manually by splinting the rib cage.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses the onset, quality, intensity, and radiation of pain and identifies and explores precipitating factors and their relationship to the patient&#x2019;s position. In addition, the nurse must assess the relationship of pain to the inspiratory and expiratory phases of respiration (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> for further discussion on assessment of pain).</p>
<p class="h7">Wheezing</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wheezing is a high-pitched, musical sound which is continuous, meaning it is heard on either expiration (asthma) or inspiration (bronchitis). It is often the major finding in a patient with bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing (see later discussion under Thoracic Auscultation).</p>
<p class="h7">Hemoptysis</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hemoptysis:&lt;/b&gt; expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract">Hemoptysis</button></strong> is the expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract. It can present as small to moderate blood-stained sputum to a large hemorrhage and always warrants further investigation. The onset of hemoptysis is usually sudden, and it may be intermittent or continuous. The most common causes are:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Pulmonary infection</span></li>
<li><span>Carcinoma of the lung</span></li>
<li><span>Abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels</span></li>
<li><span>Pulmonary artery or vein abnormalities</span></li>
<li><span>PE or infarction</span></li></ul>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 473</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page474" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="474">p. 474</span></div>
<p class="indent">The nurse must determine the source of the bleeding, as the term <em>hemoptysis</em> is reserved for blood coming from the respiratory tract. Potential sources of bleeding include the gums, nasopharynx, lungs, or stomach. The nurse may be the only witness to the episode, and when evaluating the bleeding episode, the following points should be considered:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Bloody sputum from the nose or the nasopharynx is usually preceded by considerable sniffing, with blood possibly appearing in the nose.</span></li>
<li><span>Blood from the lung is usually bright red, frothy, and mixed with sputum. Initial symptoms include a tickling sensation in the throat, a salty taste, a burning or bubbling sensation in the chest, and perhaps chest pain, in which case, the patient tends to splint the bleeding side. This blood has an alkaline pH (greater than 7).</span></li>
<li><span>Blood from the stomach is vomited rather than expectorated, may be mixed with food, and is usually much darker and often referred to as &#x201C;coffee ground emesis.&#x201D; This blood has an acid pH (less than 7).</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Past Health, Social, and Family History</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the presenting problem and associated symptoms, the history should also focus on the patient&#x2019;s health, personal, and social history, and the family health history. Specific questions are asked about childhood illnesses, immunizations (including the most recent influenza and pneumonia vaccinations), medical conditions, injuries, hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies, and current medications (including over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies). Personal and social history addresses issues such as diet, exercise, sleep, recreational habits, and religion. Psychosocial factors that may affect the patient are also explored (<a href="#ct17-6">Chart&#x00A0;17-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assesses for risk factors and genetic factors that may contribute to the patient&#x2019;s lung condition (<a href="#ct17-7">Charts 17-7</a> and <a href="#ct17-8">17-8</a>). Many lung disorders are related to or exacerbated by tobacco smoke; therefore, smoking history (including exposure to secondhand smoke) is also obtained. Smoking history is usually expressed in pack-years, which is the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day times the number of years the patient has smoked. It is important to find out whether the patient is still smoking or when the patient quit smoking. The nurse should also ask patients whether they use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes, e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars, or any other smokeless tobacco products. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized a rule that extended its regulatory authority to all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and pipe tobacco. The new rule mandates health warnings on products, bans free samples, and restricts youth (those under the age of 18) access to newly regulated tobacco products. The FDA has not found ENDS to be safe or effective in helping smokers curb the habit, as previously marketed by some manufacturers. The FDA has approved five forms of nicotine replacement therapy including nicotine gum, nicotine skin patches, nicotine lozenges, nicotine oral inhaled products, and nicotine nasal spray (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1351">American Lung Association, 2020</a>). The American Lung Association views ENDS as a public health threat and calls for additional research regarding the risks and long-term effects to better understand potential risks (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1349">American Lung Association, 2019</a>). In January 2018, The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on the public health consequences of e-cigarettes. The report presented 47 conclusions from a review of 800 studies and concluded that using e-cigarettes causes health risks. E-cigarettes contain and emit a number of potentially toxic substances such as propylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde, among others. Acrolein, also used as a weed killer, is known to cause acute lung injury, COPD, asthma, and lung cancer. Additionally, e-cigarette use is associated with an increased risk for cough, wheeze, and asthma exacerbations in adolescents (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1362">The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018</a>). Differences in socioeconomic factors, rooted in race and ethnicity, may predispose certain groups to greater burdens related to lung disease and should also be considered (<a href="#ct17-9">Chart&#x00A0;17-9</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s527">Physical Assessment of the Respiratory System</h5>
<h6 class="h6">General Appearance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient&#x2019;s general appearance may give clues to respiratory status. In particular, the nurse inspects for clubbing of the fingers and notes skin color.</p>
<p class="h7">Clubbing of the Fingers</p>
<p class="nonindent">Clubbing of the fingers is a change in the normal nail bed. It appears as sponginess of the nail bed and loss of the nail bed angle (<a href="#ff17-7">Fig.&#x00A0;17-7</a>). It is a sign of lung disease that is found in patients with chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, or malignancies of the lung. Clubbing can also be seen in congenital heart disease and other chronic infections or inflammatory conditions, such as endocarditis or inflammatory bowel disease (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Hogan-Quigley, Palm, &#x0026; Bickley, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Cyanosis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cyanosis, a bluish coloring of the skin, is a very late indicator of hypoxia. The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. Cyanosis <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page476" title="476"></span>appears when there is at least 5 g/dL of unoxygenated hemoglobin. A patient with a hemoglobin level of 15 g/dL does not demonstrate cyanosis until 5 g/dL of that hemoglobin becomes unoxygenated, reducing the effective circulating hemoglobin to two thirds of the normal level.</p>

The proximal nail fold, when palpated, feels spongy or floating. Among the many causes are chronic hypoxia and lung cancer.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">A patient with anemia rarely manifests cyanosis, and a patient with polycythemia may appear cyanotic even if adequately oxygenated. Therefore, cyanosis is <em>not</em> a reliable sign of hypoxia.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of cyanosis is affected by room lighting, the patient&#x2019;s skin color, and the distance of the blood vessels from the surface of the skin. In the presence of a pulmonary condition, central cyanosis is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips. This indicates a decrease in oxygen tension in the blood. Peripheral cyanosis results from decreased blood flow to the body&#x2019;s periphery (fingers, toes, or earlobes), as in vasoconstriction from exposure to cold, and does not necessarily indicate a central systemic problem.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Upper Respiratory Structures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For a routine examination of the upper airway, only a simple light source, such as a penlight, is necessary. A more thorough examination requires the use of a nasal speculum.</p>
<p class="h7">Nose and Sinuses <img class="m" src="images/wl.png" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bddd8de696ca" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Assessing the Nose and Sinuses</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse inspects the external nose for lesions, asymmetry, or inflammation and then asks the patient to tilt the head backward. Gently pushing the tip of the nose upward, the nurse examines the internal structures of the nose, inspecting the mucosa for color, swelling, exudate, or bleeding. The nasal mucosa is normally redder than the oral mucosa. It may appear swollen and hyperemic if the patient has a common cold; however, in allergic rhinitis, the mucosa appears pale and swollen.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, the nurse inspects the septum for deviation, perforation, or bleeding. Most people have a slight degree of septal deviation; such deviation usually causes no symptoms. However, actual displacement of the cartilage into either the right or left side of the nose may produce nasal obstruction.</p>
<p class="indent">While the head is still tilted back, the nurse inspects the inferior and middle turbinates. In chronic rhinitis, nasal polyps may develop between the inferior and middle turbinates; they are distinguished by their gray appearance. Unlike the turbinates, they are gelatinous and freely movable.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff17-8">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff17-8.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff17-8.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;17-8 &#x2022;</span> Technique for palpating the frontal sinuses at left and the maxillary sinuses at right.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Next, the nurse may palpate the frontal and maxillary sinuses for tenderness (<a href="#ff17-8">Fig.&#x00A0;17-8</a>). Using the thumbs, the nurse applies gentle pressure in an upward fashion at the supraorbital ridges (frontal sinuses) and in the cheek area adjacent to the nose (maxillary sinuses). Tenderness in either area suggests inflammation. The frontal and maxillary sinuses can be inspected by transillumination (passing a strong light through a bony area, such as the sinuses, to inspect the cavity; see <a href="#ff17-9">Fig.&#x00A0;17-9</a>). If the light fails to penetrate, the cavity likely contains fluid or pus.</p>
<p class="h7">Mouth and Pharynx <img class="m" src="images/wl.png" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bddd98043822" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Assessing the Mouth and Throat</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">After the nasal inspection, the nurse assesses the mouth and the pharynx, instructing the patient to open the mouth wide and take a deep breath. Usually, this flattens the posterior tongue and briefly allows a full view of the anterior and posterior pillars, tonsils, uvula, and posterior pharynx (see <a href="c39.xhtml">Chapter 39</a>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page477" title="477"></span><a href="c39.xhtml#ff39-2">Fig.&#x00A0;39-2</a>). The nurse inspects these structures for color, symmetry, and evidence of exudate, ulceration, or enlargement. If a tongue blade is needed to depress the tongue to visualize the pharynx, it is pressed firmly beyond the midpoint of the tongue to avoid a gagging response.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff17-9">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff17-9.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff17-9.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;17-9 &#x2022;</span> At left, the nurse positions the light source for transillumination of the frontal sinus. At right, the nurse shields the patient&#x2019;s brow and shines the light. In normal conditions (a darkened room), the light should shine through the tissues and appear as a reddish glow (above the nurse&#x2019;s hand) over the sinus.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Trachea</p>
<p class="nonindent">Next, the position and mobility of the trachea are noted by direct palpation. This is performed by placing the thumb and the index finger of one hand on either side of the trachea just above the sternal notch. The trachea is highly sensitive and palpating too firmly may trigger a coughing or gagging response. The trachea is normally in the midline as it enters the thoracic inlet behind the sternum; however, it may be deviated by masses in the neck or the mediastinum. Pulmonary disorders such as a pneumothorax or pleural effusion may also displace the trachea.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Lower Respiratory Structures and Breathing <img class="m" src="images/wl.png" alt=""/></h6>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5bddda62b5ca5" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Assessing the Posterior and Lateral Thorax</b></p>

<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the lower respiratory structures includes inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation of the thorax. The patient should be positioned as necessary prior to the assessment.</p>
<p class="h7">Positioning</p>
<p class="nonindent">To assess the posterior thorax and the lungs, the patient should be in a sitting position with arms crossed in front of the chest and hands placed on the opposite shoulders (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). This position separates the scapulae widely and exposes more lung area for assessment. If the patient is unable to sit, with the patient supine, the nurse should roll the patient from side to side to complete the posterior examination. To assess the anterior thorax and lungs, the patient should be either supine or sitting. The supine position allows easier displacement of the patient&#x2019;s breast tissue, improving the nurse&#x2019;s ability to perform the chest examination.</p>
<p class="h7">Thoracic Inspection</p>
<p class="nonindent">Inspection of the thorax provides information about the respiratory system, the musculoskeletal structure, and the patient&#x2019;s nutritional status. The nurse observes the skin over the thorax for color and turgor and for evidence of loss of subcutaneous tissue. It is important to note asymmetry, if present. In documenting or reporting the findings, anatomic landmarks are used as points of reference (<a href="#ct17-10">Chart&#x00A0;17-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Chest Configuration</p>
<p class="nonindent">Normally, the ratio of the anteroposterior diameter to the lateral diameter is 1:2. However, there are four main deformities of the chest associated with respiratory disease that alter this relationship: barrel chest, funnel chest (pectus excavatum), pigeon chest (pectus carinatum), and kyphoscoliosis.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Barrel Chest.</strong></span> Barrel chest occurs as a result of overinflation of the lungs, which increases the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax. It occurs with aging and is a hallmark sign of emphysema and COPD. In a patient with emphysema, the ribs are more widely spaced and the intercostal spaces tend to bulge on expiration. The appearance of the patient with advanced emphysema is thus quite characteristic, allowing the nurse to detect its presence easily, even from a distance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Funnel Chest (Pectus Excavatum).</strong></span> Funnel chest occurs when there is a depression in the lower portion of the sternum. This may compress the heart and great vessels, resulting in murmurs. Funnel chest may occur with rickets or Marfan syndrome.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Pigeon Chest (Pectus Carinatum).</strong></span> A pigeon chest occurs as a result of the anterior displacement of the sternum, which also increases the anteroposterior diameter. This may occur with rickets, Marfan syndrome, or severe kyphoscoliosis.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="H6"><strong>Kyphoscoliosis.</strong></span> Kyphoscoliosis is characterized by elevation of the scapula and a corresponding S-shaped spine. This deformity limits lung expansion within the thorax. It may occur with osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders that affect the thorax.</p>
<p class="h8">Breathing Patterns and Respiratory Rates</p>
<p class="nonindent">Observation of the rate, depth, and symmetry during respiration is a simple but important aspect of assessment. The normal adult who is at rest comfortably takes 12 to 20 breaths/min (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Except for the occasional sigh, respirations are quiet with a regular rate, depth, and rhythm. The normal pattern associated with breathing is known as eupnea. Certain pathologic conditions may alter the rate and rhythm and are characteristic of certain disease states. For example, wheezing is commonly seen in the patient with asthma. Changes found during the act of breathing may be the first clinical sign that the patient&#x2019;s condition is deteriorating (IHI, 2019). The rate and depth of various patterns of respiration are presented in <a href="#tt17-3">Table&#x00A0;17-3</a>.</p>
<p class="concept"><img class="mi" src="images/concept.jpg" alt=""/> Concept Mastery Alert</p>
<div class="conceptbox1">
<p class="concepttxt">There are subtle differences between Cheyne&#x2013;Stokes and Biot&#x2019;s respiration patterns. Between regularly cycled periods of apnea, Cheyne&#x2013;Stokes respirations demonstrate a regular pattern with the rate and depth of breathing increasing and then decreasing. In Biot&#x2019;s respiration, irregularly cycled periods of apnea are interspersed with cycles of normal rate and depth.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Temporary pauses of breathing, or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;apnea:&lt;/b&gt; temporary cessation of breathing">apnea</button></strong>, may be noted. When episodes of apnea occur repeatedly during sleep, secondary to transient upper airway blockage, the condition is called <strong>obstructive sleep apnea.</strong> In thin people, it is quite normal to note a slight retraction of the intercostal spaces during quiet breathing. Bulging of the intercostal spaces during expiration implies obstruction of expiratory airflow, as in emphysema. Marked retraction on inspiration, particularly if asymmetric, implies blockage of a branch of the respiratory tree. Asymmetric bulging of the intercostal spaces, on either side of the thorax, is created by an increase in pressure within the hemithorax. This may be a result of air trapped under pressure within the pleural cavity, where it is not normally present (pneumothorax), or the pressure of fluid within the pleural space (pleural effusion).</p>
<p class="h8">Use of Accessory Muscles</p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to breathing patterns and respiratory rates, the nurse should observe for the use of accessory muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and trapezius muscles during inspiration, and the abdominal and internal intercostal muscles during expiration. These muscles provide additional support to assist the breathing effort during times of exertion as seen in exercise or certain disease states (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Locating Thoracic Landmarks</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">With respect to the thorax, location is defined both horizontally and vertically. With respect to the lungs, location is defined by lobe.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Horizontal Reference Points</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Horizontally, thoracic locations are identified according to their proximity to the rib or the intercostal space under the examiner&#x2019;s fingers. On the anterior surface, identification of a specific rib is facilitated by first locating the angle of Louis. This is where the manubrium joins the body of the sternum in the midline. The second rib joins the sternum at this prominent landmark.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Other ribs may be identified by counting down from the second rib. The intercostal spaces are referred to in terms of the rib immediately above the intercostal space; for example, the fifth intercostal space is directly below the fifth rib.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Locating ribs on the posterior surface of the thorax is more difficult. The first step is to identify the spinous process. This is accomplished by finding the seventh cervical vertebra (<em>vertebra prominens</em>), which is the most prominent spinous process. When the neck is slightly flexed, the seventh cervical spinous process stands out. Other vertebrae are then identified by counting downward.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Vertical Reference Points</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Several imaginary lines are used as vertical referents or landmarks to identify the location of thoracic findings. The <em>midsternal line</em> passes through the center of the sternum. The <em>midclavicular line</em> is an imaginary line that descends from the middle of the clavicle. The <em>point of maximal impulse</em> of the heart normally lies along this line on the left thorax.</p>
<div class="figure">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/478-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-478-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a></figcaption></figure></div>

<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">When the arm is abducted from the body at 90 degrees, imaginary vertical lines may be drawn from the anterior axillary fold, from the middle of the axilla, and from the posterior axillary fold. These lines are called, respectively, the <em>anterior axillary line,</em> the <em>midaxillary line,</em> and the <em>posterior axillary line.</em> A line drawn vertically through the superior and inferior poles of the scapula is called the <em>scapular line,</em> and a line drawn down the center of the vertebral column is called the <em>vertebral line.</em> Using these landmarks, for example, the examiner communicates findings by referring to an area of dullness extending from the vertebral to the scapular line between the 7th and 10th ribs on the right.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Lobes of the Lungs</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The lobes of the lung may be mapped on the surface of the chest wall in the following manner. The line between the upper and lower lobes on the left begins at the fourth thoracic spinous process posteriorly, proceeds around to cross the fifth rib in the midaxillary line, and meets the sixth rib at the sternum. This line on the right divides the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe. The line dividing the right upper lobe from the middle lobe is an incomplete one that begins at the fifth rib in the midaxillary line, where it intersects the line between the upper and lower lobes and traverses horizontally to the sternum. Thus, the upper lobes are dominant on the anterior surface of the thorax, and the lower lobes are dominant on the posterior surface. There is no presentation of the right middle lobe on the posterior surface of the chest.</p>

<p class="h7">Thoracic Palpation</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse palpates the thorax for tenderness, masses, lesions, respiratory excursion, and vocal fremitus. If the patient has reported an area of pain or if lesions are apparent, the nurse performs direct palpation with the fingertips (for skin lesions and subcutaneous masses) or with the ball of the hand (for deeper masses or generalized flank or rib discomfort).</p>
<p class="h8">Respiratory Excursion</p>
<p class="nonindent">Respiratory excursion is an estimation of thoracic expansion and may disclose significant information about thoracic movement during breathing. The nurse assesses the patient for range and symmetry of excursion. For anterior assessment, the nurse places the thumbs along the costal margin of the chest wall and instructs the patient to inhale deeply. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page480" title="480"></span>The nurse observes movement of the thumbs during inspiration and expiration. This movement is normally symmetric (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Posterior assessment is performed by placing the thumbs adjacent to the spinal column at the level of the 10th rib (<a href="#ff17-10">Fig.&#x00A0;17-10</a>). The hands lightly grasp the lateral rib cage. Sliding the thumbs medially about 2.5 cm (1 inch) raises a small skin fold between the thumbs. The patient is instructed to take a full inspiration and to exhale fully. The nurse observes for normal flattening of the skin fold and feels the symmetric movement of the thorax.</p>

<p class="indent">Decreased chest excursion may be caused by chronic fibrotic disease. Asymmetric excursion may be due to splinting secondary to pleurisy, fractured ribs, trauma, or unilateral bronchial obstruction.</p>
<p class="h8">Tactile Fremitus</p>
<p class="nonindent">Tactile <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;fremitus:&lt;/b&gt; vibrations of speech felt as tremors of the chest wall during palpation">fremitus</button></strong> describes vibrations of the chest wall that result from speech detected on palpation. Normally, sounds generated by the larynx travel distally along the bronchial tree to set the chest wall in resonant motion. This is most pronounced with consonant sounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Normal fremitus varies on the basis of numerous factors. It is influenced by the thickness of the chest wall, especially muscle, and the subcutaneous tissue associated with obesity. It is also influenced by pitch; lower-pitched sounds travel better through the normal lung and produce greater vibration of the chest wall. Therefore, fremitus is more pronounced in men than in women because of the deeper male voice. Normally, fremitus is most pronounced where the large bronchi are closest to the chest wall, is more prominent on the right side, and is decreased or absent over the anterior chest wall which overlies the heart and great vessels (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is asked to repeat &#x201C;ninety-nine&#x201D; or &#x201C;one, one, one&#x201D; as the nurse&#x2019;s hands move down the patient&#x2019;s thorax (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). The vibrations are detected with the palmar surfaces of the hands, or the ulnar aspect of the extended hands, on the thorax. The hand or hands are moved in sequence down the thorax. Corresponding areas of the thorax are compared (<a href="#ff17-11">Fig.&#x00A0;17-11</a>). Bony areas are not assessed.</p>

<p class="indent">Air does not conduct sound well; however, a solid substance such as tissue does, provided that it has elasticity and is not compressed. Therefore, an increase in solid tissue per unit volume of lung enhances fremitus, and an increase in air per unit volume of lung impedes sound. Patients with emphysema exhibit almost no tactile fremitus. A patient with consolidation of a lobe of the lung from pneumonia has increased tactile fremitus over that lobe.</p>
<p class="h7">Thoracic Percussion</p>
<p class="nonindent">Percussion produces audible and tactile vibration and allows the nurse to determine whether underlying tissues are filled with air, fluid, or solid material. Healthy lung tissue is resonant. Dullness over the lung occurs when air-filled lung tissue is replaced by fluid or solid tissue. <a href="#tt17-4">Table&#x00A0;17-4</a> reviews percussion sounds and their characteristics. Percussion is also used to estimate the size and location of certain structures within the thorax (e.g., diaphragm, heart, liver).</p>
<p class="indent">Percussion usually begins with the posterior thorax. The nurse percusses across each shoulder top, locating the 5-cm width of resonance overlying the lung apices (<a href="#ff17-12">Fig.&#x00A0;17-12</a>). Then the nurse proceeds down the posterior thorax, percussing symmetric areas at intervals of 5 to 6 cm (2 to 2.5 inches). To perform percussion, the middle finger of the nondominant hand is firmly placed against the area of the chest wall to be percussed. The distal interphalangeal joint of this finger is struck with the tip of the middle finger of the dominant hand. This finger is partially flexed, and percussion occurs in a smooth, dartlike fashion. Bony structures (scapulae or ribs) are not percussed.</p>
<p class="indent">To perform percussion over the anterior chest, the nurse begins in the supraclavicular area and proceeds downward, from one intercostal space to the next. Dullness noted to the left of the sternum between the third and fifth intercostal spaces is a normal finding, because that is the location of the heart. Similarly, there is a normal span of liver dullness below the lung at the right costal margin (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="h8">Diaphragmatic Excursion</p>
<p class="nonindent">The normal resonance of the lung stops at the diaphragm. The position of the diaphragm is different during inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p class="indent">To assess the position and motion of the diaphragm, the nurse instructs the patient to take a deep breath and hold it while the maximal descent of the diaphragm is percussed. The point at which the percussion note at the midscapular line changes from resonance to dullness is marked with a pen. The patient is then instructed to exhale fully and hold it while the nurse again percusses downward to the dullness of the diaphragm. This point is also marked. The distance between the two markings indicates the range of motion of the diaphragm.</p>
<p class="indent">Maximal excursion of the diaphragm may be as much as 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) in healthy, tall young men, but for most people, it is usually 5 to 7 cm (2 to 2.75 inches). Normally, the diaphragm is about 2 cm (0.75 inch) higher on the right because of the location of the liver. Decreased diaphragmatic excursion may occur with pleural effusion. Atelectasis, diaphragmatic paralysis, or pregnancy may account for a diaphragm that is positioned high in the thorax (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1344">Hogan-Quigley et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="h7">Thoracic Auscultation</p>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment concludes with auscultation of the anterior, posterior, and lateral thorax. Auscultation helps the nurse assess the flow of air through the bronchial tree and evaluate the presence of fluid or solid obstruction in the lung. The nurse auscultates for normal breath sounds, adventitious sounds, and voice sounds.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse places the diaphragm of the stethoscope firmly against the bare skin of the chest wall as the patient breathes slowly and deeply through the mouth. Corresponding areas of the chest are auscultated in a systematic fashion from the apices to the bases and along midaxillary lines. The sequence of auscultation is similar to that used for percussion. The nurse may need to listen to two full inspirations and expirations at each anatomic location for valid interpretation of the sound heard. Repeated deep breaths may result in symptoms of hyperventilation (e.g., lightheadedness); this is avoided by having the patient rest and breathe normally periodically during the examination.</p>
<p class="h8"><strong>Breath Sounds</strong> <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be86b855ef9f" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Change in Breathing Sounds</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Normal breath sounds are distinguished by their location over a specific area of the lung and are identified as vesicular, bronchovesicular, and bronchial (tubular) breath sounds (<a href="#tt17-5">Table&#x00A0;17-5</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The location, quality, and intensity of breath sounds are determined during auscultation. When airflow is decreased by bronchial obstruction (atelectasis) or when fluid (pleural effusion) or tissue (obesity) separates the air passages from the stethoscope, breath sounds are diminished or absent. For example, the breath sounds of the patient with emphysema are faint or often completely inaudible. When they are heard, the expiratory phase is prolonged. In the patient with obesity, breath sounds may be inaudible. Bronchial and bronchovesicular sounds that are audible anywhere except over the main bronchus in the lungs signify pathology, usually indicating consolidation in the lung (e.g., pneumonia, heart failure). This finding requires further evaluation.</p>
<p class="h8">Adventitious Sounds</p>
<p class="nonindent">An abnormal condition that affects the bronchial tree and alveoli may produce adventitious (additional) sounds. Some adventitious sounds are divided into two categories: <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;crackles:&lt;/b&gt; nonmusical, discontinuous popping sounds during inspiration caused by delayed reopening of the airways heard on chest auscultation">crackles</button></strong>, or nonmusical, discontinuous sounds; and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;wheezes:&lt;/b&gt; continuous musical sounds associated with airway narrowing or partial obstruction">wheezes</button></strong>, or continuous musical sounds (<a href="#tt17-6">Table&#x00A0;17-6</a>). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;rhonchi:&lt;/b&gt; deep, low-pitched snoring sound associated with partial airway obstruction, heard on chest auscultation">Rhonchi</button></strong>, a type of wheezing, are lower-pitched continuous sounds heard over the lungs in partial airway obstruction. Depending on their location and severity, wheezes and rhonchi may be heard with or without a stethoscope. The duration of the sound is the important distinction to make in identifying the sound as discontinuous or continuous. Friction rubs may be either discontinuous or continuous. Stridor is a continuous, high-pitched musical sound which is heard over the neck. This sound is caused by an interruption of airflow and indicates a narrowing of the upper respiratory tract. Stridor warrants emergent attention.</p>
<p class="h8">Voice Sounds</p>
<p class="nonindent">The sound heard through the stethoscope as the patient speaks is known as vocal resonance. The nurse should assess voice sounds when abnormal breath sounds are auscultated. The vibrations produced in the larynx are transmitted to the chest wall as they pass through the bronchi and alveolar tissue. Voice sounds are evaluated by having the patient repeat &#x201C;ninety-nine&#x201D; or &#x201C;eee&#x201D; while the nurse listens with the stethoscope in corresponding areas of the chest from the apices to the bases. With normal physiology, the sounds are faint and indistinct. Pathology that increases lung density, such as pneumonia and pulmonary edema, alters this normal physiologic response and may result in the following sounds:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;bronchophony:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal increase in clarity of transmitted voice sounds heard when auscultating the lungs">Bronchophony</button></strong> describes vocal resonance that is more intense and clearer than normal.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;egophony:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal change in tone of voice that is heard when auscultating the lungs">Egophony</button></strong> describes voice sounds that are distorted. It is best appreciated by having the patient repeat the letter E. The distortion produced by consolidation transforms the sound into a clearly heard A rather than E.</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="s528"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Assessment of Respiratory Function in the Patient Who Is Acutely or Critically Ill</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of respiratory status is essential for the well-being of the patient who is acutely or critically ill. Often, such a patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The nurse analyzes findings from the health history and assessment while considering laboratory and diagnostic test results. After checking the ventilator settings to make sure that they are set as prescribed and that alarms are always in the &#x201C;on&#x201D; position, the nurse must assess for patient&#x2013;ventilator synchrony and for agitation, restlessness, and other signs of respiratory distress (nasal flaring, excessive use of intercostals and accessory muscles, uncoordinated movement of the chest and abdomen, and a report by the patient of shortness of breath). The nurse must note changes in the patient&#x2019;s vital signs and evidence of hemodynamic instability and report them to the primary provider, because they may indicate that the mechanical ventilation is ineffective or that the patient&#x2019;s status has deteriorated. It is important for the nurse to position the patient to promote adequate oxygenation and ventilation and to prevent potential complications. For example, the patient may need to be positioned with the head of bed elevated to prevent aspiration, especially if the patient is receiving enteral feedings. Alternatively, in patients with ARDS who are experiencing refractory hypoxemia, prone positioning is recommended (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>). In addition, the patient&#x2019;s mental status should be assessed and compared to previous status. Lethargy and somnolence may be signs of increasing carbon dioxide levels and should not be considered insignificant, even if the patient is receiving sedation or analgesic agents.</p>
<p class="indent">Chest auscultation, percussion, and palpation are essential and routine parts of the evaluation of the patient who is critically ill, with or without mechanical ventilation. A recumbent patient must be turned to assess all lung fields. Dependent areas must be assessed for normal breath sounds and adventitious sounds. Failure to examine the dependent areas of the lungs can result in missing the findings associated with disorders such as atelectasis or pleural effusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Tests of the patient&#x2019;s respiratory status are easily performed at the bedside by measuring the respiratory rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>), tidal volume, minute ventilation, vital capacity, inspiratory force, and compliance. These tests are particularly important for patients who are at risk for pulmonary complications, including those who have undergone chest or abdominal surgery, have had prolonged anesthesia, or have preexisting pulmonary disease, and those who are older or have obesity. These tests are also used routinely for patients who are mechanically ventilated. Although some of these tests are performed by respiratory therapists, it is useful for nurses to understand the significance of these test results.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient whose chest expansion is limited by external restrictions such as obesity or abdominal distention, or who cannot breathe deeply because of postoperative pain, sedation, or drug overdose will inhale and exhale a low volume of air (referred to as low tidal volumes). Prolonged hypoventilation at low tidal volumes can produce alveolar collapse (atelectasis). Consequently, when the forced residual capacity decreases, compliance is reduced, and the patient must breathe faster to maintain the same degree of tissue oxygenation. These events can be exaggerated in patients who have preexisting pulmonary diseases; in older adult patients whose airways are less compliant because the small airways may collapse during expiration; or in patients with obesity or who have relatively low tidal volumes even when healthy. (More details of the assessment of the patient with various lung disorders are described in subsequent chapters in this unit.)</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The nurse should not rely only on visual inspection of the rate and depth of a patient&#x2019;s respiratory excursions to determine the adequacy of ventilation. Respiratory excursions may appear normal or exaggerated due to an increased work of breathing, but the patient may actually be moving only enough air to ventilate the dead space. If there is any question regarding adequacy of ventilation, the nurse should use auscultation or pulse oximetry (or both) for additional assessment of respiratory status.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Tidal Volume</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The volume of each breath is referred to as the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;tidal volume:&lt;/b&gt; volume of air inspired and expired with each breath during normal breathing">tidal volume</button></strong> (see <a href="c17-sec01.xhtml#tt17-1">Table&#x00A0;17-1</a> to review lung capacities and volumes). A spirometer is an instrument that can be used at the bedside to measure volumes. If the patient is breathing through an endotracheal (ET) tube or tracheostomy, the spirometer is directly attached to it and the exhaled volume is obtained from the reading on the gauge. In other patients, the spirometer is attached to a facemask or a mouthpiece positioned so that it is airtight, and the exhaled volume is measured.</p>
<p class="indent">The tidal volume may vary from breath to breath. To ensure that the measurement is reliable, it is important to measure the volumes of several breaths and to note the range of tidal volumes, together with the average tidal volume.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Minute Ventilation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because respiratory rates and tidal volumes vary widely from breath to breath, these data alone are unreliable indicators of adequate ventilation. However, the tidal volume multiplied by the respiratory rate provides what is called <em>minute ventilation</em> or <em>minute volume,</em> the volume of air exchanged per minute. This value is useful in detecting respiratory failure. In practice, the minute volume is not calculated but is measured directly using a spirometer. In a patient receiving mechanical ventilation, minute volume is often monitored by the ventilator and can be viewed on the monitoring screen.</p>
<p class="indent">Minute ventilation may be decreased by a variety of conditions that result in hypoventilation. When the minute ventilation falls, alveolar ventilation in the lungs also decreases and the PaCO<sub>2</sub> increases.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vital Capacity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Vital capacity is measured by having the patient take in a maximal breath and exhale fully through a spirometer. The normal value depends on the patient&#x2019;s age, gender, body build, and weight.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Most patients can generate a vital capacity twice the volume they normally breathe in and out (tidal volume). If the vital capacity is less than 10 mL/kg, the patient will be unable to sustain spontaneous ventilation and will require respiratory assistance.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">When the vital capacity is exhaled at a maximal flow rate, the forced vital capacity (FVC) is measured. Most patients can exhale at least 80% of their vital capacity in 1 second (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or FEV<sub>1</sub>) and almost all of it in 3 seconds (FEV<sub>3</sub>). A reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page486" title="486"></span>suggests abnormal pulmonary airflow. If the patient&#x2019;s FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC are proportionately reduced, maximal lung expansion is restricted in some way. If the reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> greatly exceeds the reduction in FVC (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC less than 85%), the patient may have some degree of airway obstruction.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Inspiratory Force</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Inspiratory force evaluates the effort the patient is making during inspiration. It does not require patient cooperation and, therefore, is a useful measurement in the patient who is unconscious. The equipment needed for this measurement includes a manometer that measures negative pressure and adapters that are connected to an anesthesia mask or a cuffed ET tube. The manometer is attached, and the airway is completely occluded for 10 to 20 seconds while the inspiratory efforts of the patient are registered on the manometer. The normal inspiratory pressure is about 100 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. If the negative pressure registered after 15 seconds of occluding the airway is less than about 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, mechanical ventilation is usually required because the patient lacks sufficient muscle strength for deep breathing or effective coughing.</p>
