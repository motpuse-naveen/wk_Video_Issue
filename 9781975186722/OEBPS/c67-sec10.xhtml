<p class="nonindent">The growing rate of obesity in the United States has implications for treating patients with obesity within the ED, in terms of stocking appropriately sized equipment, gowns, and stretchers; ensuring that equipment (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scanners) is able to handle a greater weight capacity; and recognizing specific disorders and complications that may occur in these patients. For instance, research suggests that increased mortality is associated with the degree of obesity (ENA, 2020a). Other considerations in ED management of patients with obesity include an understanding that it is generally more challenging to insert IV lines and airways. Ventilation also can be a challenge from the increased weight of the chest wall and the increased incidence of hypoventilation and sleep apnea among patients with obesity. Special consideration must be taken with lipophilic medications, as they take longer to clear from the larger volume of adipose tissue. Weight-based medications must be calculated carefully using ideal body mass. X-rays may be difficult to visualize because of poor penetration (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Richardson &#x0026; Harris, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Complications that patients with obesity are more prone to experience during hospitalization include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and pressure injuries. Patients with severe obesity who have femur fractures have a significantly higher risk of death, as well as a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis than patients of normal weight (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Richardson &#x0026; Harris, 2018</a>). Although many of these complications do not occur until later in the hospital stay, some preventive measures (e.g., encouraging turning, coughing, and deep-breathing exercises to prevent atelectasis) may be initiated in the ED. Functional recovery time is extended in patients with obesity, resulting in longer lengths of stay and increased hospital costs. Initiating prevention measures in the ED, such as early backboard removal and providing early preventive respiratory care, are targeted to improve recovery time (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Richardson &#x0026; Harris, 2018</a>). Arranging transfers of patients with obesity must also take into consideration the availability of appropriately sized equipment.</p>
