<h4 class="h4" id="s1700">Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</strong> is a chronic functional disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with disordered bowel movements, which may include diarrhea, constipation, or both, without an identifiable cause (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lehrer, 2019</a>; NIDDK, 2017c; Pacheco, Roizenblatt, G&#x00F3;is, et al., 2019). Global prevalence is estimated at 11%; its prevalence among American adults is estimated to be 12%. It is typically diagnosed in adults younger than 45 years of age (NIDDK, 2017c). Women are affected more often than men, with twice as many women diagnosed with IBS in the United States than men. A complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors is thought to be associated with the onset of IBS. It is believed that some triggers can either herald the initial onset of IBS or exacerbate symptoms in those with diagnosed IBS; these may include chronic stress, sleep deprivation, neurohormonal deregulation, bacterial overgrowth, genetics, surgery, infections (e.g. <em>Giardia</em>), inflammation, and food intolerance (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Pacheco et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1701">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">IBS results from a functional disorder of intestinal motility. The change in motility may be related to neuroendocrine dysregulation, especially changes in serotonin signaling, infection, irritation, or a vascular or metabolic disturbance. The peristaltic waves are affected at specific segments of the intestine and in the intensity with which they propel the fecal matter forward. There is no evidence of inflammation or tissue changes in the intestinal mucosa (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1702">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms can vary widely, ranging in intensity and duration from mild and infrequent to severe and continuous. The main symptom is an alteration in bowel patterns: constipation (classified as IBS-C), diarrhea (classified as IBS-D), or a combination of both (classified as IBS-M for &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;). The few patients with IBS who do not fit any of these three categories of IBS-C, IBS-D, or IBS-M, are classified as IBS-U for &#x201C;unclassified.&#x201D; Pain, bloating, and abdominal distention often accompany changes in bowel pattern. The abdominal pain is sometimes precipitated by eating and is frequently relieved by defecation. IBS frequently occurs concomitant with other GI disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and with a variety of non-GI functional disorders, including chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, fibromyalgia, interstitial cystitis, migraine headaches, anxiety, and depression (NIDDK, 2017c).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1703">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The Rome IV criteria define IBS as recurrent abdominal pain occurring at least once daily during the last 3 months, associated with two or more of the following (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lehrer, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Abdominal pain related to defecation;</span></li>
<li><span>Abdominal pain associated with a change in frequency of stool;</span></li>
<li><span>Abdominal pain associated with a change in form/appearance of stool.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Recording the quality and quantity of bowel movements in a stool diary such as the Bristol Stool Form Scale can be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1294" title="1294"></span>useful in determining the category of IBS (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lacy et al., 2016</a>) (see <a href="#ff41-2">Fig. 41-2</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">A definite diagnosis of IBS also necessitates testing to confirm the absence of structural or other disorders. Results from a CBC and C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin can rule out IBD (see later discussion) for patients who may have IBS-D or IBS-M, as well as serologic tests for celiac disease (see later discussion). Stool studies and colonoscopy may be performed to rule out other colon diseases (e.g., colorectal cancer, colitis) (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lacy et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1704">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of treatment are to relieve abdominal pain and control diarrhea or constipation. Lifestyle modification, including stress reduction, ensuring adequate sleep, and instituting an exercise regimen, can result in symptom improvement. The introduction of soluble fiber (e.g., psyllium) to the diet is important to IBS management. Restriction and then gradual reintroduction of foods that are possibly irritating may help determine what types of food are acting as irritants. Low-FODMAP diets, which restrict intake of the following types of foods, might improve symptoms for some patients (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Pacheco et al., 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><strong><em>F</em></strong>ermentable <strong><em>O</em></strong>ligosaccharides (e.g., wheat, rye, asparagus, legumes, garlic, onions),</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>D</em></strong>isaccharides (lactose-containing foods such as milk, yogurt),</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>M</em></strong>onosaccharides (fructose-containing foods such as honey, agave nectar, figs, mangoes), <strong><em>A</em></strong>nd</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>P</em></strong>olyols (e.g., blackberries, lychee, and low-calorie sweeteners)</span></li></ul>

<p class="indent">For patients with IBS-D, antidiarrheal agents (e.g., loperamide) may be given to control the diarrhea and fecal urgency. Women with severe IBS-D that persists for more than 6 months that does not respond to other therapies may be prescribed alosetron, a highly selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist that slows colonic motility. Other drugs that can mitigate IBS-D symptoms include rifaximin, a nonabsorbable oral antibiotic, and eluxadoline, a mu-receptor agonist/delta-receptor antagonist that neuromodulates colonic motility (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Pacheco et al., 2019</a>). Lubiprostone, a chloride channel regulator in the gut, can be prescribed for patients with IBS-C (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lacy et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with all types of IBS complain of abdominal pain. This symptom may be mitigated by prescribing smooth muscle antispasmodic agents (e.g., dicyclomine). Antidepressants can assist in treating underlying anxiety and depression but also have secondary benefits. Antidepressants may affect serotonin levels, thus modulating intestinal transit time and improving abdominal comfort. Peppermint oil, a complementary medication, has proven effective in diminishing abdominal discomfort (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lacy et al., 2016</a>). Other alternatives for IBS management include probiotics. Probiotics are bacteria that include <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em> that can be given to help decrease abdominal bloating and gas (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Lacy et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1705">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse&#x2019;s role is to provide patient and family education and encourage self-care activities. The nurse may provide education on the appropriate use of a bowel habit diary, such as the Bristol Stool Form Scale (see <a href="#ff41-2">Fig. 41-2A</a>). The nurse emphasizes and reinforces good sleep habits and good dietary habits (e.g., avoidance of food triggers). A good way to identify problem foods is to keep a 1- to 2-week food diary and correlate symptoms with food intake. Patients are encouraged to eat at regular times and to avoid food triggers. They should understand that although adequate fluid intake is necessary, fluid should not be taken with meals because this results in abdominal distention. Alcohol use and cigarette smoking are discouraged. Stress management via relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy, yoga, and exercise can be recommended.</p>
<p class="SPH1" id="sec13"><strong>DISORDERS OF MALABSORPTION</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The inability of the digestive system to absorb one or more of the major vitamins (especially A and B<sub>12</sub>), minerals (i.e., iron and calcium), and nutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) occurs in disorders of malabsorption. Interruptions in the complex digestive process may occur anywhere in the digestive system and cause decreased absorption (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>). The conditions that cause malabsorption can be grouped into the following categories (<a href="c41-sec17.xhtml#bib3143">Norris, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Mucosal (transport) disorders causing generalized malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, Crohn&#x2019;s disease, radiation enteritis)</span></li>
<li><span>Luminal disorders causing malabsorption (e.g., bile acid deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, or chronic pancreatitis)</span></li>
<li><span>Lymphatic obstruction, interfering with transport of fat by products of digestion into the systemic circulation (e.g., neoplasms, surgical trauma).</span></li></ul>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Managing Lactose Intolerance</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that deficiency of lactase, a digestive enzyme essential for the digestion and absorption of lactose (&#x201C;milk sugar&#x201D;) from the intestines, results in an intolerance to milk.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Prevent symptoms by eliminating milk and milk substances.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eliminate processed foods that have fillers, such as dried milk, added to them; recognizing this can help determine which foods may need to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Reduce symptoms by pretreating foods with lactase preparations (e.g., Lactaid drops) before ingestion or by ingesting lactase enzyme tablets with the first bite of food.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Understand that most people can tolerate 1 to 2 cups of milk or milk products daily without major problems; they are best tolerated if ingested in small amounts during the day.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that lactase activity of yogurt with &#x201C;active cultures&#x201D; helps the digestion of lactose within the intestine better than lactase preparations.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Recognize that milk and milk products are rich sources of calcium and vitamin D; elimination of milk from the diet may result in calcium and vitamin D deficiencies; decreased intake without supplements can lead to osteoporosis.</p>
