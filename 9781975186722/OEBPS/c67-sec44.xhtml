<p class="nonindent">In the United States, about 1 in 4 women and nearly 1 in 10 men have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime. Over 43 million women and 38 million men have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner (CDC, 2019c). IPV may include physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, psychological aggression, neglect, financial abuse, or intimidation by a former or intimate partner (ENA, 2018b). It is important to recognize that IPV does occur in all cultures and populations; these may include teenagers, older adults, and heterosexual, transgender, and same sex couples (ENA, 2018b).</p>
<p class="indent">Those who have been subjected to IPV have significantly higher rates of visits to the ED than the general population. Because patients subjected to IPV often have contact first with nurses in the health care system, ED nurses must be vigilant in their assessments of both women and men who present with injuries that may be consistent with IPV (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4655">Herzog, Maina, &#x0026; Maposa, 2019</a>). In addition, ED nurses must be aware that men and women with disability are at higher risk of domestic violence and abuse than people without disability and should include questions that screen for IPV in their evaluations (see <a href="c50.xhtml">Chapter 50</a>, <a href="c50-sec03.xhtml#ct50-3">Chart 50-3</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3260"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtl1.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is estimated that more than 1 in 10 adults 70 years or older (14%) have been abused or neglected, a type of IPV called <em>elder abuse</em> (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Rosay &#x0026; Mulford, 2017</a>). The majority of elder abuse is perpetrated by family members (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4660">National Center on Elder Abuse, 2017</a>). Elder abuse takes many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, and verbal abuse; neglect; violation of personal rights; abandonment; and financial abuse (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3261">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When people who have been abused seek treatment, they may present with physical injuries or health problems such as anxiety, insomnia, or GI symptoms related to stress. The possibility of IPV should be investigated whenever a person presents with multiple injuries that are in various stages of healing, when injuries are unexplained, and when the explanation does not fit the physical picture (see <a href="#ct67-8">Chart 67-8</a>). The possibility of neglect should be investigated whenever a person who is dependent shows evidence of inattention to hygiene, to nutrition, or to know medical needs (e.g., unfilled medication prescriptions, missed appointments with health care providers). In the ED, the most common physical injuries seen are unexplained bruises, lacerations, abrasions, head injuries, or fractures. The most common clinical manifestations of neglect are malnutrition and dehydration (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3262">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses in EDs are in an ideal position to provide early detection and interventions for victims of IPV. This requires an acute awareness of the signs of possible IPV, including abuse, maltreatment, and neglect. Nurses must be skilled in interviewing techniques that are likely to elicit accurate information. A careful history is crucial in the screening process. Asking questions in private&#x2014;away from others&#x2014;may be helpful in eliciting information about abuse, maltreatment, and neglect. Nurses need to be aware that women may withhold directly answering questions regarding IPV in fear of retaliation, loss of children, and retribution against the children (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4655">Herzog et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Assessing for Abuse, Maltreatment, and Neglect</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following questions may be helpful when assessing a patient for abuse, maltreatment, and neglect:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>I noticed that you have a number of bruises. Can you tell me how they happened? Has anyone hurt you?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>You seem frightened. Has anyone ever hurt you?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Patients sometimes tell me that they have been hurt by someone at home or at work. Could this be happening to you?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Are you afraid of anyone at home or work, or of anyone with whom you come in contact?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has anyone failed to help you to take care of yourself when you needed help?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has anyone prevented you from seeing friends or other people whom you wish to see?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Have you signed any papers that you did not understand or did not wish to sign?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has anyone forced you to sign papers against your will?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has anyone forced you to engage in sexual activities within the past year?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has anyone prevented you from using an assistive device (e.g., wheelchair, walker) within the past year?</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Has anyone you depend on refused to help you take your medicine, bathe, groom, or eat within the past year?</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Whenever evidence leads the nurse to suspect abuse or neglect, an evaluation with careful documentation of descriptions of events and drawings or photographs of injuries is important, because the medical record may be used as part of a legal proceeding. Assessment of the patient&#x2019;s general appearance and interactions with significant others, an examination of the entire surface area of the body, and a mental status examination are crucial.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3263">Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The aims of IPV screening include earlier identification of patients who have been abused and prevention of continued abusive events, including homicide (ENA, 2018b). Whenever abuse, maltreatment, or neglect is suspected, the health care provider&#x2019;s main concern should be the safety and welfare of the patient. Treatment focuses on the consequences of the abuse, violence, or neglect and on prevention of further injury. Protocols of most EDs require that a multidisciplinary approach be used. Nurses, physicians, social workers, and community agencies work collaboratively to develop and implement a plan for meeting the patient&#x2019;s needs.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient is in immediate danger, they should be separated from the person who is abusive or neglectful whenever possible. Referral to a shelter may be the most appropriate action, but many shelters are inaccessible to people with mobility limitations.</p>

<p class="indent">When abuse or neglect is the result of stress experienced by a caregiver who is no longer able to cope with the burden of caring for an older adult or a person with chronic disease or a disability, respite services may be necessary. Support groups may be helpful to these caregivers. When mental illness of the person who is abusive or neglectful is responsible for the situation, alternative living arrangements may be required.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses must be mindful that competent adults are free to accept or refuse the help that is offered to them. Some patients insist on remaining in the home environment where the abuse or neglect is occurring. The wishes of patients who are competent and not cognitively impaired should be respected. However, all possible alternatives, available resources, and safety plans should be explored with the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Mandatory reporting laws in most states require health care workers to report suspected abuse of children or older adults to an official agency, usually Child or Adult Protective Services. All that is required for reporting is the suspicion of abuse; the health care worker is not required to prove abuse or neglect. Likewise, health care workers who report suspected abuse are immune from civil or criminal liability if the report is made in good faith. Subsequent home visits resulting from the report of suspected abuse are a part of gathering information about the patient in the home environment. In addition, many states have resource hotlines for use by health care workers and by patients who seek answers to questions about abuse and neglect (ENA, 2020a).</p>
