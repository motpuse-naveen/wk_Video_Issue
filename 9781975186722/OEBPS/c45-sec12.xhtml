<h4 class="h4" id="s1957">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment measures in addition to palpation and auscultation include thyroid function tests, such as laboratory measurement of thyroid hormones, thyroid scanning, biopsy, and ultrasonography. The most widely used tests are serum immunoassay for TSH and free T<sub>4</sub>. Free T<sub>4</sub> levels correlate with metabolic status; they are elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Ultrasound, CT, and MRI may be used to clarify or confirm the results of other diagnostic studies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1958">Thyroid Tests</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Measurement of the serum TSH concentration is the primary screening test of thyroid function. The ability to detect minute changes in serum TSH makes it possible to distinguish subclinical thyroid disease from euthyroid states in patients with low or high normal values. Measurement of TSH is also used for monitoring thyroid hormone replacement therapy and for differentiating between disorders of the thyroid gland itself and disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Thyroid Association recommends that pregnant women be screened for thyroid disease (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3409">Alexander, Pearce, Brent, et al., 2017</a>); however, there is lack of consensus among professional organizations regarding routine screening of adults for thyroid disease. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend routine screening of adults (USPSTF, 2019).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Serum Free T<sub>4</sub></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Serum free T<sub>4</sub> is a direct measurement of free (unbound) thyroxine, the only metabolically active fraction of T<sub>4</sub>. The range of free T<sub>4</sub> in serum is normally 0.7 to 2.0 ng/dL (10 to 26 pmol/L) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). When measured by the dialysis method, free T<sub>4</sub> is not affected by variations in protein binding and is the procedure of choice for monitoring the changes in T<sub>4</sub> secretion during treatment for hyperthyroidism.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Serum T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Measurement of total T<sub>3</sub> or T<sub>4</sub> includes protein-bound and free hormone levels that occur in response to TSH secretion. T<sub>4</sub> is 70% bound to TBG; T<sub>3</sub> is bound less firmly. Only 0.03% of T<sub>4</sub> and 0.3% of T<sub>3</sub> are unbound. Serious systemic illnesses, medications (e.g., oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, carbamazepine, salicylates), and protein wasting as a result of nephrosis or the use of androgens may interfere with accurate test results. Normal range for T<sub>4</sub> is 5.4 to 11.5 &#x00B5;g/dL (57 to 148&#x00A0;nmol/L) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Although serum T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels generally increase or decrease together, the T<sub>3</sub> level appears to be a more accurate indicator of hyperthyroidism or severity of the disorder, as T<sub>4</sub> levels are often within normal range. The normal range for serum T<sub>3</sub> is 260 to 480 pg/dL (4.0 to 7.4 pmol/L) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">T<sub>3</sub> Resin Uptake Test</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The T<sub>3</sub> resin uptake test is an indirect measure of unsaturated TBG. Its purpose is to determine the amount of thyroid hormone bound to TBG and the number of available binding sites. This provides an index of the amount of thyroid hormone already present in the circulation. Normally, TBG is not fully saturated with thyroid hormone, and additional binding sites are available to combine with radioiodine-labeled T<sub>3</sub> added to the blood specimen. The normal T<sub>3</sub> uptake value is 25% to 35% (relative uptake fraction, 0.25 to 0.35), which indicates that about one third of the available sites of TBG are occupied by thyroid hormone. If the number of free or unoccupied binding sites is low, as in hyperthyroidism, the T<sub>3</sub> uptake is greater than 35% (0.35). If the number of available sites is high, as occurs in hypothyroidism, the test result is less than 25% (0.25).</p>
<p class="indent">T<sub>3</sub> uptake is useful in evaluating thyroid hormone levels in patients who have received diagnostic or therapeutic doses of iodine. The test results may be altered by the use of estrogens, androgens, salicylates, phenytoin, anticoagulants, or corticosteroids (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Thyroid Antibodies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Autoimmune thyroid diseases include both hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions. Results of testing by immunoassay techniques for antithyroid antibodies are positive in chronic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1455" title="1455"></span>autoimmune thyroid disease (90%), Hashimoto thyroiditis (100%), Graves disease (80%), and other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. Antithyroid antibody titers are normally present in 5% to 10% of the population and increase with age.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Radioactive Iodine Uptake</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The radioactive iodine uptake test measures the rate of iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. The patient is given a tracer dose of iodine 123 (<sup>123</sup>I) or another radionuclide, and a count is made over the thyroid gland with a scintillation counter, which detects and counts the gamma rays released from the breakdown of <sup>123</sup>I in the thyroid. The radioactive iodine uptake test is a simple test with reliable results. The test measures the proportion of the given dose that is present in the thyroid gland at a specific time after its administration. Since the test is affected by the patient&#x2019;s intake of iodide or thyroid hormone, a careful preliminary clinical history is essential in evaluating results. Normal values vary from one geographic region to another and with the intake of iodine. Patients with hyperthyroidism exhibit a high uptake of the <sup>123</sup>I (in some patients, as high as 90%), whereas patients with hypothyroidism exhibit a very low uptake.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The use of a small-gauge needle to sample the thyroid tissue for biopsy is a safe and accurate method of detecting malignancy and is often the initial test for evaluation of thyroid masses. Results are reported as benign, malignant, suspicious, or nondiagnostic/insufficient (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ross, Cooper, &#x0026; Mulder, 2019</a>). Within the malignancy category, masses are reported as a follicular neoplasm or a follicular lesion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Thyroid Scan, Radioscan, or Scintiscan</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In a thyroid scan, a scintillation detector or gamma camera moves back and forth across the area to be studied in a series of parallel tracks, and a visual image is made of the distribution of radioactivity in the area being scanned. The most commonly used isotopes of iodine are <sup>123</sup>I and <sup>131</sup>I (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Scans are helpful in determining the location, size, shape, and anatomic function of the thyroid gland, particularly when thyroid tissue is substernal or large (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). Identifying areas of increased function (&#x201C;hot&#x201D; areas) or decreased function (&#x201C;cold&#x201D; areas) can assist in diagnosis. Although most areas of decreased function do not represent malignancies, lack of function increases the likelihood of malignancy, particularly if only one nonfunctioning area is present. Scanning of the entire body, to obtain the total body profile, may be carried out in a search for a functioning thyroid metastasis (i.e., a lesion that produces thyroid hormones).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Serum Thyroglobulin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Thyroglobulin (Tg) can be measured reliably in the serum by radioimmunoassay. Clinically, it is used to detect persistence or recurrence of thyroid carcinoma.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1959">Nursing Implications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Since thyroid tests involve the use of iodine, determining if the patient has any allergies to iodine or is taking medications that contain iodine is essential. The relationship between having an allergy to shellfish and having an allergy to iodine is a long held belief; however, an allergy to shellfish is due to specific proteins in the shellfish and not iodine (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3410">American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, 2019</a>). Patients should be asked if they have had a reaction to iodine previously and to shellfish so that the radiologist can determine what precautions need to be taken, if any (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3410">American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, 2019</a>). Patients should be asked about obvious sources of iodine-containing medications such as contrast agents and those used to treat thyroid disorders such as radioactive iodine. They should also be asked whether they eat kelp or seaweed. Numerous medications may also affect test results because they affect the thyroid. Chart 45-2 gives a list of select medications that may interfere with accurate testing of thyroid gland function (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Fischbach &#x0026; Fischbach, 2018</a>). This information should be documented in the patient&#x2019;s electronic health record (EHR) and communicated clearly to personnel conducting the test.</p>
