<h4 class="h4" id="s221">Potassium Imbalances</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is the major intracellular electrolyte; in fact, 98% of the body&#x2019;s potassium is inside the cells. The remaining 2% is in the ECF and is important to neuromuscular and cardiac function. Potassium influences both skeletal and cardiac muscle activity. For example, alterations in K<sup>+</sup> concentration can change myocardial irritability and rhythm. Under the influence of the sodium&#x2013;potassium pump, potassium is constantly being pumped into the cells. The normal serum potassium concentration ranges from 3.5 to 5 mEq/L (3.5 to 5 mmol/L), and even minor variations are significant (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>). Potassium imbalances are commonly associated with various diseases, injuries, medications (e.g., NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors), and acid&#x2013;base imbalances (Mount, 2017a). The two types of potassium imbalances are potassium deficit and potassium excess (<a href="#tt10-7">Table&#x00A0;10-7</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">To maintain potassium balance, the renal system must function, because 80% of the potassium excreted daily leaves the body by way of the kidneys; the other 20% is lost through the bowel and in sweat. The kidneys regulate potassium balance by adjusting the amount of potassium that is excreted in the urine. As serum potassium levels increase, so does the potassium level in the renal tubular cell. A concentration gradient occurs, favoring the movement of potassium into the renal tubule and excretion of potassium in the urine. Aldosterone also increases the excretion of potassium by the kidney. Because the kidneys do not conserve potassium as well as they conserve sodium, potassium may still be lost in urine in the presence of a potassium deficit (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s222">Potassium Deficit (Hypokalemia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hypokalemia (serum potassium level below 3.5 mEq/L [3.5 mmol/L]) usually indicates a deficit in total potassium stores. However, it may occur in patients with normal potassium stores: When <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;alkalosis:&lt;/b&gt; an acid&#x2013;base imbalance characterized by a reduction in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration or increase in bicarbonate concentration (increased blood pH) (A high arterial pH with either decreased H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion concentration or increased bicarbonate concentration is called &lt;em&gt;metabolic alkalosis;&lt;/em&gt; a high arterial pH due to reduced PCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is called &lt;em&gt;respiratory alkalosis.&lt;/em&gt;)">alkalosis</button></strong> (high blood pH) is present, a temporary shift of serum potassium into the cells occurs (see later discussion).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s223">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Potassium-losing diuretics, such as the thiazides and loop diuretics, can induce hypokalemia. Other medications that can lead to hypokalemia include corticosteroids, sodium penicillin, and amphotericin B (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>). GI loss of potassium is another common cause of potassium depletion. Vomiting and gastric suction frequently lead to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page244" title="244"></span>hypokalemia, because potassium is lost when gastric fluid is lost and because potassium is lost through the kidneys in response to metabolic alkalosis. Because relatively large amounts of potassium are contained in intestinal fluids, potassium deficit occurs frequently with diarrhea, which may contain as much potassium as 30 mEq/L. Potassium deficit also occurs from prolonged intestinal suctioning, recent ileostomy, and villous adenoma (a tumor of the intestinal tract characterized by excretion of potassium-rich mucus) (Mount, 2017b).</p>
<p class="indent">Alterations in acid&#x2013;base balance have a significant effect on potassium distribution due to shifts of hydrogen and potassium ions between the cells and the ECF. Respiratory or metabolic alkalosis promotes the transcellular shift of potassium and can have a variable and unpredictable effect on serum potassium. For example, hydrogen ions move out of the cells into the bloodstream in alkalotic states to help correct the high pH, and potassium ions move into the cells to maintain an electrically neutral state (Mount, 2017c) (see later discussion of acid&#x2013;base balance).</p>
<p class="indent">Aldosterone from the adrenal gland acts on the nephron to increase sodium and water reabsorption into the bloodstream. It simultaneously secretes potassium into the renal tubules which in turn is excreted in the urine. In hyperaldosteronism, potassium is constantly secreted into the nephron tubule fluid which leads to loss of potassium into the urine. Hyperaldosteronism causes renal potassium wasting and can lead to severe potassium depletion. Primary hyperaldosteronism is seen in patients with adrenal adenomas (tumors). Secondary hyperaldosteronism occurs in patients with cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, or malignant hypertension (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib761">Dick, Queiroz, Bernardi, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Insulin promotes the entry of potassium into cells from the bloodstream; therefore, patients with persistent insulin hypersecretion may experience hypokalemia. Patients receiving high carbohydrate parenteral nutrition will have increased secretion of insulin. This will cause the shift of potassium into the cells from the bloodstream, causing hypokalemia. In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), potassium moves out of the cell since H<sup>+</sup> ions are high; during this acute phase it seems as though the patient has hyperkalemia. With insulin treatment of DKA, potassium moves back into the cells, causing hypokalemia (Palmer &#x0026; Clegg, 2016a).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are not able to eat a normal diet for a prolonged period are at risk for hypokalemia. This may occur in debilitated older adults and in patients with alcoholism or anorexia nervosa. In addition to poor intake, people with bulimia frequently experience increased potassium loss through self-induced vomiting and overuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas. These patients may also be deficient in magnesium. Magnesium depletion also causes renal potassium loss and must be corrected first; otherwise, urine loss of potassium will continue (Mount, 2017d).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s224">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Potassium deficiency can result in widespread derangements in physiologic function. Severe hypokalemia can cause death through cardiac or respiratory arrest. Clinical signs develop when the potassium level decreases to less than 3 mEq/L (3 mmol/L) (Mount, 2017b). Clinical signs and symptoms can be found in <a href="#tt10-7">Table&#x00A0;10-7</a>. If prolonged, hypokalemia can lead to an inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, causing dilute urine (resulting in polyuria, nocturia) and excessive thirst. Potassium depletion suppresses the release of insulin and results in glucose intolerance (Palmer &#x0026; Clegg, 2016a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s225">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In hypokalemia, the serum potassium concentration is less than the lower limit of normal, which is 3.5 mEq/L. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes can include flat T waves or inverted T waves or both, suggesting ischemia, and depressed ST segments (<a href="#ff10-8">Fig.&#x00A0;10-8</a>). An elevated U wave is specific to hypokalemia.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Hypokalemia increases sensitivity to digitalis, predisposing the patient to digitalis toxicity at lower digitalis levels.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Metabolic alkalosis is commonly associated with hypokalemia. This is discussed further in the section on acid&#x2013;base disturbances in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The source of the potassium loss is usually evident from a careful history. However, if the cause of the loss is unclear, a 24-hour urinary potassium excretion test can be performed to distinguish between renal and extrarenal loss. Urinary potassium excretion exceeding 20 mEq/day with hypokalemia suggests that renal potassium loss is the cause.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s226">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If hypokalemia cannot be prevented by conventional measures such as increased intake in the daily diet or by oral potassium supplements for deficiencies, then it is treated cautiously with IV replacement therapy (Mount, 2017b). Potassium loss must be corrected daily; administration of 40 to 60 mEq/day of potassium is adequate in the adult if there are no abnormal losses of potassium.</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are at risk for hypokalemia, a diet containing sufficient potassium should be provided. Dietary intake of potassium in the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq/day. Foods high in potassium include most fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, milk, and meat (Palmer &#x0026; Clegg, 2016b).</p>
<p class="indent">When dietary intake is inadequate for any reason, oral or IV potassium supplements may be prescribed. Many salt substitutes contain 50 to 60 mEq of potassium per teaspoon and may be sufficient to prevent hypokalemia. If oral administration of potassium is not feasible, the IV route is indicated. The IV route is mandatory for patients with severe hypokalemia (e.g., serum level of 2 mEq/L). Although potassium chloride (KCl) is usually used to correct potassium deficits, potassium acetate or potassium phosphate may be prescribed (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib798">Mount, 2017e; Vallerand &#x0026; Sanoski, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s227">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because hypokalemia can be life-threatening, the nurse needs to monitor for its early presence in patients at risk. Fatigue, anorexia, muscle weakness, decreased bowel motility, paresthesias, and arrhythmias are signals that warrant assessing the serum potassium concentration. When available, the ECG may provide useful information (Mount, 2017b). For example, patients receiving digitalis who are at risk for potassium deficiency should be monitored closely for signs of digitalis toxicity, because hypokalemia potentiates the action of digitalis.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Hypokalemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse helps prevent hypokalemia by encouraging patients at risk to eat foods rich in potassium (when the diet allows). Consumption of foods high in potassium should be encouraged; examples include bananas, melon, citrus fruits, fresh and frozen vegetables (avoid canned vegetables), lean meats, milk, and whole grains. If the hypokalemia is caused by abuse of laxatives or diuretics, patient education may help alleviate the problem. Part of the health history and assessment should be directed at identifying problems that are amenable to prevention through education. Careful monitoring of fluid I&#x0026;O is necessary, because 40 mEq of potassium is lost for every liter of urine output. The ECG is monitored for changes, and arterial blood gas (ABG) values are checked for elevated bicarbonate and pH levels.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Correcting Hypokalemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The oral route is ideal to treat mild to moderate hypokalemia because oral potassium supplements are well absorbed. Care should be exercised when administering potassium, particularly in older adults, who have lower lean body mass and total-body potassium levels and therefore lower potassium requirements. In addition, because of the physiologic loss of renal function with advancing years, potassium may be retained more readily in older than in younger people (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Cash &#x0026; Glass, 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Oral potassium supplements can produce small bowel lesions; therefore, the patient must be assessed for and cautioned about abdominal distention, pain, or GI bleeding.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Administering Intravenous Potassium</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Potassium should be given only after adequate urine output has been established. A decrease in urine volume to less than 20 mL/h for 2 consecutive hours is an indication to stop the potassium infusion and notify the primary provider. Potassium is primarily excreted by the kidneys; when oliguria occurs, potassium administration can cause the serum potassium concentration to rise to dangerous levels (Mount, 2017e).</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Potassium is never given by IV push or intramuscularly to avoid replacing potassium too quickly. Potassium is extremely irritating to tissues. IV potassium must be given using an infusion pump.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Each health care facility has its own policy for the administration of potassium, which must be consulted. Administration of IV potassium is done with extreme caution using an infusion pump with the patient monitored by continuous ECG. Caution must be used when selecting a premixed solution of IV fluid containing KCl, as the concentrations range from 10 to 40 mEq/100 mL. Renal function should be monitored through BUN and serum creatinine levels and urine output if the patient is receiving potassium replacement. During replacement therapy, the patient should be monitored for signs of worsening hypokalemia as well as hyperkalemia.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s228">Potassium Excess (Hyperkalemia)</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Hyperkalemia (serum potassium level greater than 5 mEq/L [5 mmol/L]) seldom occurs in patients with normal renal function. In older adults, there is an increased risk of hyperkalemia due to decreases in renin and aldosterone as well as an increased number of comorbid cardiac conditions. Like hypokalemia, hyperkalemia is often caused by iatrogenic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" title="246"></span>(treatment-induced) causes. Although hyperkalemia is less common than hypokalemia, it is usually more dangerous because cardiac arrest is more frequently associated with high serum potassium levels (Mount, 2017a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s229">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Major causes of hyperkalemia are decreased renal excretion of potassium, rapid administration of potassium, and movement of potassium from the ICF compartment to the ECF compartment. Hyperkalemia is commonly seen in patients with untreated kidney injury, particularly those in whom potassium levels increase as a result of infection or excessive intake of potassium in food or medications (Mount, 2017a). Patients with hypoaldosteronism or Addison disease are at risk for hyperkalemia because of a lack of aldosterone. Lack of aldosterone activity at the nephron causes inadequate sodium and water reabsorption into the bloodstream and inadequate excretion of potassium in the urine. Therefore, deficient adrenal hormones lead to sodium loss and potassium retention (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Medications have been identified as a probable contributing factor in more than 60% of hyperkalemic episodes. Medications commonly implicated are KCl, heparin, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, beta-blockers, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and potassium-sparing diuretics (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Potassium regulation is compromised in acute and chronic kidney disease, with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10% to 20% of normal (Mount, 2017c).</p>
<p class="indent">Improper use of potassium supplements predisposes all patients to hyperkalemia, especially if salt substitutes are used. Not all patients receiving potassium-losing diuretics require potassium supplements, and patients receiving potassium-conserving diuretics should not receive supplements.</p>
<div class="clinicaltip1">
<img class="clinicaltip1" src="images/alert.png" alt=""/>
<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Potassium supplements are extremely dangerous for patients who have impaired renal function and thus decreased ability to excrete potassium. Even more dangerous is the IV administration of potassium to such patients, because serum levels can rise very quickly. It is possible to exceed the renal tolerance of any patient with rapid IV potassium administration, as well as when large amounts of oral potassium supplements are ingested.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">In <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;acidosis:&lt;/b&gt; an acid&#x2013;base imbalance characterized by an increase in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (decreased blood pH) (A low arterial pH due to increased H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration or reduced bicarbonate concentration is called &lt;em&gt;metabolic acidosis;&lt;/em&gt; a low arterial pH due to increased PCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is called &lt;em&gt;respiratory acidosis.&lt;/em&gt;)">acidosis</button></strong> (low blood pH), potassium moves out of the cells and into the ECF. This occurs as hydrogen ions enter the cells to buffer the pH of the ECF (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="indent">An elevated ECF potassium level should be anticipated when extensive tissue trauma has occurred, as in burns, crushing injuries, or severe infections. Similarly, it can occur with lysis of malignant cells after chemotherapy (i.e., tumor lysis syndrome). Any disorder that causes high amounts of cellular lysis or deterioration can cause hyperkalemia (Mount, 2017a).</p>
<p class="indent">Pseudohyperkalemia (a false hyperkalemia) has several causes, including the improper collection or transport of a blood sample, a traumatic venipuncture, and use of a tight tourniquet around an exercising extremity while drawing a blood sample, producing hemolysis of the sample before analysis. Other causes include marked leukocytosis (white blood cell count exceeding 200,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) and thrombocytosis (platelet count exceeding 1 million/mm<sup>3</sup>); drawing blood above a site where potassium is infusing; and familial pseudohyperkalemia, in which potassium leaks out of the RBCs while the blood is awaiting analysis. Lack of awareness of these causes of pseudohyperkalemia can lead to aggressive treatment of a nonexistent hyperkalemia, resulting in serious lowering of serum potassium levels. Therefore, measurements of grossly elevated levels of potassium in the absence of clinical manifestations (e.g., normal ECG) should be verified by retesting (Mount, 2017a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s230">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinical signs and symptoms can be found in <a href="#tt10-7">Table&#x00A0;10-7</a>. The most important consequence of hyperkalemia is its effect on the myocardium. Cardiac effects of elevated serum potassium are usually not significant when the level is less than 7 mEq/L (7 mmol/L); however, they are almost always present when the level is 8 mEq/L (8 mmol/L) or greater. As the plasma potassium level rises, disturbances in cardiac conduction occur. The earliest changes, often occurring at a serum potassium level greater than 6 mEq/L (6 mmol/L), are peaked, narrow T waves; ST-segment depression; and a shortened QT interval. If the serum potassium level continues to increase, the PR interval becomes prolonged and is followed by disappearance of the P waves. Finally, there is decomposition and widening of the QRS complex (see <a href="c10-sec05.xhtml#ff10-7">Fig.&#x00A0;10-7</a>). Ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest may occur (Mount, 2017a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s231">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Serum potassium levels and ECG changes are crucial to the diagnosis of hyperkalemia, as discussed previously. ABG analysis may reveal either a metabolic or a respiratory acidosis. These are discussed further in the section on acid&#x2013;base disturbances in this chapter. Correcting the acidosis helps correct the hyperkalemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s232">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In disorders involving potassium level changes, an ECG should be obtained immediately. Shortened repolarization and peaked T waves are seen initially in hyperkalemia. To verify results, a repeat serum potassium level should be obtained from a vein that is not concomitantly infusing an IV solution containing potassium (Mount, 2017e).</p>
<p class="indent">In nonacute situations, restriction of dietary potassium and potassium-containing medications may correct the imbalance. For example, eliminating the use of potassium-containing salt substitutes in a patient who is taking a potassium-conserving diuretic may be all that is needed to deal with mild hyperkalemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Administration, either orally or by retention enema, of cation exchange resins (e.g., sodium polystyrene sulfonate) may be necessary. The use of cation exchange resins requires normal bowel function. For instance, cation exchange resins cannot be used if the patient has a paralytic ileus (i.e., absence of peristalsis in the intestine), because intestinal perforation can occur. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate binds with potassium and then is eliminated in the feces. Other cations in the GI tract can also be depleted which can cause hypomagnesemia <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page247" title="247"></span>and hypocalcemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate may also cause sodium retention and fluid overload and should be used with caution in patients with heart failure (Frandsen &#x0026; Pennington, 2018; Mount, 2017e).</p>
<p class="indent">Patiromer sorbitex calcium is another oral agent that is a potassium-removing resin used to treat hyperkalemia. It exchanges calcium for potassium in the lower intestine, thereby increasing fecal excretion of potassium. Side effects include GI intolerance, hypomagnesemia, and edema (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib760">Depret, Peacock, Liu, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Emergency Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If serum potassium levels are dangerously elevated, it may be necessary to administer IV calcium gluconate. Within minutes after administration, calcium antagonizes the action of hyperkalemia on the heart but does not reduce the serum potassium concentration. Calcium chloride and calcium gluconate are not interchangeable; calcium gluconate contains 4.5 mEq of calcium, and calcium chloride contains 13.6 mEq of calcium. Therefore, caution is required when using calcium preparations to reduce potassium levels (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Ashurst, Sergent, &#x0026; Sergent, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Monitoring the blood pressure is essential to detect hypotension, which may result from the rapid IV administration of calcium gluconate. The ECG should be continuously monitored during administration; the appearance of bradycardia is an indication to stop the infusion. The myocardial protective effects of calcium last about 30 minutes. Extra caution is required if the patient has received an accelerated dose of a digitalis-based cardiac glycoside to reach a desired serum digitalis level rapidly as parenteral administration of calcium sensitizes the heart to digitalis and may precipitate digitalis toxicity (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Ashurst et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">IV administration of sodium bicarbonate may be necessary in severe metabolic acidosis to alkalinize the plasma, shift potassium into the cells, and furnish sodium to antagonize the cardiac effects of potassium. Effects of this therapy begin within 30 to 60 minutes and may persist for hours; however, they are temporary. Circulatory overload and hypernatremia can occur when large amounts of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate are given. Bicarbonate therapy should be guided by the bicarbonate concentration or calculated base deficit obtained from blood gas analysis or laboratory measurement (Mount, 2017c).</p>
<p class="indent">IV administration of regular insulin and a hypertonic dextrose solution causes a temporary shift of potassium into the cells. Glucose and insulin therapy have an onset of action within 30 minutes and lasts for several hours. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase excretion of water by inhibiting sodium, potassium, and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle and distal renal tubule (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Ashurst et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Beta-2 agonists, such as albuterol, are highly effective in decreasing potassium; however, their use is not without risk as they can cause tachycardia and chest discomfort (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Depret et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Long, Warix, &#x0026; Koyfman, 2018</a>). Beta-2 agonists, administered intravenously or via nebulizer, move potassium into the cells and may be used in the absence of ischemic cardiac disease. Their use is a stopgap measure that only temporarily protects the patient from hyperkalemia.</p>
<p class="indent">If the hyperkalemic condition is not transient, removal of potassium from the body can also be done through peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or other forms of renal replacement therapy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s233">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients at risk for potassium excess (e.g., those with kidney disease) need to be identified and closely monitored for signs of hyperkalemia. The nurse monitors I&#x0026;O and observes for signs of muscle weakness and arrhythmias. When measuring vital signs, an apical pulse should be taken. The presence of paresthesias and GI symptoms such as nausea and intestinal cramping should be noted. Serum potassium levels, as well as BUN, serum creatinine, serum glucose, and ABG values, should be monitored for patients at risk for developing hyperkalemia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Hyperkalemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Measures should be taken to prevent hyperkalemia in patients at risk, when possible, by encouraging the patient to adhere to the prescribed potassium restriction. Potassium-rich foods to be avoided include many fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole-grain breads, lean meat, milk, eggs, coffee, tea, and cocoa. Conversely, foods with minimal potassium content include butter, margarine, cranberry juice or sauce, ginger ale, gumdrops or jelly beans, hard candy, root beer, sugar, and honey. Labels of cola beverages must be checked carefully because some are high in potassium and some are not (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">McDonough &#x0026; Youn, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">It is possible to exceed the tolerance for potassium if given rapidly by the IV route. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary when administering potassium solutions. Particular attention is paid to the solution&#x2019;s concentration and rate of administration. IV administration should only be via an infusion pump (Mount, 2017e).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must caution patients to use salt substitutes sparingly if they are taking other supplementary forms of potassium or potassium-conserving diuretics. In addition, potassium-conserving diuretics, potassium supplements, and salt substitutes should not be given to patients with kidney injury (Mount, 2017e).</p>
