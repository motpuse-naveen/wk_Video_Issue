<h4 class="h4" id="s3272">Patients Who Are Underactive or Depressed</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In the ED, depression may be seen as the main condition bringing the patient to the health care facility, or it may be masked by anxiety and somatic complaints. The person who is depressed has a mood disturbance. Any patient who is depressed may be at risk for suicide. Most suicide attempts are expressions of extreme distress, not bids for attention (ENA, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient must be screened regarding any attempts or thoughts of suicide. Questions such as &#x201C;Have you ever thought about taking your own life?&#x201D; may be helpful. In general, the patient is relieved to have an opportunity to discuss personal feelings. The emergency nurse&#x2019;s responsibility when caring for a patient with depression is to maintain a high suspicion for the diagnosis, especially for those populations at risk (see following discussion) (ENA, 2020a).</p>
