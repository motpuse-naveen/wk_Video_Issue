<h4 class="h4" id="s907">INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF THE HEART</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Any of the heart&#x2019;s three layers may be affected by an infectious process. Infections are named for the layer of the heart most involved in the infectious process: infective endocarditis (endocardium), myocarditis (myocardium), and pericarditis (pericardium) (see <a href="c21-sec01.xhtml#ff21-1">Chapter 21, Fig. 21-1</a>). Rheumatic endocarditis is a unique infective endocarditis syndrome. Diagnosis of infection is made primarily on the basis of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms and echocardiography. Ideal management for all infectious diseases is prevention. IV antibiotics usually are necessary once an infection has developed in the heart.</p>
