<p class="nonindent">The ability to assess patients in a holistic manner is a skill integral to nursing, regardless of the practice setting. Eliciting a complete health history, using appropriate physical assessment skills, while respecting spiritual and cultural considerations, is critical to identifying physical and psychological problems and concerns experienced by the patient. As the first step in the nursing process, a holistic patient assessment is necessary to obtain data that enable the nurse to make accurate nursing diagnoses, identify and implement appropriate interventions, and assess their effectiveness. This chapter <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page72" title="72"></span>covers health assessment, including the complete health history and basic physical assessment techniques. Because a patient&#x2019;s nutritional status and culture are important factors in overall health and well-being, specific components of nutritional and cultural assessments are addressed.</p>
