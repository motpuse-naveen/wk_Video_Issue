<h4 class="h4" id="s773"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> <strong>Status Asthmaticus</strong></h4>
<p class="nonindent">An asthma exacerbation can range from mild to severe with potential respiratory arrest (GINA, 2019a). The term <em>status asthmaticus</em> is sometimes used to describe rapid onset, severe, and persistent asthma that does not respond to conventional therapy. The attacks can occur with little or no warning and can progress rapidly to asphyxiation. Infection, anxiety, inhaler abuse, dehydration, increased adrenergic blockage, and nonspecific irritants may contribute to these episodes. An acute episode may be precipitated by hypersensitivity to medications, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<a href="c20-sec05.xhtml#bib1572">American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &#x0026; Immunology [AAAAI], 2019</a>; GOLD, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s774">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The basic characteristics of asthma (inflammation of bronchial mucosa, constriction of the bronchiolar smooth muscle, and thickened secretions) decrease the diameter of the bronchi and occur in status asthmaticus. The most common scenario is severe bronchospasm, with mucus plugging leading to asphyxia. A ventilation&#x2013;perfusion abnormality results in hypoxemia. There is a reduced PaO<sub>2</sub> and initial respiratory alkalosis, with a decreased PaCO<sub>2</sub> and an increased pH. As status asthmaticus worsens, the PaCO<sub>2</sub> increases and the pH decreases, reflecting respiratory acidosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s775">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The clinical manifestations are the same as those seen in severe asthma; signs and symptoms include labored breathing, prolonged exhalation, distended neck veins, and wheezing. However, the extent of wheezing does not indicate the severity of the attack. As the obstruction worsens, the wheezing may disappear; this is frequently a sign of impending respiratory failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s776">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The severity of an exacerbation may be evaluated by a general assessment of the patient (degree of breathlessness, ability to talk, positioning of patient, level of alertness or cognitive function), physical assessment (respiratory rate, the use of accessory muscles, presence of central cyanosis, auscultatory findings, pulse, and pulsus paradoxus), and laboratory evaluation (peak expiratory flow after a bronchodilator, PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and pulse oximetry). Pulmonary function studies are the most accurate means of assessing an acute, severe airway obstruction, though not practical to obtain during this type of an emergent situation. Arterial blood gas measurement and/or pulse oximetry are obtained if the patient cannot perform pulmonary function maneuvers because of severe obstruction or fatigue, or if the patient does not respond to treatment. Respiratory alkalosis (low PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is the most common early finding in patients with an ongoing asthma exacerbation and is due to hyperventilation. At this early stage, relatively fewer acinar units (i.e., pulmonary alveolar units where gas exchange occurs) are obstructed/constricted compared to those that are functional, and hyperventilation occurs as part of the sympathetic response.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s777">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Close monitoring of the patient and objective reevaluation for response to therapy are key in status asthmaticus. In the emergency setting, the patient is treated initially with a short-acting beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic agonist and subsequently a short course of systemic corticosteroids, especially if the patient does not respond to the short-acting beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic agonist. Corticosteroids are critical in the therapy of status asthmaticus and are used to decrease the intense airway inflammation and swelling. Inhaled short-acting beta-2&#x2013;adrenergic agonists provide the most rapid relief from bronchospasm. A pMDI, with or without a spacer, may be used for administering the medications. However, more commonly, short-acting bronchodilators will be given via an SVN. A mouthpiece or facemask can be used and the bronchodilator is continuously given to the patient. The patient does not have to work to coordinate the breathing pattern, which can otherwise cause additional anxiety in this acute situation. The patient requires supplemental oxygen and IV fluids for hydration. Oxygen therapy is initiated to treat dyspnea, central cyanosis, and hypoxemia. High-flow supplemental oxygen is best delivered using a partial or complete non-rebreathing mask. Sedatives are contraindicated. Magnesium sulfate, a calcium antagonist, may be given to induce smooth muscle relaxation; the magnesium can relax smooth muscle and hence cause bronchodilation by competing with calcium at calcium-mediated smooth muscle&#x2013;binding sites. IV magnesium sulfate is not recommended for routine use in asthma exacerbations; however, when given as a single 2-g infusion over 20 minutes, it may be helpful in treating patients who present with severely compromised pulmonary function, who have not responded <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page643" title="643"></span>to initial therapy, and with persistent hypoxemia (GINA, 2019a). Adverse effects of magnesium sulfate may include facial warmth, flushing, tingling, nausea, central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and hypotension.</p>
<p class="indent">If there is no response to repeated treatments, hospitalization is required. Other criteria for hospitalization include poor pulmonary function test results and deteriorating blood gas levels (respiratory acidosis), which may indicate that the patient is tiring and will require mechanical ventilation. Most patients do not need mechanical ventilation, but it is used for patients in respiratory failure, for those who tire and are too fatigued by the attempt to breathe, and for those whose condition does not respond to initial treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">For a very select group of patients with uncontrolled severe asthma, bronchial thermoplasty may be considered. Bronchial thermoplasty is the first nondrug therapy for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma. It consists of controlled radiofrequency heating of the central airways through a bronchoscope. The thermal energy reduces the amount of smooth muscle involved in bronchospasm and potentially decreases the severity and frequency of symptoms. This therapy is invasive and relatively new; therefore, only select centers have the ability to perform this procedure, and it should only be considered in a select group of patients (GINA, 2019a).</p>
<p class="indent">Death from asthma is associated with several risk factors, including the following (GINA, 2019a):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Past history of severe exacerbation (e.g., intubation or intensive care unit admission)</span></li>
<li><span>Hospitalizations or emergency care visits for asthma within the past year</span></li>
<li><span>Currently or having recently stopped using oral corticosteroids</span></li>
<li><span>Not using ICSs</span></li>
<li><span>Overuse of SABAs</span></li>
<li><span>Concurrent psychiatric disease or psychosocial problems</span></li>
<li><span>Poor adherence to written asthma action plan</span></li>
<li><span>Poor adherence to medication regimen</span></li>
<li><span>Presence of a food allergy</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s778">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The main focus of nursing management is to actively assess the airway and the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment. The nurse should be prepared for the next intervention if the patient does not respond to treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse vigilantly monitors the patient for the first 12 to 24 hours, or until the severe exacerbation resolves. The nurse also assesses the patient&#x2019;s skin turgor for signs of dehydration. Fluid intake is essential to combat dehydration, to loosen secretions, and to facilitate expectoration. Nurses administer IV fluids as prescribed, up to 3 to 4 L/day, unless contraindicated. Blood pressure and cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously during the acute phase and until the patient stabilizes and responds to therapy. The patient&#x2019;s energy needs to be conserved, and his or her room should be quiet and free of respiratory irritants, including flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents. Nonallergenic pillows should be used. An asthma attack may also be precipitated or aggravated by exposure to latex if the patient has a latex allergy; therefore, this type of hypersensitivity must be identified and latex-free products used, as warranted. Once the exacerbation is resolved, the factors that precipitated the exacerbation should be identified and strategies for their future avoidance implemented. In addition, the patient&#x2019;s medication plan should be reviewed.</p>
