<h4 class="h4" id="s26">Purpose of Health Education</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Today&#x2019;s health care environment mandates the use of an organized approach to <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health education:&lt;/b&gt; various learning experiences designed to promote behaviors that facilitate health">health education</button></strong> (learning experiences designed to promote behaviors that facilitate health) so that patients can meet their specific health care needs. There are many reasons for providing health education.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s27">Meeting Nursing Standards</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Teaching, as a function of nursing, is included in all state nurse practice acts and in the American Nurses Association&#x2019;s (ANA&#x2019;s) <em>Scope and Standards of Practice</em> (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib140">ANA, 2015</a>). Health teaching and health promotion are independent functions of nursing practice and essential nursing responsibilities. All nursing care is directed toward promoting, maintaining, and restoring health; preventing illness; and helping people adapt to the residual effects of illness. Many of these nursing activities are accomplished through patient education. Nurses are challenged to focus on the health education needs of communities and to provide specific patient and family education. Health education is important to nursing care because it affects the abilities of people and families to perform important self-care activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Every contact a nurse has with a health care consumer, whether or not that person is ill, should be considered an opportunity for health education. Although people have a right to decide whether to learn, nurses have the responsibility to present information that motivates people to recognize the need to learn. Therefore, nurses must use opportunities in all health care settings to promote wellness. There are many educational environments. Some examples include homes, hospitals, community health centers, schools, places of business, service agencies, shelters, and consumer action or support groups (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">deChesnay &#x0026; Anderson, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s28">Supporting Informed Decision Making and Self-Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The emphasis on health education stems in part from the public&#x2019;s right to comprehensive health care, which includes up-to-date health information. It also reflects the emergence of an informed public that is asking more questions about health and health care. Because of the importance that American society places on health and the responsibility that all people must maintain and promote their own health, members of the health care team, specifically nurses, are obligated to make health education available. Significant factors to consider when planning patient education include the availability of health care, the use of diverse health care providers to accomplish care management goals, and the increased use of complementary and alternative strategies rather than traditional approaches to care. Without adequate knowledge and training in self-care skills, consumers cannot make informed decisions about their health. Guidance from nurses may assist consumers to obtain health information from trustworthy, credible, and timely Internet resources, as well as from appropriate health promotion practitioners and researchers (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib168">Cohn, Lyman, Broshek, et al., 2018</a>). People with chronic illnesses and disability are among those most in need of health education. As the lifespan of the population increases, the number of people with such illnesses also increases. Health information targeted at identifying and managing the exacerbations or issues commonly associated with having a chronic illness or disability is a major focus of health education. People with chronic illness need health care information to participate actively in and assume responsibility for self-care. Health education can help those with chronic illness adapt to their illness, prevent complications, carry out prescribed therapy, and solve problems when confronted with new situations. It can also help to prevent crisis situations and reduce the potential for rehospitalization resulting from inadequate information about self-care. The goal of health education is to teach people to live a healthy life and strive toward achieving their maximum health potential.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the public&#x2019;s right to and desire for health education, patient education is also a strategy for promoting self-care at home and in the community, reducing health care costs by preventing illness, effectively managing necessary therapies, avoiding expensive medical interventions, decreasing lengths of hospital stay, and facilitating earlier discharge. For health care agencies, offering community wellness programs is a public relations tool for increasing patient satisfaction and for developing a positive image of the institution. Patient education is also a cost-avoidance strategy in that positive staff&#x2013;patient relationships may avert malpractice suits. Some insurance companies support health education through reimbursement for programs, such as diabetes management classes and fitness and weight management programs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s29">Promoting Adherence to the Therapeutic Regimen</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One of the goals of patient education is to encourage people to adhere to their <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;therapeutic regimen:&lt;/b&gt; a routine that promotes health and healing">therapeutic regimen</button></strong> (a routine that promotes health and healing). <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adherence:&lt;/b&gt; the process of faithfully following guidelines or directions">Adherence</button></strong> (the process of faithfully following guidelines or directions) to treatment usually requires that a person make one or more lifestyle changes to carry out specific activities that promote and maintain health. Common examples of behaviors facilitating health include taking prescribed medications, maintaining a healthy diet, increasing daily activities and exercise, self-monitoring for signs and symptoms of illness and changes in baseline health status, practicing specific hygiene measures, seeking recommended health evaluations and screening, and performing other therapeutic and preventive measures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Factors Affecting Adherence</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many people do not adhere to their prescribed regimens; rates of adherence are generally low, especially when the regimens are complex or of long duration (e.g., therapy for chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, hypertension, breast cancer, human immune deficiency virus [HIV] infection, hemodialysis). Nonadherence to prescribed therapy has been the subject of many studies (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib160">Al-Noumani, Wu, Barksdale, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib176">Hine, Smith, Eshun-Wilson, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib181">Lambert, Balneaves, Howard, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib182">Lavielle, Puyraimond-Zenmour, Romand, et al., 2018</a>). For the most part, findings have been inconclusive, and no one predominant causative factor has been identified. Instead, a wide range of variables influences the degree of adherence, including the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Demographic variables, such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and level of education</span></li>
<li><span>Illness variables, such as the severity of the illness and the relief of symptoms afforded by the therapy</span></li>
<li><span>Therapeutic regimen variables, such as the complexity of the regimen, treatment fatigue, and uncomfortable side effects</span></li>
<li><span>Psychosocial variables, such as intelligence, motivation, availability of significant and supportive people (especially family members and significant others), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page58" title="58"></span>competing or conflicting demands, attitudes toward health professionals, acceptance or denial of illness, substance abuse, and religious or cultural beliefs</span></li>
<li><span>Financial variables, especially the direct and indirect costs associated with a prescribed regimen</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Another factor to consider when the nurse is developing strategies to promote patient adherence is the concept of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health literacy:&lt;/b&gt; the capability of a person to obtain, communicate, process, and understand essential health information for the purpose of securing health care services and for making health care decisions">health literacy</button></strong> or the capability of a person to obtain, communicate, process, and understand essential health information for the purpose of securing health care services and for making health care decisions. A challenge for all health care providers is to improve the health literacy of patients. In establishing suitable health education materials, technologic innovations and services, providers must communicate health information in plain language and work with patients to promote accurate processing and understanding of the health information. Nurses must consider their knowledge of the myriad factors that affect health literacy in any given population. The primary factors influencing health literacy are the effective use of communication and cultural skills, along with the presentation of health care information, and a basic background of mathematical skills. Without such skills, patients are at risk for being unable to share personal health information, perform self-care management for both acute and chronic health conditions, navigate through health systems and complete health forms, and calculate information such as nutritional information on food labels (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Carrara &#x0026; Schulz, 2018</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Osborne, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Health literacy skills are basic to understanding the body and how it functions, assessing lifestyle choices along with the variables that cause and perpetuate disease, as well as making health care decisions. If people have low health literacy, the consequence is poor overall health. Deconstructing this cycle of low health literacy leading to poor health status and higher risk of health problems is essential. To increase health literacy, providers must design and distribute accurate health information and must ensure that these health materials are culturally appropriate for various populations. It is imperative to build community partnerships to support education and public health activities. Nurses can be instrumental in performing evaluation research on the educational undertakings that support individuals, groups, or communities. Furthermore, nurses must be directly involved in facilitating change through the development of health care policies that address the promotion of a health literate society (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Patton, Zalon, &#x0026; Ludwick, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses&#x2019; success with health education is determined by both the development of strong health literacy and the ongoing assessment of the variables that affect patients&#x2019; ability to adopt specific behaviors to obtain resources, and maintain a healthy social environment (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Edelman &#x0026; Kudzma, 2018</a>). Programs are more likely to succeed if patients have improved health literacy and providers pay careful attention to the variables affecting patient adherence. Both health literacy and the concept of adherence must be considered in the patient&#x2019;s teaching plan. Teaching strategies are discussed later in the chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Motivation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The problem of nonadherence to therapeutic regimens is substantial and must be addressed before patients can achieve their maximum health potential. Patients&#x2019; need for knowledge has not been found to be a sufficient stimulus for acquiring knowledge and thereby enabling complete adherence to a health regimen. Teaching directed toward stimulating patient motivation results in varying degrees of adherence. Research suggests that factors such as personal relevance of strategies for self-care, perceived control, and type of health problem must also be considered (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib189">Seibre, Toumpakari, Turner, et al., 2018</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib195">Whiteley, Brown, Lally, et al., 2018</a>). The variables of choice, establishment of mutual goals, and quality of the patient&#x2013;provider relationship also influence the behavioral changes that can result from patient education. Many factors are linked to motivation for learning.</p>
<p class="indent">Using a learning contract or agreement can also be a motivator for learning. Such a contract is based on assessment of patient needs; health care data; and specific, measurable goals (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Miller &#x0026; Stoeckel, 2019</a>). The learning contract is recorded in writing and contains methods for ongoing evaluation. A well-designed learning contract is realistic and positive. In a typical learning contract, a series of measurable goals is established, beginning with small, easily attainable objectives and progressing to more advanced goals. Frequent, positive reinforcement is provided as the person moves from one goal to the next. For example, incremental goals such as weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week are more appropriate in a weight reduction program than a general goal such as a 30-pound weight loss.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nonadherence to therapeutic regimens is a significant problem for older adults, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and cost of treatment (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib158">Abada, Clark, Sinha, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib191">Taylor, Coogle, Cotter, et al., 2019</a>). Many admissions to nursing homes and hospitals are associated with nonadherence.</p>
<p class="indent">Older adults frequently have one or more chronic illnesses that are managed with numerous medications, and their disease course may be complicated by periodic acute episodes (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Miller, 2019</a>). Older adults may have additional issues that affect adherence to therapeutic regimens, such as increased sensitivity to medications and their side effects, difficulty in adjusting to change and stress, financial constraints, forgetfulness, inadequate support systems, lifetime habits of self-treatment with over-the-counter medications, visual and hearing impairments, and mobility limitations. To promote adherence among older adults, all variables that may affect health behavior should be assessed (<a href="c03-sec02.xhtml#ff3-1">Fig.&#x00A0;3-1</a>). Nurses must also consider that cognitive impairment may result in the older adult&#x2019;s inability to draw inferences, apply information, or understand the major points (<a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Mauk, 2017</a>; <a href="c03-sec06.xhtml#bib206">Touhy &#x0026; Jett, 2018</a>). The person&#x2019;s strengths and limitations must be assessed to encourage the use of existing strengths to compensate for limitations. Above all, health care professionals must work together to provide continuous, coordinated care; otherwise, the efforts of one health care professional may be negated by those of another.</p>
