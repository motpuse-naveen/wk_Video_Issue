Body fluid is contained in the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Intracellular fluid accounts for about two thirds of the total body water. The extracellular body fluid is found in one of two compartments: intravascular (inside blood vessels) or interstitial (surrounding tissues). The volume of interstitial fluid is about three to four times that of intravascular fluid. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a reduction in intravascular volume by 15% to 30%, which represents an approximate loss of 750 to 1500 mL of blood in a 70-kg (154-lb) person (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib843">American College of Surgeons, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s342">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypovolemic shock can be caused by external fluid losses, as in traumatic blood loss, or by internal fluid shifts, as in severe dehydration, severe edema, or ascites (<a href="#ct11-3">Chart&#x00A0;11-3</a>). Intravascular volume can be reduced by both fluid loss and fluid shifting between the intravascular and interstitial compartments.</p>

<p class="indent">The sequence of events in hypovolemic shock begins with a decrease in the intravascular volume. This results in decreased venous return of blood to the heart and subsequent decreased ventricular filling. Decreased ventricular filling results in decreased stroke volume (amount of blood ejected from the heart) and decreased cardiac output. When cardiac output drops, BP drops and tissues cannot be adequately perfused (<a href="#ff11-4">Fig.&#x00A0;11-4</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s343"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Major goals in the treatment of hypovolemic shock are to restore intravascular volume to reverse the sequence of events leading to inadequate tissue perfusion, to redistribute <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page286" title="286"></span>fluid volume, and to correct the underlying cause of the fluid loss as quickly as possible. Depending on the severity of shock and the patient&#x2019;s condition, often all three goals are addressed simultaneously.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Treatment of the Underlying Cause</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient is hemorrhaging, efforts are made to stop the bleeding. This may involve applying pressure to the bleeding site or surgical interventions to stop internal bleeding. If the cause of the hypovolemia is diarrhea or vomiting, medications to treat diarrhea and vomiting are given while efforts are made to identify and treat the cause. In older adult patients, dehydration may be the cause of hypovolemic shock.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluid and Blood Replacement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Beyond reversing the primary cause of the decreased intravascular volume, fluid replacement is of primary concern. At least two large-gauge IV lines are inserted to establish access for fluid administration. If an IV catheter cannot be quickly inserted, an intraosseous catheter may be used for access in the sternum, legs (tibia), or arms (humerus) to facilitate rapid fluid replacement (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib860">Clemency, Tanaka, May, et al., 2017</a>). Multiple IV lines allow simultaneous administration of fluid, medications, and blood component therapy if required. Because the goal of the fluid replacement is to restore intravascular volume, it is necessary to administer fluids that will remain in the intravascular compartment to avoid fluid shifts from the intravascular compartment into the intracellular compartment. <a href="#tt11-3">Table&#x00A0;11-3</a> summarizes the fluids commonly used in the treatment of shock.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed earlier, crystalloid solutions such as lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution are commonly used to treat hypovolemic shock, as large amounts of fluid must be given to restore intravascular volume. If hypovolemia is primarily due to blood loss, the American College of Surgeons (2018) recommends administration of 3 mL of crystalloid solution for each milliliter of estimated blood loss. This is referred to as the 3:1 rule. Colloid solutions (e.g., albumin) may also be used. Hetastarch and dextran solutions are not indicated for fluid administration because these agents interfere with platelet aggregation.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Blood products, which are also colloids, may need to be given, particularly if the cause of the hypovolemic shock is hemorrhage. The decision to give blood is based on the patient&#x2019;s lack of response to crystalloid resuscitation, the volume of blood lost, the need for hemoglobin to assist with oxygen transport, and the necessity to correct the patient&#x2019;s coagulopathy. Patients requiring massive transfusion respond better when blood products are given in a 1:1:1 ratio, meaning units of plasma, platelets, and packed red blood cells (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib872">Holcomb, Tiley, Baraniuk, et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Packed red blood cells are given to replenish the patient&#x2019;s oxygen-carrying capacity in conjunction with other fluids that will expand volume. Plasma and platelets are transfused to assist with coagulation and hemostasis. The need for transfusions is based on the patient&#x2019;s oxygenation needs and coagulation status, which are determined by vital signs, blood gas, chemistry, coagulation laboratory values, and clinical appearance.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Redistribution of Fluid</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to administering fluids to restore intravascular volume, positioning the patient properly assists fluid redistribution. PLR may be used to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s responsiveness to fluids and continued resuscitation efforts (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Simmons &#x0026; Ventetuolo, 2017</a>). The nurse assesses for an improvement in the patient&#x2019;s vital signs, specifically a rise in the BP. Trendelenburg is not indicated as this position makes breathing difficult and does not increase BP or cardiac output (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Bridges &#x0026; Jarquin-Valdivia, 2005</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If fluid administration fails to reverse hypovolemic shock, then vasoactive medications that prevent cardiac failure are given. Medications are also given to reverse the cause of the dehydration. For example, insulin is given if dehydration is secondary to hyperglycemia, desmopressin is given for diabetes insipidus, antidiarrheal agents for diarrhea, and antiemetic medications for vomiting.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 286</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page287" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="287">p. 287</span></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s344"><img src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/>&#x00A0;Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary prevention of shock is an essential focus of nursing care. Hypovolemic shock can be prevented in some instances by closely monitoring patients who are at risk for fluid deficits and assisting with fluid replacement before intravascular volume is depleted. In other circumstances, nursing care focuses on assisting with treatment targeted at the cause of the shock and restoring intravascular volume.</p>
<p class="indent">General nursing measures include ensuring safe administration of prescribed fluids and medications and documenting their administration and effects. Volumetric IV pumps should be used to administer prescribed vasopressor medications. Another important nursing role is monitoring for complications and side effects of treatment and reporting them promptly.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Administering Blood and Fluids Safely</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Administering blood transfusions safely is a vital nursing role. In emergency situations, it is important to acquire blood specimens quickly, to obtain a baseline complete blood count, and to type and crossmatch the blood in anticipation of blood transfusions. A patient who receives a transfusion of blood products must be monitored closely for adverse effects (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Fluid replacement complications can occur, especially when large volumes are given rapidly. Therefore, the nurse monitors the patient closely for cardiovascular overload and signs of difficulty breathing, a condition known as transfusion-associated circulatory overload. Transfusion-related ALI may occur and is characterized by pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and pulmonary infiltrates, usually within hours after massive transfusion (<a href="c11-sec08.xhtml#bib919">Vlaar &#x0026; Kleinman, 2019</a>). The risk of these complications is increased in older adults, in patients with preexisting cardiac disease, and with increasing number of blood products given. ACS is also a possible complication of excessive fluid resuscitation and may initially present with respiratory symptoms (difficulty breathing) and decreased urine output. Hemodynamic pressure, vital signs, arterial blood gases, serum lactate levels, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, bladder pressure monitoring, and fluid intake and output (I&#x0026;O) are among the parameters monitored. Temperature should also be monitored closely to ensure that rapid fluid resuscitation does not cause hypothermia. IV fluids may need to be warmed when large volumes are given. Physical assessment focuses on observing the jugular veins for distention and monitoring jugular venous pressure. Jugular venous pressure is low in hypovolemic shock; it increases with effective treatment and is significantly increased with fluid overload and heart failure. The nurse must monitor cardiac and respiratory status closely and report changes in BP, pulse pressure, CVP, heart rate and rhythm, and lung sounds to the primary provider.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Implementing Other Measures</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen is given to increase the amount of oxygen carried by available hemoglobin in the blood. A patient who is confused may feel apprehensive with an oxygen mask or cannula in place, and frequent explanations about the need for the mask may reduce some of the patient&#x2019;s fear and anxiety. Simultaneously, the nurse must direct efforts to the safety and comfort of the patient.</p>
