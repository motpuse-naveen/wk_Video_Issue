<h4 class="h4" id="s2341">Human Papillomavirus</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States, affecting 79 million Americans and about 14 million newly acquired infections each year. Most adults who are sexually active will be infected with at least one type of HPV during their lifetime (CDC, 2019b). Most infections are self-limiting and without symptoms, and others can cause cervical and anogenital cancers. Infections can be latent (asymptomatic and detected only by deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] hybridization tests for HPV), subclinical (visualized only after application of acetic acid followed by inspection under magnification), or clinical (visible condylomata acuminata).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2342">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">HPV can be found in lesions of the skin, cervix, vagina, anus, penis, and oral cavity. Of the more than 100 genotypes of HPV that exist, about 40 genotypes affect the anogenital tract (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). Some are low risk in that they are unlikely to cause cancerous changes. These include types 6, 11, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, and 72. The most common strains of HPV, 6 and 11, usually cause <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;condylomata:&lt;/b&gt; warty growths indicative of the human papillomavirus">condylomata</button></strong> (warty growths) that can appear on the vulva, vagina, cervix, and anus. These are often visible or may be palpable by patients. Condylomata are rarely premalignant but are an outward manifestation of the virus (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>). High-risk oncogenic types, including 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, and 52 affect the cervix, causing abnormal cell changes or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dysplasia:&lt;/b&gt; bizarre cell growth resulting in cells that differ in size, shape, or arrangement from other cells of the same tissue type">dysplasia</button></strong> (found on a Papanicolaou [Pap] smear). HPV types 16 and 18 account for 66% of cervical cancer cases, while types 31, 33, 45, and 52 account for another 15% (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 2017a). The incidence of HPV in young women who are sexually active is high. The infection often disappears as the result of an effective immune system response. It is thought that two proteins produced by high-risk types of HPV interfere with tumor suppression by normal cells. Risk factors include being young, being sexually active, having multiple sex partners, and having sex with a partner who has or has had multiple partners. It can be transmitted by other means, however, as it has been found in young girls who have not been sexually active.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2343">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Options for the treatment of external genital warts by a primary provider include topical application of trichloroacetic acid, podophyllin, cryotherapy, as well as surgical removal. Topical agents that can be applied by patients to external lesions include podofilox and imiquimod. Because the safety of podophyllin, imiquimod, and podofilox during pregnancy has not been determined, these agents should not be used during pregnancy. Electrocautery and laser therapy are alternative therapies that may be indicated for patients with a large number or area of genital warts.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment usually eradicates perineal warts or condylomata. However, they may resolve spontaneously without treatment and may also recur even with treatment. Genital warts are more resistant to treatment in patients with diabetes, those who are pregnant, who smoke, or are immunocompromised (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Casanova et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If the treatment includes application of a topical agent by the patient, she needs to be carefully instructed in the use of the agent prescribed and must be able to identify the warts and be able to apply the medication to them. The patient is instructed to anticipate mild pain or local irritation with the use of these agents.</p>
<p class="indent">Women with HPV should have annual Pap smears because of the potential of HPV to cause dysplasia.</p>
<p class="BX18MTXTMFIRST" id="box1681"><img class="m" src="images/377-1.png" alt=""/> For the procedural guidelines for obtaining an optimal Pap smear, go to <a href="http://thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e">thepoint.lww.com/Brunner15e</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Much remains unknown about subclinical and latent HPV disease. Women are often exposed to HPV by partners who are unknowing carriers. The use of condoms can reduce the likelihood of transmission, but transmission can also occur during skin-to-skin contact in areas not covered by condoms.</p>
<p class="indent">In many cases, patients are angry about having warts or HPV and do not know who infected them because the incubation period can be long, and partners may have no symptoms. Acknowledging the emotional distress that occurs when an STI is diagnosed and providing support and facts are important nursing actions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2344">Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The best strategy is prevention of HPV. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the CDC recommends routine vaccination of boys and girls 11 to 12 years of age, before they become sexually active. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years for those who were not previously vaccinated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1682" title="1682"></span>(<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3723">Meites, Szilagyi, Chesson, et al., 2019</a>). The ACIP recommends the 9-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccine for routine vaccinations. In addition to the four noninfectious virus&#x2013;like particles (VLPs) HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 found in 4vHPV, 9vHPV also contains HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 VLPs (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3753">Meites et al., 2019</a>). The vaccination is given in two intramuscular doses, with the initial dose followed by a second dose 6 to 12 months after the first dose. Completion of both doses of the vaccine is important for immunity to develop. If the doses are less than 5 months apart a third dose is required. The vaccination is contraindicated for use in women who are pregnant (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3727">National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although this vaccine is considered an important medical breakthrough with the potential to decrease the impact of HPV-related disease in men and women, it does not replace other strategies important in prevention of HPV. Women still need cervical cancer screening (CDC, 2019b).</p>
