<h4 class="h4" id="s2783">Retinal Detachment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Retinal detachment refers to the separation of the retinal pigment epithelium from the neurosensory layer (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Norris, 2019</a>). The four types of retinal detachment are rhegmatogenous, traction, a combination of rhegmatogenous and traction, and exudative. <em>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment</em> is the most common form (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Liao &#x0026; Zhu, 2019</a>). In this condition, a hole or tear develops in the sensory retina, allowing some of the liquid vitreous to seep through the sensory retina and detach it from the retinal pigment epithelium (see <a href="#ff58-10">Fig. 58-10</a>). People at risk for this type of detachment include those with high myopia or those who have aphakia (absence of the natural lens) after cataract surgery. Trauma may also play a role in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Between 5% and 10% of all rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are associated with proliferative retinopathy&#x2014;a retinopathy associated with diabetic neovascularization (see <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Tension, or a pulling force, is responsible for <em>traction retinal detachment.</em> An ophthalmologist must ascertain all of the areas of retinal break and identify and release the scars or bands of fibrous material providing traction on the retina. In general, patients with this condition have developed fibrous scar tissue from conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, or the retinopathy of prematurity. The hemorrhages and fibrous proliferation associated with these conditions exert a pulling force on the delicate retina.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients can have both rhegmatogenous and traction retinal detachment. <em>Exudative retinal detachments</em> are the result of the production of a serous fluid under the retina from the choroid. Conditions such as uveitis and macular degeneration may cause the production of this serous fluid.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2784">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients may report the sensation of a shade or curtain coming across the vision of one eye, cobwebs, bright flashing lights, or the sudden onset of a great number of floaters. Patients do not complain of pain but retinal detachment is an ocular emergency, requiring immediate surgical intervention for optimal outcomes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2785">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After visual acuity is determined, the patient must have a dilated fundus examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope as well as slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Stereo fundus photography and fluorescein angiography are commonly used during the evaluation.</p>
<p class="indent">Increasingly, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound are used for the complete retinal assessment, especially if the view is obscured by a dense cataract or vitreal hemorrhage. All retinal breaks, all fibrous bands that may be causing traction on the retina, and all degenerative changes must be identified.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2786">Surgical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, an attempt is made to surgically reattach the sensory retina to the retinal pigment epithelium. In traction retinal detachment, the source of traction must be removed and the sensory retina reattached. The most commonly used surgical interventions are the scleral buckle and vitrectomy (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Park, Lee, &#x0026; Lee, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Scleral Buckle</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The retinal surgeon compresses the sclera (often with a scleral buckle [see <a href="#ff58-11">Fig. 58-11</a>] or a silicone band) to indent the scleral wall from the outside of the eye and bring the two retinal layers in contact with each other (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Park et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vitrectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A vitrectomy is an intraocular procedure that allows the introduction of a light source through an incision; a second incision serves as the portal for the vitrectomy instrument. The surgeon dissects preretinal membranes under direct visualization while the retina is stabilized by an intraoperative vitreous substitute.</p>
<p class="indent">Traction on the retina may be relieved through vitrectomy and may be combined with scleral buckling to repair retinal detachments. A gas bubble, silicone oil, or perfluorocarbon and liquids may be injected into the vitreous cavity to help push the sensory retina up against the retinal pigment epithelium.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2787">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management consists of educating the patient and providing supportive care. Postoperative positioning of the patient is critical when a gas bubble is used because the injected bubble must remain in position overlying the area of detachment, providing consistent pressure to reattach the sensory retina. The patient must maintain a prone position that would allow the gas bubble to act as a tamponade for the retinal break (<a href="c58-sec35.xhtml#bib4214">Shaw &#x0026; Lee, 2017</a>). Patients and family members should be made aware of these needs beforehand so that the patient can be made as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">In most cases, vitreoretinal procedures are performed on an outpatient basis, and the patient is seen the next day for a follow-up examination. Postoperative complications may include increased IOP, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and development of cataracts. Patients must be educated about the signs and symptoms of complications, particularly of increasing IOP and postoperative infection. Contact details for the ophthalmic team are provided and the patient is encouraged to call immediately if complications occur.</p>
