<h4 class="h4" id="s3279">Hospital Emergency Preparedness Plans</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Health care facilities are required by the Joint Commission to create a plan for emergency preparedness and to practice this plan with all employees at least twice a year. In general, these plans are developed by the facility&#x2019;s safety/disaster management committee and are overseen by an administrative liaison (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4709">California Hospital Association, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Before the basic emergency operations plan (EOP) can be developed, the planning committee of the health care facility evaluates characteristics of the community to identify the likely types of natural and man-made disasters that might occur. This hazard vulnerability analysis process is the responsibility of the local health care facility and its safety committee, safety officer, or emergency department (ED) manager. This information can be gathered by questioning local law enforcement, fire departments, and emergency medical systems and assessing the patterns of local train traffic, automobile traffic, and flood, earthquake, tornado, or hurricane activity. Consideration is also given to possible MCIs that could arise because of the community&#x2019;s proximity to chemical plants, nuclear facilities, or military bases. Federal, judicial, or financial buildings, schools, and any places where large groups of people gather can be considered high-risk areas (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The emergency preparedness planning committee must have a realistic understanding of its resources. The goal of each health care institution is to remain self-sufficient to provide and sustain core services without the support of external assistance for at least 96 hours from the inception of the incident; ideally, this self-sufficiency should last for 7 days (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). The committee might also outline how staff would triage and assign priority to patients when resources are limited (e.g., when ventilators are in short supply). Multiple factors influence a facility&#x2019;s ability to respond effectively to a sudden influx of patients who are injured or sick, and the committee must anticipate various scenarios to improve its preparedness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3280"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the United States continued to rise at a rapid pace during the early phases of this pandemic, political leaders began to encourage physical distancing among individuals to slow the rate of transmission; this practice became known as social distancing. The goal of social distancing was to attempt to flatten the curve of new infections, thereby avoiding a surge of demand on the health care system. However, the effects of social distancing were not enough to decrease the burden experienced by many U.S. hospitals in key geographic areas, such as New York City and New Orleans. Hospitals in these areas reported shortages of key equipment needed to care for patients who were critically ill, including ventilators and PPE for medical staff (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Ranney, Griffeth, &#x0026; Jha, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Insufficient PPE (e.g., respirators, face shields, gowns, hand and equipment sanitizer) for frontline health care workers resulted not only in exposures to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but also in the deaths of health care workers from COVID-19. In response to these shortages, health care providers made pleas to government officials to try to secure adequate PPE for their frontline workers (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4728">Ranney et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary declared the EUA of respiratory protective devices, which authorized the use of additional respiratory protective devices. During this time, the FDA provided frequent updates to manufacturers, facilities, and local and state jurisdictions to increase the production of respirators and additional PPE (CDC, 2020a).</p>
<p class="indent">On April 8, 2020, the FEMA COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force developed a four-step plan to preserve critical resources for medical use. The four steps included preservation, acceleration, expansion, and allocation (FEMA, 2020b). The shortage of critical medical supplies became a global crisis. In the United States, the Defense Production Act (DPA) allowed the president to direct private companies to produce equipment needed for a national emergency. A crucial role for the government is to coordinate efforts to ensure that areas that have been impacted the most are receiving needed equipment and supplies. As U.S. health care facilities continued to care for the growing number of patients hospitalized and critically ill with COVID-19, government officials worked to secure essential equipment needed to care for patients and ensure the safety of their workforce (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4728">Ranney et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3281">Components of the Emergency Operations Plan</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The principles of emergency management must be a part of the EOP design and include a comprehensive plan for tackling all potential and actual hazards. The main goal is the protection of the community. The EOP should be integrated with local, state, and federal government plans and coordinated with the private sector and volunteers. It must be coordinated in advance to achieve a single common purpose; yet the plan must be flexible enough to adapt to any potential disaster. Essential components of the EOP include the following (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4709">California Hospital Association, 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Activation response:</em> The EOP activation response of a health care facility defines where, how, and when the response is initiated.</span></li>
<li><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2222" title="2222"></span><em>Internal/external communication plan:</em> Communication is critical for all parties involved, including communication to and from the prehospital arena.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Plan for coordinated patient care:</em> A response is planned for organized patient care into and out of the facility, including transfers from within the hospital to other facilities. The site of the disaster can determine where the greater number of patients may self-refer.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Security plans:</em> A coordinated security plan involving facility and community agencies is key to the control of an otherwise chaotic situation.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Identification of external resources:</em> Resources outside the facility are identified, including local, state, and federal resources and information about how to activate these resources.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Plan for people management and traffic flow:</em> &#x201C;People management&#x201D; includes strategies to manage the patients, the public, the media, and the personnel. Specific areas are assigned, and a designated person is delegated to manage each of these groups.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Data management strategy:</em> A data management plan for every aspect of the disaster will save time at every step. A backup system for documenting, tracking, and staffing is developed if the facility utilizes an electronic health record.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Demobilization response:</em> Deactivation of the response is as important as activation; resources should not be unnecessarily exhausted. The person who decides when the facility resumes daily activities is clearly identified. Any possible residual effects of a disaster must be considered before this decision is made.</span></li>
<li><span><em>After action report or corrective plan:</em> Facilities often see increased volumes of patients 3 months or more after an incident. Postincident response must include a critique and a debriefing for all parties involved, immediately and again at a later date.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Plan for practice drills:</em> Practice drills that include community participation allow for troubleshooting any issues before a real-life incident occurs.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Anticipated resources:</em> Food and water must be available for staff, families, and others who may be at the facility for an extended period.</span></li>
<li><span><em>MCI planning:</em> MCI planning includes such issues as planning for mass fatalities and morgue readiness.</span></li>
<li><span><em>Education plan for all of the above:</em> A strong education plan for all personnel regarding each step of the plan allows for improved readiness and additional input for fine-tuning the EOP.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">As noted previously, hospitals are required to periodically hold disaster drills. Results from these drills can identify flaws within the EOP as well as unanticipated needs prior to any real disaster situation. Evidence indicates that full-scale regional exercises that coordinate responses from both hospitals and emergency medical services (EMS) are the most effective drills because they clearly identify breakdowns in communication (FEMA, 2019).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3282">Initiating the Emergency Operations Plan</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Notification of a disaster situation to a health care facility varies with each situation. In general, the notification to the facility comes from outside sources unless the initial incident occurred at the facility. The disaster activation plan should clearly state how the EOP is to be initiated. If communication is functioning, field incident command will give notice of the approximate number of patients who are arriving, although the number of patients who are self-referring will not be known (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4702">Tintinalli, Ma, Yealy, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC provided evidence-based guidance for maintaining the EOP for all health care facilities, which provided guidance for staff, patients, and visitors. The guidelines were developed to minimize the spread of the virus within the community and to ensure all hospital staff were trained, equipped, and capable of executing these mitigation practices (CDC, 2020b).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Identifying Patients and Documenting Patient Information</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient tracking is a critical component of casualty management. Disaster tags, which are numbered and include triage priority, name, address, age, location and description of injuries, and treatments or medications given, are used to communicate patient information. The tag should be securely placed on the patient and remain with the patient at all times. The tag number and the patient&#x2019;s name, if known, are recorded in a disaster log. The log is used by the command center to track patients, assign beds, and provide families with information.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Triage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Triage is the sorting of patients to determine the priority of their health care needs and the proper site for treatment. In nondisaster situations, health care workers assign a high priority and allocate the most resources to those who are the most critically ill (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>). For example, under ordinary circumstances, a young adult who has a chest injury and is in cardiac arrest would receive advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including medications, chest tubes, intravenous (IV) fluids, blood, and possibly emergency surgery in an effort to restore life. However, in a disaster, when health care providers are faced with a large number of casualties, the fundamental principle guiding resource allocation is to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Decisions are based on the likelihood of survival and consumption of available resources. Therefore, this same patient, and others with conditions associated with a high mortality rate, will be assigned as a low triage priority in a disaster situation, even if the person is conscious. Although this may sound uncaring, from an ethical standpoint the expenditure of limited resources on people with a low chance of survival, and denial of those resources to others with serious but treatable conditions, cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="indent">The triage officer rapidly assesses those injured at the disaster scene. Patients are immediately tagged and transported or given lifesaving interventions. One person performs the initial triage while other EMS personnel perform immediate lifesaving measures (e.g., intubation) and transport patients. Although EMS personnel carry out initial field triage, secondary and continuous triage at all subsequent levels of care is essential (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4702">Tintinalli et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">It is important that an experienced ED provider is positioned at the entrance to provide primary triage at the acute care facility. Traffic control within the facility is one of the most important components of managing the disaster and resources (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). The triage area may be outside the entry or just at the door of the ED. This facilitates the triage of all patients&#x2014;those arriving by medical transport and those who walk into the ED. Some patients who have already been seen in the field may be reclassified in the triage area based on their current presentation.</p>
<p class="indent">Triage categories separate patients according to the severity of injury. A common triage method is the use of a special color-coded tagging system so that the triage category is immediately obvious. This system consists of four colors: red, yellow, green, and black. Each color signifies a different level of priority. <a href="#tt68-2">Table 68-2</a> describes each category and gives examples of how different injuries would be classified (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>). Alternative triage systems exclusively for MCI have also been designed. One triage system that has gained support in the United States and is used for mass casualty transport is the SALT (<em>S</em>ort, <em>A</em>ssess, <em>L</em>ifesaving interventions, <em>T</em>reatment/<em>T</em>ransport) system. It instructs the providers to quickly &#x201C;<em>S</em>ort&#x201D; casualties by assessing a patient&#x2019;s ability to follow commands, then to individually &#x201C;<em>A</em>ssess&#x201D; casualties to rapidly apply &#x201C;<em>L</em>ifesaving interventions,&#x201D; and assign a priority for &#x201C;<em>T</em>reatment and/or <em>T</em>ransport.&#x201D; SALT triage was developed to allow for rapid evaluation and sorting of patients of any age, injured in any type of event (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Internal Problems</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The American Red Cross has developed a basic survival/shelter resource kit; however, each facility must determine its supply lists based on its own needs assessment. The EOP committee should determine the top 10 critical medications used during normal day-to-day operations and then anticipate which other medications may be required in a disaster or in an MCI. For example, the health care facility might plan to have available a stockpile of antidotes (e.g., cyanide kits) or antibiotics used in treating biologic agents. Information should be available about stocking or restocking any of the basic and special supplies, how those supplies are requested, and the time required to receive those supplies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Communicating with the Media and Family</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Communication is a key component of disaster management. Communication within the vast team of disaster responders is paramount; however, effective, informative communication with the media and worried family members is also crucial.</p>
<p class="h7">Managing Media Requests for Information</p>
<p class="nonindent">Although the media have an obligation to report the news and can play a positive role in communication, reporters and newscasters and their support teams can compromise operations and patient confidentiality. The disaster plan should include a clearly defined process for managing all media requests, including social media, and include a designated spokesperson, the public information officer, a site for the dissemination of information (away from patient care areas), and a regular schedule for providing updates.</p>
<p class="indent">The EOP helps prevent the release of contradictory or inaccurate information. Initial statements should focus on current efforts and what is being done to better understand the scope and impact of the situation. Information about casualties should not be released. Security staff should not allow media personnel access to patient care areas. However, media resources may be mobilized to notify the general population when disease containment is needed in case of an epidemic or the potential for one, including the location of shelters, necessity of quarantines, and point of dispensing units in the case of bioterrorism (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Caring for Families</p>
<p class="nonindent">Friends and family members converging on the scene must be cared for by the facility. The public information officer&#x2019;s role is to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2224" title="2224"></span>provide direction for the families and provide them with information as it becomes available. They may be feeling intense anxiety, shock, or grief and should be provided with information and updates about their loved ones as soon as possible and regularly thereafter. They should not be in the triage or treatment areas but in a designated area staffed by available social workers, counselors, therapists, or clergy. Access to this area should be controlled to prevent families from being disturbed. Information regarding loved ones can also be obtained at this time, which assists in identification of both the injured and the deceased.</p>
<p class="indent">There may be times during a disaster situation such as an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic that health care facilities must restrict visitation or access to the hospital. Health care organizations and nurses who typically pride themselves on providing patient- and family-centered care may be forced to prohibit visitors from accompanying loved ones to the hospital in order to reduce the spread of a virus or other infectious diseases which could be potentially fatal to visitors who are living with chronic health conditions. The health care team, which may be organized by the nurse, is responsible for developing a clear communication plan that designates a primary point of contact and eliminates barriers to communication (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4721">Hart, Turnbull, Oppenheim, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). To keep families informed and encourage interactions among patients and their support network, hospitals have relied heavily on using technology during these disaster situations (e.g., FaceTime&#x2122;, Google Hangouts&#x2122;, Skype&#x2122;, Zoom&#x2122;). Some patients and their families may come from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and not have access to computer systems and associated software that can facilitate remote conversations. An adequate plan addresses the needs of families who may be socioeconomically disadvantaged and puts into effect plans that can meet their needs (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4721">Hart et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many U.S. hospitals restricted visitors and family members from entering the hospitals for the health and safety of visitors, patients, and employees. The CDC provided strict visitation guidelines for health care facilities in order to reduce the risk of transmission and combat the lack of PPE. Many hospitals restricted visitors in all inpatient locations, behavioral health units, EDs, and ambulatory procedure units. Many elective procedures were cancelled (see <a href="c52.xhtml">Chapter 52</a>, <a href="c52-sec13.xhtml#ct52-4">Chart 52-4</a>). One support person was permitted to be with the obstetric patient during labor, delivery, and postpartum care. When possible, the identified support person was to remain with the patient for the duration of the admission. Temporary visitation may have been granted for patients in extenuating circumstances (e.g., imminent death), or for specific populations who required extra support, including patients with developmental disability or cognitive impairment. Facilities were encouraged to identify alternative methods for patients and families to communicate and interact, including the use of technology as described previously (CDC, 2020c).</p>
<p class="indent">Chart 68-1 discusses cultural variables to consider when coping with disaster-related injuries and death.</p>
<h6 class="h6">The Nurse&#x2019;s Role in Disaster Response Plans</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses make up the largest component of the health care workforce across the globe (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). The role of the nurse during a disaster varies. Nurses may be asked to perform duties outside their areas of expertise and may take on responsibilities normally held by physicians or advanced practice nurses. For example, a critical care nurse may intubate a patient or even insert a chest tube. A nurse may perform wound d&#x00E9;bridement or suturing. A nurse may serve as the triage officer. In these situations, it is imperative that nurses strive to maximize patient safety and be aware of state regulations related to nursing practice (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4705">American Nurses Association [ANA], 2017</a>; <a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Casey, 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="box1a">
<p class="BoxpNumber" id="ct68-1"><strong>Chart 68-1</strong></p></div>
<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Cultural Considerations</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Any disaster or mass casualty incident can be expected to involve members of diverse religious, ethnic, and cultural groups or may be targeted at and predominately affect a specific religious or ethnic group. Health care providers likewise include members of all religious, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds and should bear in mind that victims may have needs relating to the following:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Family roles and extended family importance</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Language difficulties that increase fears and frustrations</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Privacy</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Rituals about handling the dead</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Specific religious practices related to medical treatment, hygiene, or diet</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Specific places/times for prayer</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Timing of funeral services</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Travel and visa restrictions limiting access to one&#x2019;s country of origin, family, work, or educational opportunities.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Some religious communities have plans for emergencies and disasters, and local hospitals should integrate these plans to the extent possible into their emergency operations plans.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Although the exact role of a nurse in disaster management depends on the specific needs of the facility at the time, it should be clear which nurse or physician is in charge of a given patient care area and which procedures each individual nurse may or may not perform. Assistance can be obtained through the HICS, and nonmedical personnel can provide services where possible. Nurses may be asked to delegate care to others, including students, staff assisting from other institutions, or volunteers. This process requires the nurse to rapidly assess the skills of those who are available to assist in patient care. Nurses must continue to emphasize patient safety and delegate appropriately. As the availability of coworkers, clinical experts, or support services may be limited, nurses may need to rely more upon their own competence or the collective competence of a new team (ANA, 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">During a disaster, nurses may feel a tension between maintaining traditional patient-centered approaches to care, which aim to achieve the maximum good for individual patients, and the need for public-focused approaches, which prioritize fair resource allocation during crisis conditions. A public health approach to ethics can provide nurses guidance in balancing this tension. &#x201C;Public health emergencies require clinicians to change their practice, including in some situations, acting to prioritize the community above the individual in fairly allocating scarce resources&#x201D; (Berlinger, Wynia, Powell, et&#x00A0;al., 2020, p. 1). Nurses should remember that nursing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2225" title="2225"></span>care in a disaster focuses on essential care from a perspective of what is best for all patients (see <a href="#ct68-2">Chart 68-2</a>). In addition, acquiring knowledge of the hospital disaster plan, participating in drills, and honing competencies related to disaster management are essential (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Casey, 2017</a>). Nurse leaders and administrators should be cognizant of potential security issues and assess and plan for surge capacity capability and inhouse resources such as water, supplies, pharmaceuticals, and generator power. They also should predetermine means to evacuate the hospital if necessary, including identifying an ultimate destination or destinations. The hospital must plan for shortages of all kinds&#x2014;staff, medications, water/food, and equipment (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">New settings and atypical roles for nurses arise during a disaster&#x2014;for example, the nurse may provide shelter care in a temporary housing area or bereavement support and assistance with identification of deceased loved ones. People may require crisis intervention, or the nurse may participate in counseling other staff members and in critical incident stress management (CISM). Special care may be warranted for at-risk populations during a disaster (see <a href="#ct68-3">Chart 68-3</a>).</p>

<div class="box4"><p class="Box4pTitle"><strong><strong>Who Receives a Mechanical Ventilator When They Are Scarce Commodities During a Pandemic?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">You are a staff nurse who works in an emergency department (ED) in a university-affiliated hospital. Your community is in the midst of a surge of positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and all ICU beds are filled with patients with COVID-19. For the past 12 hours, there have been no mechanical ventilators available for patients who are admitted and who are in severe respiratory distress until a patient who is intubated dies in the ICU, freeing up a ventilator. Currently, there are two patients waiting in the ED who would be intubated and mechanically ventilated if ventilators were available. Both patients have no significant medical or surgical history, are of normal weight, are nonsmokers, and take no prescription medications. One of these patients is T.C., a 55-year-old woman who is a cashier at a supermarket. The other patient is E.W., a 22-year-old female nursing student. Since both T.C. and E.W. are considered to be equivalent in terms of purported benefits of mechanical ventilation, the hospital&#x2019;s predetermined randomization protocol is implemented to determine who receives the ventilator. T.C. is selected to receive ventilatory support. As E.W.&#x2019;s primary nurse, you question why T.C. is selected over E.W. and wonder if E.W.&#x2019;s younger age and presumably longer lifespan and her chosen field of work as a future nurse should have given her preferential advantages over T.C. in receiving ventilatory support.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">During times of crises with scarcity of critical resources, protocols must be devised to assure that scarce resources are allocated in a fair and just manner. Most hospitals in the United States devised such contingency protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These protocols were devised to maximize potential benefits to society and ensure fair and equitable access to needed resources. In order to ensure fairness, patients eligible to receive resources may not face discrimination because of ethnic origin or race, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender, or age.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="Box4BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Describe the ethical principles that are in conflict in this case (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="c01-sec05.xhtml#ct1-7">Chart 1-7</a>). Patient autonomy is typically the preeminent ethical principle in all but crises situations. How can you ensure that E.W.&#x2019;s dignity may be preserved despite these trying circumstances? Presumably, E.W.&#x2019;s age can mean that she has more years of life ahead of her than T.C. Should this give her an advantage over T.C.? Should purported benefits to therapy be quantified by projecting years of productive life?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Frontline health care workers are triaged to receive some benefits before others during pandemics (e.g., priority for vaccinations). E.W. is not a frontline worker. However, she is a nursing student and could be a future frontline worker. There are some who may argue that while E.W. could be a future frontline worker, that T.C., as a supermarket cashier, is already functioning as an essential worker. Should either one of them be given preferential consideration for receiving ventilatory support due to their current or potential designation as frontline workers? Why or why not?</p>
<p class="Box4BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>What resources may be available to assist you in reconciling this distressing rationing situation in your ED? How can you ensure that just and fair decisions are being made for your patients and for the people you serve within your community?</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Caring for People with Disability During a Disaster</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">When a disaster occurs, the multiple agencies involved attempt to provide food, water, and shelter to all those affected. People with disability have specific needs that require attention. It is recommended that people with disability have a personal support network to check on them after a disaster and to provide needed assistance. They should also have a backup system and an evacuation plan. Agencies need to be aware that service animals are also affected during a disaster and may be brought to shelters with their companions.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Evacuation assistance is imperative for people with disability. Directions to personal equipment (e.g., communication aids, medications, oxygen) should be available to rescue personnel. In a rapid evacuation, mobility devices, oxygen, suction, and medications will be needed at the shelters. Special efforts to keep those with vision or hearing impairment informed should be implemented. People skilled in sign language are also valuable resources during a disaster. The American Red Cross and the National Organization on Disability provide information on their websites for disaster preparedness for people with disability (see the Resources section).</p>

<p class="h7">Considering Ethical Conflicts</p>
<p class="nonindent">Disasters can present a disparity between the resources of the health care agency and the needs of those affected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2226" title="2226"></span>by the disaster (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4724">Leider, DeBruin, Reynolds, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). This generates ethical dilemmas for nurses and other health care providers. Issues include conflicts related to the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Assisted suicide</span></li>
<li><span>Confidentiality</span></li>
<li><span>Consent</span></li>
<li><span>Duty</span></li>
<li><span>Futile therapy</span></li>
<li><span>Rationing care</span></li>
<li><span>Resuscitation</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Nurses may find it difficult to not provide care to the dying or to withhold information to avoid spreading fear and panic. Clinical scenarios that are unimaginable in normal circumstances confront the nurse in extreme instances. Other ethical dilemmas may arise out of health care providers&#x2019; instincts for self-protection and protection of their families.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses can plan for the ethical dilemmas they will face during disasters by establishing a framework for evaluating ethical questions before they arise and by identifying and exploring possible responses to difficult clinical situations. They can consider how the fundamental ethical principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and distributive justice will influence their decisions and care in disaster response (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Ram-Tiktin, 2017</a>) (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>).</p>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon28.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</p>
<p class="nonindent">The COVID-19 crisis has created unprecedented challenges and ethical issues for frontline health care professionals, including insufficient supplies of PPE, shortages of lifesaving equipment, compromised standards of care, and conflicts between professional duties and personal health and safety concerns. As a result, many nurses and other health care providers have been at risk for or experienced moral distress (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Altman, 2020</a>). Examples of ethical issues related to COVID-19 included:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Strictly limited hospital visitation policies that hampered nurses from involving families in care decisions</span></li>
<li><span>Isolation measures that resulted in patients dying without family physically present</span></li>
<li><span>Dire situations in which patients could have been denied potentially lifesaving therapies due to shortages and triaged care</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">The Code of Ethics for Nurses highlights the importance of providing safe, quality patient care. However, nurses also have an obligation to self-care and to providing support to their own families. Nurses may worry that they will cause harm to a loved one and struggle with how to balance their professional responsibilities with their personal commitments (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4722">Johns Hopkins University [JHU], 2020</a>). These equally important obligations contribute to conflicts during pandemics when nurses must care for critically ill infectious patients, often under extreme circumstances that may include an insufficiency and inadequacy of resources and uncontained contagion. During pandemics, nurses must decide how much care they can provide to others while also taking care of themselves. They must be supported in these crucial decisions by the systems in which they provide care and by society (ANA, 2020). Nurses may struggle with the call to volunteer and respond in a pandemic. According to a policy statement drafted by the ANA (2020) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses may choose not to respond for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Being a member of a vulnerable group</span></li>
<li><span>Safety concerns related to a lack of PPE or inadequate testing</span></li>
<li><span>Inadequate support to meet personal or family needs</span></li>
<li><span>Concerns regarding professional and legal protection for providing nursing care</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Organizational support for the nurse must be assured. Nurses must continue to advocate for systems and protocols that protect their ethical obligations as nurses, as well as ensure equity and fairness to all concerned in times of pandemics (ANA, 2020) (see Ethical Dilemmas in <a href="#ct68-2">Chart 68-2</a>, and in <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c19-sec04.xhtml#ct19-7">Chart 19-7</a>, and <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>, <a href="c48-sec11.xhtml#ct48-9">Chart 48-9</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Managing Behavioral Issues</p>
<p class="nonindent">Disasters by nature are stressful and life-changing experiences which may cause adverse psychological effects, social disruption, and increased risks for vulnerable populations, including violence and abuse (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4730">Sloand, Killion, Yarandi, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Although most individuals function well during a disaster, both people and communities suffer immediate and sometimes long-term psychological trauma that most often relates to fear and anxiety (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). Common responses to disaster include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Anxiety</span></li>
<li><span>Compassion fatigue</span></li>
<li><span>Depression</span></li>
<li><span>Impaired performance</span></li>
<li><span>Interpersonal conflicts</span></li>
<li><span>Posttraumatic stress disorder</span></li>
<li><span>Somatization (fatigue, general malaise, headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rashes)</span></li>
<li><span>Substance use disorder (SUD)</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Factors that influence a person&#x2019;s response to disaster include the degree and nature of the exposure to the disaster; loss of friends, family members, and pets; existing coping strategies; available resources and support; and the personal meaning attached to the event. Other factors, such as loss of home and valued possessions, extended exposure to danger, and exposure to toxic contamination, also influence response and increase the risk of adjustment problems. Those exposed to the dead and injured, those endangered by the event, older adults, children, emergency first responders, and health care personnel caring for victims are considered to be at higher risk for emotional sequelae. A person&#x2019;s normal response to stress and bereavement will also affect their response after a disaster (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4700">Emergency Nurses Association [ENA], 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses can assist victims of disaster through active listening and providing emotional support, giving information, and referring patients to therapists or social workers. Experience has shown that few victims of disaster seek these services, and early intervention minimizes psychological consequences. Nurses can also discourage victims from subjecting themselves to repeated exposure to the event through media replays and news articles, as well as encourage them to return to normal activities and social roles when appropriate (ENA, 2020).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Critical Incident Stress Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">CISM is an approach to preventing and treating the emotional trauma that can affect emergency responders as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2227" title="2227"></span>a consequence of their jobs and that can also occur to anyone involved in a disaster or MCI. CISM is handled by teams, which are available to the OEM. There are 350 such teams in the United States. All branches of emergency services have CISM teams, as do the military and civilian industries (e.g., airline industry).</p>
<p class="indent">Components of a management plan include education (preparedness) before an incident occurs about critical incident stress and coping strategies; field support (ensuring that staff get adequate rest, food, and fluids, and rotating workloads) during an incident; and defusings, debriefings, demobilization, supportive services to the family and follow-up care after the incident (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4723">Kalanlar, 2019</a>; <a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>) (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a> for further discussion on CISM).</p>
