<h4 class="h4a" id="s2586"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1816" title="1816"></span>SKIN CARE</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Some skin problems are markedly aggravated by soap and water; therefore, bathing routines are modified according to the condition. Denuded skin, whether the area of desquamation is large or small, is excessively prone to damage by chemicals, trauma, and even bathing. Friction occurs when skin rubs against another surface, which may happen when the skin is vigorously dried with a towel, resulting in damage to the epidermal and upper dermal skin layers (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2587">Protecting the Skin</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of routine skin care should be to maintain the acidic pH of the skin; therefore, alkaline soaps should be avoided. No-rinse, pH-balanced soap is the best. Moisturizing products, such as emollients and humectants, can be applied to help maintain skin moisture. Emollients moisturize and soften the skin; conversely, humectants attract water to moisturize skin with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;xerosis:&lt;/b&gt; overly dry, rough skin">xerosis</button></strong> (very dry, rough skin) (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Basic skin care in bathing a patient with a skin disorder is as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>A mild, lipid-free soap or soap substitute is used (e.g., Dove sensitive skin&#x2122;, Cetaphil&#x2122;, CeraVe&#x2122;, VANICREAM&#x2122;).</li>
<li>The area is rinsed completely and blotted dry with a soft cloth.</li>
<li>Deodorant soaps are avoided.</li>
<li>Laundry detergents and fabric softener free of fragrance are used.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Special care is necessary when changing dressings. Sterile saline, or another prescribed solution, helps loosen crusts, remove exudates, or free an adherent dry dressing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2588">Preventing Secondary Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Skin lesions should be regarded as potentially infectious, and proper safety precautions should be observed until the diagnosis is established. Most lesions with purulent drainage contain infectious material. The nurse and primary provider must adhere to standard precautions and wear gloves when inspecting the skin or changing a dressing. The use of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper disposal of any contaminated dressing is carried out according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations (OSHA, 2011).</p>

<p class="nonindent">Dressings can be categorized in several ways. An overview of select types of dressings and their indications is provided; however, this is not an exhaustive list of dressing types.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Passive dressings</em> have only a protective function and maintain a moist environment for natural healing. They include those that just cover the area (e.g., DuoDERM&#x2122;, Tegaderm&#x2122;) and may remain in place for several days. <em>Interactive dressings</em> are capable of absorbing wound exudate while maintaining a moist environment in the area of the wound and allowing the surrounding skin to remain dry. They include hydrocolloids, alginates, and hydrogels. It is thought that interactive dressings are able to modify the physiology of the wound environment by modulating and stimulating cellular activity and by releasing growth factors (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dabiri, Damstetter, &#x0026; Phillips, 2016</a>). <em>Active dressings</em> improve the healing process and decrease the healing time. They include skin grafts and biologic skin substitutes. Both interactive and active dressings create a moist environment at the interface of the wound with the dressing.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Wicker dressings</em> are ropelike dressings used to manage sinus tracts or wounds that have undermining (see later discussion of sinus tracts and undermining in Pressure Injuries). These are effective at absorbing drainage. Wicker dressings can be plain or antimicrobial. <em>Filler dressings</em> are best for deeper wounds; these fill the contour of the wound, allowing the wound to heal by secondary intention. <em>Cover dressings</em> are appropriate for surface wounds and also can be used as a secondary dressing over filler dressings. These dressings can be absorptive or hydrating, plain or antimicrobial (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because so many wound care products are available, it is often difficult to select the most appropriate product for a specific wound. Selection of products should be made carefully because of their expense. Both clinical efficacy and health-related outcomes (e.g., decreased pain, increased mobility) should be used to measure the success of a wound care product. Even with the availability of a large variety of dressings, an appropriate selection can be made if certain principles are maintained. These principles are referred to as the five rules of wound care (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dabiri et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="NL1First56"><span class="numah">1.</span><em>Rule 1: Categorization.</em> The nurse learns about dressings by generic category and compares new products with those that already make up the category. The nurse becomes familiar with indications, contraindications, and side effects. The best dressing may be created by combining products in different categories to achieve several goals at the same time. These categories are discussed in subsequent sections.</p>
<p class="NL1Middle56"><span class="numah">2.</span><em>Rule 2: Selection.</em> The nurse selects the safest and most effective, easy-to-use, and cost-effective dressing possible. Nurses follow the primary provider&#x2019;s prescriptions for dressings. They must be prepared to give the primary provider feedback about the dressing&#x2019;s effect on the wound, ease of use for the patient, and other considerations when applicable.</p>
<p class="NL1Middle56"><span class="numah">3.</span><em>Rule 3: Change.</em> The nurse changes dressings based on patient, wound, and dressing assessments, not on standardized routines.</p>
<p class="NL1Middle56"><span class="numah">4.</span><em>Rule 4: Evolution.</em> As the wound progresses through the phases of wound healing, the dressing protocol is altered to optimize healing. It is rare, especially in cases of chronic wounds, that the same dressing material is appropriate throughout the healing process. The nurse educates the patient or family caregiver about wound care and ensures that the family has access to appropriate dressing choices.</p>
<p class="NL1Last56"><span class="numah">5.</span><em>Rule 5: Practice.</em> Practice with dressing material is required for the nurse to learn the performance parameters of the particular dressing. Refining the skills of applying appropriate dressings correctly and learning about new dressing products are essential nursing responsibilities. Dressing changes should not be delegated to unlicensed personnel; these techniques require the knowledge base and assessment skills of professional nurses.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2590">Autolytic D&#x00E9;bridement</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Autolytic <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;d&#x00E9;bridement:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of contaminated and devitalized tissues and foreign material">d&#x00E9;bridement</button></strong> is a process that uses the body&#x2019;s own digestive enzymes to break down necrotic tissue. The wound is kept moist with occlusive dressings. Eschar and necrotic debris are softened, liquefied, and separated from the bed of the wound.</p>
<p class="indent">Several commercially available products mirror the enzymes that the body produces naturally and are referred to as enzymatic d&#x00E9;briding agents; an example is collagenase. Application of these products speeds the rate at which necrotic tissue is removed. This method, although slower than surgical d&#x00E9;bridement, is more discriminating for tissue removal and does not damage healthy tissue surrounding the wound. When enzymatic d&#x00E9;bridement is being used under an occlusive dressing, a foul odor and exudate is produced by the breakdown of cellular debris. This odor does not indicate that the wound is infected. The nurse should expect this reaction and help the patient and family understand the reason for the odor. Silver and iodine inactivate collagenase and therefore should not be used with it. Application of collagenase should be nickel thick and changed daily to be effective (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2591">Categories of Dressings</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><a href="#tt56-1">Table 56-1</a> provides a guide to the functions and actions of wound dressings.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Occlusive Dressings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Occlusive dressings may be commercially produced or made inexpensively from sterile or nonsterile gauze squares or wrap. Occlusive dressings cover topical medication that is applied to a skin lesion. The area is kept airtight by using plastic film (e.g., plastic wrap). Plastic film is thin and readily adapts to all sizes, body shapes, and skin surfaces. In general, plastic wrap should be used no more than 12 hours each day. Plastic surgical tape containing a corticosteroid in the adhesive layer can be cut to size and applied to individual lesions. Occlusive dressings are often used to cover surgical incisions for the first 48 hours postoperatively (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Moisture-Retentive Dressings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Commercially produced moisture-retentive dressings are efficient at removing exudate because of their higher moisture&#x2013;vapor transmission rate; some have reservoirs that can hold <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1818" title="1818"></span>excessive exudate. A number of moisture-retentive dressings are already impregnated with saline solution, petrolatum, zinc-saline solution, hydrogel, or antimicrobial agents, thereby eliminating the need to coat the skin to avoid maceration. The main advantages of moisture-retentive dressings are improved fibrinolysis, accelerated epidermal resurfacing, reduced pain, fewer infections, less scar tissue, gentle autolytic d&#x00E9;bridement, and decreased frequency of dressing changes. Depending on the product used and the type of dermatologic conditions encountered, most moisture-retentive dressings may remain in place from 12 to 24 hours; some can remain in place as long as 3 days (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Doughty &#x0026; McNichol, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hydrogels</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hydrogels are polymers with 90% to 95% water content. They are available in impregnated sheets or as gels. Hydrogels provide moisture to maintain a moist wound bed to promote healing. Their high moisture content makes them ideal for autolytic d&#x00E9;bridement of wounds. They are semitransparent, allowing for wound inspection without dressing removal. They are comfortable and soothing for the painful wound. They require a secondary dressing to keep them in place. Hydrogels are appropriate for partial- and full-thickness, dry to light exudative wounds such as necrotic wounds, minor burns, and radiation burns (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Hydrocolloids</p>
<p class="nonindent">Hydrocolloids are composed of a water-impermeable, polyurethane outer covering separated from the wound by a hydrocolloid material. They are adherent and nonpermeable to water vapor and oxygen. As water evaporates over the wound, it is absorbed into the dressing, which softens and discolors with the increased water content. Hydrocolloids promote autolysis, reduce the risk for infection and pain, protect the wound, and promote healing (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>). The dressing can be removed without causing damage to the wound. As the dressing absorbs water, it produces a foul-smelling, yellowish covering over the wound. This is a normal chemical interaction between the dressing and wound exudate and should not be confused with purulent drainage from the wound. Unfortunately, most of the hydrocolloid dressings are opaque, preventing inspection of the wound without removal of the dressing.</p>
<p class="indent">Available in sheets and in gels, hydrocolloids are a good choice for both partial- and full-thickness wounds, with light to moderate exudate. They are not recommended for infected wounds and are used cautiously in patients with diabetes (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>). Easy-to-use and comfortable hydrocolloid dressings promote d&#x00E9;bridement and formation of granulation tissue. Most are changed every 3 to 5 days and most can be submerged in water for bathing or showering.</p>
<p class="h7">Foam Dressings</p>
<p class="nonindent">Foam dressings consist of microporous polyurethane with an absorptive <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hydrophilic:&lt;/b&gt; a substance or medication that is readily absorbed in aqueous solution">hydrophilic</button></strong> (water-absorbing) surface that covers the wound and a <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hydrophobic:&lt;/b&gt; a material that repels moisture">hydrophobic</button></strong> (water-resistant) backing to block leakage of exudate. They are nonadherent; most are designed so that they require a secondary dressing to keep them in place. Adhesive borders are available on some foam dressings, negating the need for a second dressing.</p>
<p class="indent">Moisture is absorbed into the foam layer, decreasing maceration of the surrounding tissue. A moist environment is maintained, and removal of the dressing does not damage the wound. The foams are opaque and must be removed for wound inspection. Foams are a good choice for partial- and full-thickness, moderate to heavy exudative wounds. They are especially helpful over bony prominences because they provide contoured cushioning (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Calcium Alginates</p>
<p class="nonindent">Calcium alginates are derived from algae or kelp polysaccharides and consist of very absorbent calcium alginate fibers (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Dabiri et al., 2016</a>). They are hemostatic and bioabsorbable and can be used as sheets or mats of absorbent material. As the exudate is absorbed, the fibers turn into a viscous hydrogel. They are useful in areas where the tissue is more irritated or macerated. The alginate dressing forms a moist pocket over the wound while the surrounding skin stays dry. The dressing also reacts with wound fluid, which forms a foul-smelling coating. Alginates work well when packed into a deep cavity, wound, or sinus tract with heavy drainage. They are nonadherent and require a secondary dressing. Alginates are used for moderate to highly exudative full-thickness wounds, such as pressure injuries, infected wounds, and venous insufficiency ulcers (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>). Wound experts suggest that alginates are superior to other modern dressings for d&#x00E9;briding necrotic wounds (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antimicrobials</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Antimicrobial dressings contain antiseptics, cadexomer iodine, honey, hydrofera blue, mupirocin, or silver to reduce the risk of infection. They are available in many different types of dressings, such as gauze, foams, films, or absorptive or nonadherent materials. Antimicrobial dressings are indicated for partial- or full-thickness wounds that have a risk for infection, such as surgical wounds (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Collagens</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Collagen dressings are protein based and derived from animal sources (bovine, equine, porcine, or avian) that promote wound healing. Collagens are used for partial- or full-thickness noninfected wounds with light to moderate drainage, such as pressure injuries, vascular ulcers, skin donor sites, surgical wounds, diabetic ulcerations, and traumatic wounds (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Composites</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Composite dressings combine components from several dressing types into a single dressing that is absorptive and that provide protection from bacteria and fluids (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Contact Layers</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Contact layers are thin, nonadherent, conforming dressings that are directly applied to wounds for protection. They are porous, thus allowing exudate to drain through to a secondary dressing. Contact layers are appropriate for partial- and full-thickness wounds, infected wounds, skin donor sites, and split-thickness skin grafts (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Transparent Film Dressings</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Transparent film dressings are polymer membranes, permeable to moisture vapors and oxygen, but impermeable to water, liquids, and bacteria. Transparency allows for direct visualization of the wound. The purposes of films are to protect, provide a moist wound bed environment, promote autolysis, and lessen friction. Transparent films are used for partial or closed wounds with little to no exudate, such as intravenous access sites, skin donor sites, lacerations, and abrasions (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Bryant &#x0026; Nix, 2016</a>; <a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Miline, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2592">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical management of skin disorders includes a host of prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) pharmacologic therapies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Medicated lotions, creams, ointments, gels, and powders are frequently used to treat skin disorders. In general, moisture-retentive dressings, with or without medication, are used in the acute stage; lotions and creams are reserved for the subacute stage; and ointments are used when inflammation has become chronic and the skin is dry with scaling or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;lichenification:&lt;/b&gt; thickening of the horny layer of the skin (&lt;em&gt;synonym&lt;/em&gt;: scaling)">lichenification</button></strong> (thickening of the horny layer of the skin).</p>
<p class="indent">High concentrations of some medications can be applied directly to the affected site with little systemic absorption and with few systemic side effects. However, some medications are readily absorbed through the skin and can produce systemic effects. Because topical preparations may induce allergic contact <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dermatitis:&lt;/b&gt; any inflammation of the skin">dermatitis</button></strong> (skin inflammation) in patients who are sensitive, any untoward response should be reported immediately and the medication discontinued.</p>
<p class="indent">With all types of topical medication, the patient is educated to apply the medication gently but thoroughly and, when necessary, to cover the medication with a dressing to protect clothing. <a href="#tt56-2">Table 56-2</a> lists select topical preparations and medications.</p>
<p class="h7">Lotions</p>
<p class="nonindent">Lotions are frequently used to replenish lost skin oils or to relieve pruritus. They must be applied every 3 or 4 hours for sustained therapeutic effect. They are usually applied directly to the skin, but a dressing soaked in the lotion can be placed on the affected area. However, if left in place for a longer period, it may crust and cake on the skin.</p>
<p class="indent">Lotions are of two types: suspensions and liniments. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;suspensions:&lt;/b&gt; liquid preparations in which powder is suspended, requiring shaking before use">Suspensions</button></strong> consist of either a powder in water that requires shaking before application, or clear solutions, which contain completely dissolved active ingredients. A suspension such as calamine lotion provides a rapid cooling and drying effect as it evaporates, leaving a thin, medicinal layer of powder on the affected skin. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;liniments:&lt;/b&gt; lotions with added oil for increased softening of the skin">Liniments</button></strong> are lotions with oil added to prevent crusting. Because lotions are easy to use, therapeutic adherence is generally good.</p>
<p class="h7">Powders</p>
<p class="nonindent">Powders usually have a talc, zinc oxide, bentonite, or cornstarch base and are dusted on the skin with a shaker or with cotton sponges. Although their therapeutic action is brief, powders act as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hygroscopic:&lt;/b&gt; a material that absorbs moisture from the air">hygroscopic</button></strong> agents that absorb and retain moisture from the air and reduce friction between skin surfaces and clothing or bedding.</p>
<p class="h7">Creams</p>
<p class="nonindent">Creams may be suspensions of oil in water or emulsions of water in oil, with additional ingredients to prevent bacterial and fungal growth. Both may cause an allergic reaction such as contact dermatitis. Oil-in-water creams are easily applied and usually are the most cosmetically acceptable to the patient. Although they can be used on the face, they tend to have a drying effect. Water-in-oil emulsions are greasier and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1820" title="1820"></span>are preferred for drying and flaking dermatoses. Creams usually are rubbed into the skin by hand. They are used for their moisturizing and emollient effects.</p>
<p class="h7">Gels</p>
<p class="nonindent">Gels are semisolid emulsions that become liquid when applied to the skin or scalp. They are cosmetically acceptable to the patient because they are not visible after application, and they are greaseless and nonstaining. Water-based gels penetrate the skin more effectively and cause less stinging on application. They are especially useful for acute dermatitis in which there is weeping exudate (e.g., poison ivy) and are applied the same way as creams.</p>
<p class="h7">Pastes</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pastes are mixtures of powders and ointments and are used in inflammatory blistering conditions. They adhere to the skin and may be difficult to remove without using an oil (e.g., olive oil, mineral oil). Pastes are applied with a wooden tongue depressor or gloved hand.</p>
<p class="h7">Ointments</p>
<p class="nonindent">Ointments retard water loss and lubricate and protect the skin. They are the preferred vehicle for delivering medication to chronic or localized dry skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. Ointments are applied with a wooden tongue depressor or gloved hand.</p>
<p class="h7">Sprays and Aerosols</p>
<p class="nonindent">Spray and aerosol preparations may be used on any widespread dermatologic condition. They evaporate on contact and are used infrequently.</p>
<p class="h7">Topical Corticosteroids</p>
<p class="nonindent">Corticosteroids are widely used in treating dermatologic conditions to provide anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects. The patient is educated to apply this medication according to strict guidelines, using it sparingly but rubbing it into the prescribed area thoroughly. Absorption of topical corticosteroids is enhanced when the skin is hydrated or the affected area is covered by an occlusive or moisture-retentive dressing (<a href="c56-sec32.xhtml#bib4104">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>). Inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids can result in local and systemic side effects, especially when the medication is absorbed through inflamed and excoriated skin; it is used under occlusive dressings, or is used for longer time periods on sensitive areas. Local side effects may include skin atrophy and thinning, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;striae:&lt;/b&gt; bandlike streaks on the skin, distinguished by color, texture, depression, or elevation from the tissue in which they are found; usually purplish or white">striae</button></strong> (bandlike streaks), and telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels). Thinning of the skin results from the ability of corticosteroids to inhibit skin collagen synthesis. The thinning process can be reversed by discontinuing the medication, but striae and telangiectasia are permanent. Systemic side effects may include hyperglycemia and symptoms of Cushing syndrome (see <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>). Caution is required when applying corticosteroids around the eyes because long-term use may cause glaucoma or cataracts, and the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids may mask existing viral or fungal infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Concentrated (fluorinated) corticosteroids should never be applied on the face or intertriginous areas (i.e., axillae and groin) because these areas have a thinner stratum corneum and therefore absorption is enhanced. Persistent use of concentrated topical corticosteroids in any location may produce acnelike dermatitis, known as steroid-induced acne, and hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth). Because some topical corticosteroid preparations are available without prescription, patients should be cautioned about prolonged and inappropriate use. <a href="#tt56-3">Table 56-3</a> lists select topical corticosteroid preparations according to potency.</p>
<p class="h7">Intralesional Therapy</p>
<p class="nonindent">Intralesional therapy consists of injecting a sterile suspension of medication (usually a corticosteroid) into or just below a lesion. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1821" title="1821"></span>Although this treatment may have an anti-inflammatory effect, local atrophy and discoloration may result if the medication is injected into subcutaneous fat. Skin lesions treated with intralesional therapy include psoriasis, keloids, and cystic acne. Occasionally, immunotherapeutic and antifungal agents are given as intralesional therapy.</p>

<p class="h7">Systemic Medications</p>
<p class="nonindent">Systemic medications are also prescribed for skin conditions. These include corticosteroids for short-term therapy of contact dermatitis or for long-term treatment of a chronic <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dermatosis:&lt;/b&gt; any abnormal skin lesion">dermatosis</button></strong> (skin lesion), such as pemphigus vulgaris. Other frequently used systemic medications include antibiotic, antifungal, antihistamine, sedative, analgesic, tranquilizing, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytotoxic:&lt;/b&gt; destructive of cells">cytotoxic</button></strong> (destructive of cells), and immunosuppressive agents.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2593">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of the patient prescribed pharmacologic therapy to treat a skin disorder begins with a focused dermatologic health history, direct observation, and a complete physical examination (see <a href="c55.xhtml">Chapter 55</a>). Because of its visibility, a skin condition is usually difficult to ignore or conceal from others and may therefore cause the patient emotional distress. The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of skin integrity, relief of discomfort, promotion of restful sleep, self-acceptance, knowledge about skin care, and avoidance of complications.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing management for patients who must perform self-care for skin problems, such as applying medications and dressings, focuses on educating the patient about how to cleanse the affected area and pat it dry; apply medication to the lesion while the skin is moist; cover the area with plastic (e.g., Telfa&#x2122; pads, plastic wrap, vinyl gloves, plastic bag) if recommended; and cover it with an elastic bandage, dressing, or paper tape to seal the edges. Dressings that contain or cover a topical corticosteroid should be removed for 12 of every 24 hours to prevent adverse events.</p>
<p class="indent">Other forms of dressings, such as those used to cover topical medications, include soft cotton cloth and stretchable cotton dressings (e.g., Surgitube&#x2122;, Tubegauz&#x2122;) that can be used for fingers, toes, hands, and feet. The hands can be covered with disposable polyethylene or vinyl gloves sealed at the wrists; the feet can be wrapped in plastic bags covered by cotton socks. Gloves and socks that are already impregnated with emollients, making application to the hands and feet more convenient, are also available. When large areas of the body must be covered, cotton cloth topped by an expandable stockinette can be used. Disposable diapers or cloths folded in diaper fashion are useful for dressing the groin and the perineal areas. Axillary dressings can be made of cotton cloth, or a commercially prepared dressing may be used and taped in place or held by dress shields. A turban or plastic shower cap is useful for holding dressings on the scalp. A face mask, made from gauze with holes cut out for the eyes, nose, and mouth, may be held in place with gauze ties looped through holes cut in the four corners of the mask.</p>
