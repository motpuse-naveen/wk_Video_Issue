<h4 class="h4" id="s94">Genomic Framework for Nursing&#x00A0;Practice</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses&#x2019; contribution to genomic focused health care offers a holistic perspective that takes into account each person&#x2019;s intellectual, physical, spiritual, social, cultural, biopsychological, ethical, and aesthetic experiences. Because genomics addresses all of the genes of a given person&#x2019;s human genome working together as a whole, genomics expands nursing&#x2019;s holistic view. Genetics and genomics are the basis of normal and pathophysiologic development, human health and disease, and health outcomes. Knowledge and interpretation of genetic and genomic information, gene-based testing, diagnosis, and treatment broaden the holistic view of nursing. It is a professional expectation that nurses understand genetics and genomics, and can apply this information in the clinical setting (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">American Nurses Association [ANA], 2017</a>; <a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib413">Rogers, Lizer, Doughty, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Essentials of Genetic and Genomic Nursing</em> (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>) provides a framework for integrating genetics and genomics into nursing practice (<a href="c06.xhtml#ct6-1">Chart&#x00A0;6-1</a>). This document includes a philosophy of care that recognizes when genetic and genomic factors play a role or could play a role <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page118" title="118"></span>in a person&#x2019;s health. This means assessing predictive genetic and genomic factors using family history and the results of genetic tests effectively, informing patients about genetic and genomic concepts, understanding the personal and societal impact of genetics and genomic information, and valuing the privacy and confidentiality of genetics and genomic information. There is also formal consensus regarding higher-level competencies in the application of genetics and genomics for nurses with graduate degrees. In addition, nurses need to be aware of genetic and genomic standards of practice as it relates to their specific area of clinical practice (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Kerber &#x0026; Ledbetter, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A person&#x2019;s response to genetic and genomic information, genetic testing, or genetic-related conditions may be either empowering or disabling. Genetic and genomic information may stigmatize people if it affects how they view themselves or how others view them. Nurses help individuals and families learn how genetic traits and conditions are passed on within families as well as how genetic and environmental factors influence health and disease (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>). Nurses facilitate communication among family members, the health care system, and community resources, and they offer valuable support to patients and families. All nurses should be able to apply genetic and genomic knowledge by (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib351">ANA, 2017</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>providing basic genetic or genomic information to a patient or family member,</span></li>
<li><span>obtaining family health histories that are inclusive of genetic information for at least three generations,</span></li>
<li><span>conducting physical and developmental assessments and then correlating relevant assessment findings to genetic alterations,</span></li>
<li><span>formulating nursing diagnoses based on actual or potential genetic risk,</span></li>
<li><span>implementing nursing care that is reflective of genetic and genomic competencies,</span></li>
<li><span>facilitating genetic and genomic referrals, and</span></li>
<li><span>collaborating with other health professionals.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">For example, when nurses assess patients&#x2019; cardiovascular risk, they can expand their assessment to include information about family history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, clotting disorders, or premature sudden cardiac death. Knowledge that genes are involved in the control of lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, blood pressure regulation, clotting factors, cardiac structure, and vascular lining function helps individualize care based on the patient&#x2019;s genetic and genomic risk profile.</p>
<p class="indent">Essential to a genetic and genomic framework in nursing is the awareness of one&#x2019;s attitudes, experience, and assumptions about genetics and genomic concepts and how these are manifested in one&#x2019;s own practice (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib352">Consensus Panel, 2009</a>). To develop awareness of these attitudes, experiences, and assumptions, nurses must examine their own:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Beliefs or values about health as well as family, religious, or cultural beliefs about the cause of illness and how one&#x2019;s values or biases affect understanding of genetic conditions</span></li>
<li><span>Philosophical, theologic, cultural, and ethical perspectives related to health and how these perspectives influence one&#x2019;s use of genetic information or services</span></li>
<li><span>Level of expertise about genetics and genomics</span></li>
<li><span>Experiences with birth defects, chronic illnesses, and genetic conditions, along with one&#x2019;s view of such conditions as disabling or empowering</span></li>
<li><span>Attitudes about the right to access and other rights of individuals with genetic disorders</span></li>
<li><span>View and assumptions about deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and beliefs about the value of information about one&#x2019;s risk for genetic disorders</span></li>
<li><span>Beliefs about reproductive options</span></li>
<li><span>View of genetic testing and engineering</span></li>
<li><span>Approach to patients with disability</span></li></ul>
