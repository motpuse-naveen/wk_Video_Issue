<h4 class="h4" id="s3188">Providing Holistic Care</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Patients and families experiencing sudden injury or illness are often overwhelmed by anxiety because they have not had time to adapt to the crisis. They experience real and terrifying fear of death, mutilation, immobilization, and other assaults on their personal identity and bodily integrity. When confronted with trauma, severe disfigurement, severe illness, or sudden death, the family experiences several stages of crisis. The stages begin with anxiety and progress through denial, remorse and guilt, anger, grief, and reconciliation. The initial goal for the patient and family is anxiety reduction, a prerequisite to effective and appropriate coping. During this stressful time, safety is of primary importance. Close observation and preplanning are essential and security personnel are stationed nearby in the event that a patient or family member responds to stress with physical violence.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of the patient and family&#x2019;s psychological function includes evaluating emotional expression, degree of anxiety, and cognitive functioning. Possible nursing diagnoses include:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Anxiety or death anxiety associated with uncertain potential outcomes of the illness or trauma</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Difficulty coping associated with acute situational crisis</p>
<p class="indent">Possible nursing diagnoses for the family include:</p>
<p class="BL1Firsta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Family grief</p>
<p class="BL1Middlea"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Interrupted family process</p>
<p class="BL1Lasta"><span class="bull1a"><span class="listbl1">&#x2022;</span></span>Impaired or risk for impaired family coping associated with acute situational crises</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3189">Patient-Focused Interventions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clinicians caring for the patient should act confidently and competently to relieve anxiety and promote a sense of security. Explanations should be given that the patient can understand. Human contact and reassuring words reduce the panic of the person who is severely injured or ill and aid in dispelling fear of the unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who is unconscious should be treated as if conscious&#x2014;that is, the patient should be touched, called by name, and provided an explanation of every procedure that is performed. As the patient regains consciousness, the nurse should orient the patient by stating their name, the date, and the location. This basic information should be provided repeatedly, as needed, in a reassuring way.</p>
<p class="indent">Ensuring patient safety is a major focus in clinical practice settings. Some of the most common <strong>sentinel events</strong> (unanticipated events that result in patient harm) in the ED include delays to care and medication errors. Common root causes for these sentinel events revolve around nurse staffing patterns, patient volume, and specialty availability. Solutions to patient safety issues in the ED include ensuring optimal nurse staffing, pharmacy presence, and rapid diagnostics turnaround times to minimize wait time to diagnosis and fostering teamwork and support by leadership. All errors should be reported and investigated even if a patient was not harmed. In this way, future injury or death may be avoided (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4675">The Joint Commission, 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3190">Family-Focused Interventions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The family is kept informed about where the patient is, how they are doing, and the care that is being given. Encouraging family members to stay with the patient, when possible, also helps alleviate their anxieties. In many facilities, family presence during resuscitation is permitted to assist the family to cope through this difficult time. Many family members respond very well to this approach. Research has indicated that families view emergency professionals favorably when a family member was resuscitated. They view their role as supportive and protective of the patient. Allowing family presence in the critical care areas of the hospital, whenever possible, enhances the family role and builds trust in the caregivers (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Toronto &#x0026; LaRocco, 2019</a>). The presence of a family facilitator, who is trained to provide support to family members, is vital to the success of a family presence program (ENA, 2017). Additional interventions are based on the assessment of the stage of crisis that the family is experiencing. Measures to help family members cope with sudden death are presented in <a href="#ct67-2">Chart 67-2</a>.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Helping Family Members Cope with Sudden Death</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">When able to do so, the nurse takes the following actions:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take the family to a private place.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Talk to the family together so that they can grieve together and hear the information given together.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Reassure the family that everything possible was done; inform them of the treatment rendered.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid using euphemisms such as &#x201C;passed on.&#x201D; Show the family that you care by touching, offering coffee, water, and the services of a chaplain.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encourage family members to support each other and to express emotions freely (grief, loss, anger, helplessness, tears, disbelief).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid giving sedation to family members; this may mask or delay the grieving process, which is necessary to achieve emotional equilibrium and to prevent prolonged depression.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Encourage the family to view the body if they wish; this action helps to integrate the loss. Cover disfigured and injured areas before the family sees the body. Go with the family and do not leave them alone. Show acceptance by touching the body to give the family &#x201C;permission&#x201D; to touch.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Spend time with the family, listening to them and identifying any needs that they may have for which the nursing staff can be helpful.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Allow family members to talk about the deceased and what the person meant to them; this permits ventilation of feelings of loss. Encourage the family to talk about events preceding admission to the emergency department. Do not challenge initial feelings of anger or denial.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid volunteering unnecessary information (e.g., the patient was drinking).</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara"><em>Note</em>: These interventions might not be advisable or permitted if &#x201C;social distancing&#x201D; prohibitions are in place, such as those prohibitions implemented to thwart transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Anxiety and Denial</h6>
<p class="nonindent">During these crises, family members are encouraged to recognize and talk about their feelings of anxiety. Asking questions is encouraged. Honest answers given at the level of the family&#x2019;s understanding must be provided. Although denial is an ego-defense mechanism that protects individuals from recognizing painful and disturbing aspects of reality, prolonged denial is not encouraged or supported. The family must be prepared for the reality of what has happened and what may come (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Ocak &#x0026; Avsarogullari, 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Remorse and Guilt</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Expressions of remorse and guilt are common, with family members accusing themselves (or each other) of negligence or minor omissions. Family members are urged to verbalize their feelings to help them cope appropriately.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Anger</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Expressions of anger, common in crisis situations, are a way of handling anxiety and fear. Anger is frequently directed by the family at the patient, but it is also often expressed toward the physician, the nurse, or admitting personnel. The therapeutic approach is to allow the anger to be expressed and to assist the family members to identify their feelings of frustration.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Grief</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Grief is a complex emotional response to anticipated or actual loss. The key nursing intervention is to help family members work through their grief and to support their coping mechanisms, letting them know that it is normal and acceptable for them to cry, feel pain, and express loss. The hospital chaplain and social services staff serve as invaluable members of the team when assisting families to work through their grief (see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3191">Caring for Emergency Personnel</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Concerted efforts have been made to focus on the needs of the ED staff, especially after serious and stressful events (ENA, 2020a). Events can range from a local trauma case involving children; to treating someone known to the emergency worker, such as a colleague or family member; to a more complex natural disaster or mass casualty incident. It is important to remember that all staff members may not necessarily respond in the same way; an event that is stressful to one person may not be as stressful to another. Compassion fatigue may result from continuous exposure to suffering and injury, and energy is expended on a daily basis. Fatigue occurs when the affected staff members cannot replenish energy stores (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Schmidt &#x0026; Haglund, 2017</a>). In addition, because stress is a daily occurrence in the ED, staff may not recognize the personal effect of any one event or the cumulative effect of day-to-day crisis interventions. ED leadership should be aware of staff coping patterns and support systems, patterns of interactions between staff members, staff members&#x2019; health problems, including addiction, and appropriately assist with identifying behaviors caused by workplace stress. The availability of nonjudgmental counseling is essential to promoting a healthy staff.</p>
<p class="indent">After serious events, critical incident stress management (CISM) is useful to critique individual and group performance and to facilitate healthy coping. Optimally, this consists of three steps: defusing, debriefing, and follow-up. Defusing occurs immediately after the critical incident. During this session, affected staff are encouraged to discuss their feelings about the incident, are reassured that negative reactions and feelings are normal but that these diminish over time, and are given contact information so that they may talk to someone if they have disturbing symptoms (e.g., sleeplessness, excessive worry). Debriefing typically occurs 1 to 10 days after the critical incident. Debriefing sessions follow a format similar to the initial defusing session; however, during these sessions, participating staff are encouraged to discuss their feelings about the incident and are again reassured that their negative reactions and feelings are normal and that their negative feelings will diminish over time. At the end of these sessions, participants should have a feeling of closure and be able to resume their professional roles at an emotional level commensurate to that prior to the critical incident. Some staff may require further professional follow-up, however. Follow-up may occur after the debriefing session is completed for those participants who have persistent negative symptoms and may consist of continued individual or group counseling and therapy (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Schmidt &#x0026; Haglund, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s3192"><img class="m" src="images/rtxtv1.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Holistic, patient-centered care remains a top priority in EDs, even during disaster situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also a top priority that emergency nurses have the mechanisms and support to properly manage their heightened stress during such situations. Assuring holistic care of patients and families and supporting the emotional well-being of emergency staff pose unique challenges during such disasters as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="indent">In particular, regulations and mitigation strategies enforced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic prohibit family and visitor presence during hospitalizations in geographic regions experiencing an upswing in confirmed cases in order to keep patients, family members, and health care workers safe (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4654">Hart, Turnbull, Oppenheim, et al., 2020</a>). Family presence and visitation policies are adapted in efforts to maintain open communication and family involvement in patient care. These adaptive strategies rely heavily on technology, which include the use of smartphones and computers, and require stable Internet connection and technologic literacy. Barriers exist for patients and families who either lack technologic literacy or who come from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, which preclude their ability to be able to tap into engaging in virtual conversations (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Hart et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">During these difficult times, ED staff are encouraged to develop a communication plan with family members, designating one person as the point of contact, ensuring that contact person has adequate access to technology, and identifying and eliminating any barriers to effective communication. Videoconferencing can be used when possible, particularly during end-of-life situations (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Hart et al., 2020</a>). The use of support teams that includes pastoral care, palliative care, and behavioral health should be mobilized to assist in the grieving process (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4698">Hart et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 2183</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page2184" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="2184">p. 2184</span></div>
<p class="indent">The emotional burden experienced by emergency nurses on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported to be greatly magnified. Emergency nurses reportedly experienced fear as they faced a shortage of PPE, emotional and physical exhaustion, and ongoing stress. In some cases, nurses were the only persons physically present with patients who were severely ill and provided the only source of distant communication between patients and their family members. Confronted with not being able to provide the care for patients as they would have done under nonpandemic conditions, many emergency nurses experienced moral distress. Moral distress can be disruptive to emotional health; symptoms may include &#x201C;self-criticism, intense feelings of shame, guilt, or disgust and may contribute to depression or post-traumatic stress disorder&#x201D; (American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 2020, p. 1). Although the ultimate long-term impact of COVID-19 on the health of emergency nurses is not known at this time, supportive strategies must be implemented in order to preserve the health care workforce that has experienced severe stress as a consequence of COVID-19 (<a href="c67-sec51.xhtml#bib4675">The Joint Commission, 2020</a>).</p>
