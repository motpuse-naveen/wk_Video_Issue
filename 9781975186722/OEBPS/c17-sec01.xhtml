<h4 class="h4" id="s521">Anatomic and Physiologic Overview</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The respiratory system is composed of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Together, the two tracts are responsible for <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ventilation:&lt;/b&gt; movement of air in and out of the airways">ventilation</button></strong> (movement of air in and out of the airways). The upper respiratory tract, known as the upper airway, warms and filters inspired air so that the lower respiratory tract (the lungs) can accomplish gas exchange or diffusion. Gas exchange involves delivering oxygen to the tissues through the bloodstream and expelling waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, during expiration. The respiratory system depends on the cardiovascular system for perfusion, or blood flow through the pulmonary system (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s522">Anatomy of the Respiratory System</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Upper Respiratory Tract</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Upper airway structures consist of the nose; paranasal sinuses; pharynx, tonsils, and adenoids; larynx; and trachea.</p>
<p class="h7">Nose</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nose serves as a passageway for air to pass to and from the lungs. It filters impurities and humidifies and warms the air as it is inhaled. The nose is composed of an external and an internal portion. The external portion protrudes from the face and is supported by the nasal bones and cartilage. The anterior nares (nostrils) are the external openings of the nasal cavities.</p>
<p class="indent">The internal portion of the nose is a hollow cavity separated into the right and left nasal cavities by a narrow vertical divider, the septum. Each nasal cavity is divided into three passageways by the projection of the turbinates from the lateral walls. The turbinate bones are also called <em>conchae</em> (the name suggested by their shell-like appearance). Because of their curves, these bones increase the mucous membrane surface of the nasal passages and slightly obstruct the air flowing through them (<a href="#ff17-1">Fig.&#x00A0;17-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Air entering the nostrils is deflected upward to the roof of the nose, and it follows a circuitous route before it reaches the nasopharynx. It comes into contact with a large surface of moist, warm, highly vascular, ciliated mucous membrane (called <em>nasal mucosa</em>) that traps practically all of the dust and organisms in the inhaled air. The air is moistened, warmed to body temperature, and brought into contact with sensitive nerves. Some of these nerves detect odors; others provoke sneezing to expel irritating dust. Mucus, secreted continuously by goblet cells, covers the surface of the nasal mucosa and is moved back to the nasopharynx by the action of the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cilia:&lt;/b&gt; short, fine hairs that provide a constant whipping motion that serves to propel mucus and foreign substances away from the lung toward the larynx">cilia</button></strong> (short, fine hairs).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff17-1">

<img src="images/ff17-1.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff17-1.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;17-1 &#x2022;</span> Cross-section of nasal cavity.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h7">Paranasal Sinuses</p>
<p class="nonindent">The paranasal sinuses include four pairs of bony cavities that are lined with nasal mucosa and ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. These airspaces are connected by a series of ducts that drain into the nasal cavity. The sinuses are named by their location: frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary (<a href="#ff17-2">Fig.&#x00A0;17-2</a>). A prominent function of the sinuses is to serve as a resonating chamber in speech. The sinuses are a common site of infection.</p>
<p class="h7">Pharynx, Tonsils, and Adenoids</p>
<p class="nonindent">The pharynx, or throat, is a tubelike structure that connects the nasal and oral cavities to the larynx. It is divided into three regions: nasal, oral, and laryngeal. The nasopharynx is located posterior to the nose and above the soft palate. The oropharynx houses the faucial, or palatine, tonsils. The laryngopharynx extends from the hyoid bone to the cricoid cartilage. The epiglottis forms the entrance to the larynx.</p>

<p class="indent">The adenoids, or pharyngeal tonsils, are located in the roof of the nasopharynx. The tonsils, the adenoids, and other lymphoid tissue encircle the throat. These structures are important links in the chain of lymph nodes guarding the body from invasion by organisms entering the nose and the throat. The pharynx functions as a passageway for the respiratory and digestive tracts.</p>
<p class="h7">Larynx</p>
<p class="nonindent">The larynx, or voice box, is a cartilaginous epithelium-lined organ that connects the pharynx and the trachea and consists of the following:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span><em>Epiglottis:</em> a valve flap of cartilage that covers the opening to the larynx during swallowing</span></li>
<li><span><em>Glottis:</em> the opening between the vocal cords in the larynx</span></li>
<li><span><em>Thyroid cartilage:</em> the largest of the cartilage structures; part of it forms the Adam&#x2019;s apple</span></li>
<li><span><em>Cricoid cartilage:</em> the only complete cartilaginous ring in the larynx (located below the thyroid cartilage)</span></li>
<li><span><em>Arytenoid cartilages:</em> used in vocal cord movement with the thyroid cartilage</span></li>
<li><span><em>Vocal cords:</em> ligaments controlled by muscular movements that produce sounds; located in the lumen of the larynx</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Although the major function of the larynx is vocalization, it also protects the lower airway from foreign substances and facilitates coughing; it is, therefore, sometimes referred to as the &#x201C;watchdog of the lungs&#x201D; (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Trachea</p>
<p class="nonindent">The trachea, or windpipe, is composed of smooth muscle with C-shaped rings of cartilage at regular intervals. The cartilaginous rings are incomplete on the posterior surface and give firmness to the wall of the trachea, preventing it from collapsing. The trachea serves as the passage between the larynx and the right and left main stem bronchi, which enter the lungs through an opening called the <em>hilus.</em></p>
<h6 class="h6">Lower Respiratory Tract</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The lower respiratory tract consists of the lungs, which contain the bronchial and alveolar structures needed for gas exchange.</p>
<p class="h7">Lungs</p>
<p class="nonindent">The lungs are paired elastic structures enclosed in the thoracic cage, which is an airtight chamber with distensible walls (<a href="#ff17-3">Fig.&#x00A0;17-3</a>). Each lung is divided into lobes. The right lung has upper, middle, and lower lobes, whereas the left lung consists of upper and lower lobes (<a href="#ff17-4">Fig.&#x00A0;17-4</a>). Each lobe is further subdivided into two to five segments separated by fissures, which are extensions of the pleura.</p>
<p class="h8">Pleura</p>
<p class="nonindent">The lungs and wall of the thoracic cavity are lined with a serous membrane called the <em>pleura.</em> The visceral pleura covers the lungs; the parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity, lateral wall of the mediastinum, diaphragm, and inner aspects of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page465" title="465"></span>ribs. The visceral and parietal pleura and the small amount of pleural fluid between these two membranes serve to lubricate the thorax and the lungs and permit smooth motion of the lungs within the thoracic cavity during inspiration and expiration.</p>

The lungs consist of five lobes. The right lung has three lobes (upper, middle, lower); the left has two (upper and lower). The lobes are further subdivided by fissures. The bronchial tree, another lung structure, inflates with air to fill the lobes.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="h8">Mediastinum</p>
<p class="nonindent">The mediastinum is in the middle of the thorax, between the pleural sacs that contain the two lungs. It extends from the sternum to the vertebral column and contains all of the thoracic tissue outside the lungs (heart, thymus, the aorta and vena cava, and esophagus).</p>
<p class="h8">Bronchi and Bronchioles</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are several divisions of the bronchi within each lobe of the lung. First are the lobar bronchi (three in the right lung and two in the left lung). Lobar bronchi divide into segmental bronchi (10 on the right and 8 on the left); these structures facilitate effective postural drainage in the patient. Segmental bronchi then divide into subsegmental bronchi. These bronchi are surrounded by connective tissue that contains arteries, lymphatics, and nerves.</p>
<p class="indent">The subsegmental bronchi then branch into bronchioles, which have no cartilage in their walls. Their patency depends entirely on the elastic recoil of the surrounding smooth muscle and on the alveolar pressure. The bronchioles contain submucosal glands, which produce mucus that covers the inside lining of the airways. The bronchi and bronchioles are also lined with cells that have surfaces covered with cilia. These cilia create a constant whipping motion that propels mucus and foreign substances away from the lungs toward the larynx.</p>
<p class="indent">The bronchioles branch into terminal bronchioles, which do not have mucous glands or cilia. Terminal bronchioles become respiratory bronchioles, which are considered to be the transitional passageways between the conducting airways and the gas exchange airways. Up to this point, the conducting airways contain about 150 mL of air in the tracheobronchial tree that does not participate in gas exchange, known as <strong>physiologic dead space.</strong> The respiratory bronchioles then lead into alveolar ducts and sacs and then alveoli (see <a href="#ff17-3">Fig.&#x00A0;17-3</a>). Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange takes place in the alveoli.</p>
<p class="h8">Alveoli</p>
<p class="nonindent">The lung is made up of about 300 million alveoli, constituting a total surface area between 50 and 100 m<sup>2</sup> (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Norris, 2019</a>). There are three types of alveolar cells. Type I and type II cells make up the alveolar epithelium. Type I cells account for 95% of the alveolar surface area and serve as a barrier between the air and the alveolar surface; type II cells account for only 5% of this area but are responsible for producing type I cells and surfactant. Surfactant reduces surface tension, thereby improving overall lung function. Alveolar macrophages, the third type of alveolar cells, are phagocytic cells that ingest foreign matter and, as a result, provide an important defense mechanism.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s523">Function of the Respiratory System <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></h5>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be86f669209b" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Gas Exchange in Alveoli</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">The cells of the body derive the energy they need from the oxidation of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This process requires oxygen. Vital tissues, like the brain and the heart, cannot survive long without a continuous supply of oxygen. As a result of oxidation, carbon dioxide is produced and must be removed from the cells to prevent the buildup of acid waste products. The respiratory system performs this function by facilitating life-sustaining processes such as oxygen transport, respiration, ventilation, and gas exchange.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Oxygen Transport</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen is supplied to, and carbon dioxide is removed from, cells by way of the circulating blood through the thin walls of the capillaries. Oxygen diffuses from the capillary through the capillary wall to the interstitial fluid. At this point, it diffuses through the membrane of tissue cells, where it is used by mitochondria for cellular respiration. The movement of carbon dioxide occurs by diffusion in the opposite direction&#x2014;from cell to blood.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 465</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page466" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="466">p. 466</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Respiration</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After these tissue capillary exchanges, blood enters the systemic venous circulation and travels to the pulmonary circulation. The oxygen concentration in blood within the capillaries of the lungs is lower than that in the lungs&#x2019; alveoli. Because of this concentration gradient, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli to the blood. Carbon dioxide, which has a higher concentration in the blood than in the alveoli, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. Movement of air in and out of the airways continually replenishes the oxygen and removes the carbon dioxide from the airways and the lungs. This whole process of gas exchange between the atmospheric air and the blood and between the blood and cells of the body is called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;respiration:&lt;/b&gt; gas exchange between atmospheric air and the blood and between the blood and cells of the body">respiration</button></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">Ventilation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ventilation requires movement of the walls of the thoracic cage and of its floor, the diaphragm. The effect of these movements is alternately to increase and decrease the capacity of the chest. When the capacity of the chest is increased, air enters through the trachea (inspiration) and moves into the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, and inflates the lungs. When the chest wall and the diaphragm return to their previous positions (expiration), the lungs recoil and force the air out through the bronchi and the trachea. Inspiration occurs during the first third of the respiratory cycle; expiration occurs during the latter two thirds. The inspiratory phase of respiration normally requires energy; the expiratory phase is normally passive, requiring very little energy. Physical factors that govern airflow in and out of the lungs are collectively referred to as the mechanics of ventilation and include air pressure variances, resistance to airflow, and lung compliance.</p>
<p class="h7">Air Pressure Variances</p>
<p class="nonindent">Air flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure. During inspiration, movements of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles enlarge the thoracic cavity and thereby lower the pressure inside the thorax to a level below that of atmospheric pressure. As a result, air is drawn through the trachea and the bronchi into the alveoli. During expiration, the diaphragm relaxes and the lungs recoil, resulting in a decrease in the size of the thoracic cavity. The alveolar pressure then exceeds atmospheric pressure, and air flows from the lungs into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="h7">Airway Resistance</p>
<p class="nonindent">Resistance is determined by the radius, or size of the airway through which the air is flowing, as well as by lung volumes and airflow velocity. Any process that changes the bronchial diameter or width affects airway resistance and alters the rate of airflow for a given pressure gradient during respiration (<a href="#ct17-1">Chart&#x00A0;17-1</a>). With increased resistance, greater-than-normal respiratory effort is required to achieve normal levels of ventilation.</p>
<p class="h7">Compliance</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;compliance:&lt;/b&gt; measure of the force required to expand or inflate the lungs">Compliance</button></strong> is the elasticity and expandability of the lungs and thoracic structures. Compliance allows the lung volume to increase when the difference in pressure between the atmosphere and the thoracic cavity (pressure gradient) causes air to flow in. Factors that determine lung compliance are the surface tension of the alveoli, the connective tissue and water content of the lungs, and the compliance of the thoracic cavity.</p>
<div class="box1a">
<p class="BoxpNumber" id="ct17-1"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;17-1</strong></p></div>
<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Causes of Increased Airway Resistance</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Common phenomena that may alter bronchial diameter, which affects airway resistance, include the following:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Contraction of bronchial smooth muscle&#x2014;as in asthma</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Thickening of bronchial mucosa&#x2014;as in chronic bronchitis</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obstruction of the airway&#x2014;by mucus, a tumor, or a foreign body</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Loss of lung elasticity&#x2014;as in emphysema, which is characterized by connective tissue encircling the airways, thereby keeping them open during both inspiration and expiration</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Compliance is determined by examining the volume&#x2013;pressure relationship in the lungs and the thorax. Compliance is normal (1 L/cm H<sub>2</sub>O) if the lungs and the thorax easily stretch and distend when pressure is applied. Increased compliance occurs if the lungs have lost their elastic recoil and become overdistended (e.g., in emphysema). Decreased compliance occurs if the lungs and the thorax are &#x201C;stiff.&#x201D; Conditions associated with decreased compliance include severe obesity, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Lungs with decreased compliance require greater-than-normal energy expenditure by the patient to achieve normal levels of ventilation.</p>
<p class="h7">Lung Volumes and Capacities</p>
<p class="nonindent">Lung function, which reflects the mechanics of ventilation, is viewed in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities. Lung volumes are categorized as tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, and residual volume. Lung capacity is evaluated in terms of vital capacity, inspiratory capacity, functional residual capacity, and total lung capacity. These terms are explained in <a href="#tt17-1">Table&#x00A0;17-1</a>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pulmonary Diffusion and Perfusion</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pulmonary diffusion:&lt;/b&gt; exchange of gas molecules (oxygen and carbon dioxide) from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration">Pulmonary diffusion</button></strong> is the process by which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration at the air&#x2013;blood interface. The alveolar&#x2013;capillary membrane is ideal for diffusion because of its thinness and large surface area. In the normal healthy adult, oxygen and carbon dioxide travel across the alveolar&#x2013;capillary membrane without difficulty as a result of differences in gas concentrations in the alveoli and capillaries.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pulmonary perfusion:&lt;/b&gt; blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature">Pulmonary perfusion</button></strong> is the actual blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. The blood is pumped into the lungs by the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery divides into the right and left branches to supply both lungs. Normally, about 2% of the blood pumped by the right ventricle does not perfuse the alveolar capillaries. This shunted blood drains into the left side of the heart without participating in alveolar gas exchange. Bronchial arteries extending from the thoracic aorta also support perfusion but do not participate in gas exchange, further diluting oxygenated blood exiting through the pulmonary vein (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">The pulmonary circulation is considered a low-pressure system because the systolic blood pressure in the pulmonary artery is 20 to 30 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure is 5 to 15 mm Hg. Because of these low pressures, the pulmonary vasculature normally can vary its capacity to accommodate the blood flow it receives. However, when a person is in an upright position, the pulmonary artery pressure is not great enough to supply blood to the apex of the lung against the force of gravity. Thus, when a person is upright, the lung may be considered to be divided into three sections: an upper part with poor blood supply, a lower part with maximal blood supply, and a section between the two with an intermediate supply of blood. When a person who is lying down turns to one side, more blood passes to the dependent lung.</p>
<p class="indent">Perfusion is also influenced by alveolar pressure. The pulmonary capillaries are sandwiched between adjacent alveoli. If the alveolar pressure is sufficiently high, the capillaries are squeezed. Depending on the pressure, some capillaries completely collapse, whereas others narrow.</p>
<p class="indent">Pulmonary artery pressure, gravity, and alveolar pressure determine the patterns of perfusion. In lung disease, these factors vary, and the perfusion of the lung may become abnormal.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ventilation and Perfusion Balance and Imbalance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adequate gas exchange depends on an adequate ventilation&#x2013;perfusion (V./Q.) ratio. In different areas of the lung, the V./Q. ratio varies. Airway blockages, local changes in compliance, and gravity may alter ventilation. Alterations in perfusion may occur with a change in the pulmonary artery pressure, alveolar pressure, or gravity.</p>
<p class="indent">V./Q. imbalance occurs as a result of inadequate ventilation, inadequate perfusion, or both. There are four possible V./Q. states in the lung:normal V./Q. ratio, low V./Q. ratio (shunt), high V./Q. ratio (dead space), and absence of ventilation and perfusion (silent unit) (<a href="#ct17-2">Chart&#x00A0;17-2</a>). V./Q. imbalance causes shunting of blood, resulting in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hypoxia:&lt;/b&gt; inadequate supply of oxygen to the cell">hypoxia</button></strong> (low level of cellular oxygen). Shunting appears to be the main cause of hypoxia after thoracic or abdominal surgery and most types of respiratory failure. Severe hypoxia results when the amount of shunting exceeds 20%. Supplemental oxygen may eliminate hypoxia, depending on the type of V./Q. imbalance.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gas Exchange</h6>
<p class="h7">Partial Pressure of Gases</p>
<p class="nonindent">The air we breathe is a gaseous mixture consisting mainly of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (1%), and trace amounts of other gases including carbon dioxide, methane, and helium, among other gases. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 760 mm Hg. Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by each type of gas in a mixture of gases. The partial pressure of a gas is proportional to the concentration of that gas in the mixture. The total pressure exerted by the gaseous mixture, whether in the atmosphere or in the lungs, is equal to the sum of the partial pressures. The partial pressure of nitrogen is approximately 596 mm Hg, oxygen is 152 mm Hg, and argon is 7.6 mm Hg. <a href="#ct17-3">Chart&#x00A0;17-3</a> identifies and defines terms and abbreviations related to partial pressure of gases. However, the partial pressure of gases will be affected when the air is inhaled and humidified by the pulmonary tract. It is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page468" title="468"></span>possible to calculate the partial pressure of gases, specifically oxygen, within the alveoli.</p>

<p class="indent">Once the air enters the trachea, it becomes fully saturated with water vapor, which displaces some of the other gases. Water vapor exerts a pressure of 45 mm Hg when it fully saturates a mixture of gases at the body temperature of 37&#x00B0;C (98.6&#x00B0;F). Nitrogen and oxygen are responsible for almost all of the remaining 715 mm Hg pressure. Once this mixture enters the alveoli, it is further diluted by carbon dioxide. In the alveoli, the water vapor continues to exert a pressure of 45 mm Hg. Under typical baseline conditions (i.e., without supplemental oxygen and at sea level), the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen (PAO<sub>2</sub>) is approximately 100 mm Hg. This pressure ensures diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar&#x2013;capillary membranes, and then eventually into the arterial blood and to red blood cells for transport to meet systemic oxygenation needs (<a href="c17-sec03.xhtml#bib1371">Sharma, Hashmi, &#x0026; Rawat, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">When a gas is exposed to a liquid, the gas dissolves in the liquid until equilibrium is reached. The dissolved gas also exerts a partial pressure. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of the gas in the liquid is the same as the partial pressure of the gas in the gaseous mixture. Oxygenation of venous blood in the lung illustrates this point. In the lung, venous blood and alveolar oxygen are separated by a very thin alveolar membrane. Oxygen diffuses across this membrane to dissolve in the blood until <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page469" title="469"></span>the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is the same as that in the alveoli. However, because carbon dioxide is a by-product of oxidation in the cells, venous blood contains carbon dioxide at a higher partial pressure than that in the alveolar gas. In the lung, carbon dioxide diffuses out of venous blood into the alveolar gas. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and in alveolar gas is the same. The changes in partial pressure are shown in <a href="#ff17-5">Figure&#x00A0;17-5</a>.</p>

<p class="h7">Effects of Pressure on Oxygen Transport <img class="m" src="images/ca.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="CP4_VIDEO_5be873fbe56d0" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video><br/><br/><b>Oxygen Transport</b></p>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported simultaneously, either dissolved in blood or combined with hemoglobin in red blood cells. Each 100 mL of normal arterial blood carries 0.3 mL of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma and 20 mL of oxygen in combination with hemoglobin. Large amounts of oxygen can be transported in the blood because oxygen combines easily with hemoglobin to form oxyhemoglobin:</p>
<p class="center2">O<sub>2</sub> + Hgb &#x2194; HgbO<sub>2</sub></p>
<p class="indent">The volume of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma is measured by the partial pressure of oxygen in the arteries (PaO<sub>2</sub>). The higher the PaO<sub>2</sub>, the greater the amount of oxygen dissolved. For example, at a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 10 mm Hg, 0.03 mL of oxygen is dissolved in 100 mL of plasma. At PaO<sub>2</sub> of 20 mm Hg, twice this amount is dissolved in plasma, and at PaO<sub>2</sub> of 100 mm Hg, 10 times this amount is dissolved. Therefore, the amount of dissolved oxygen is directly proportional to the partial pressure, regardless of how high the oxygen pressure becomes.</p>
<p class="indent">The amount of oxygen that combines with hemoglobin depends on both the amount of hemoglobin in the blood and on PaO<sub>2</sub>, although only up to a PaO<sub>2</sub> of about 150 mm Hg. This is measured as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;oxygen saturation:&lt;/b&gt; percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to oxygen">oxygen saturation</button></strong> (SaO<sub>2</sub>), the percentage of the O<sub>2</sub> that could be carried if all the hemoglobin held the maximum possible amount of O<sub>2</sub>. When the PaO<sub>2</sub> is 150 mm Hg, hemoglobin is 100% saturated and does not combine with any additional oxygen. When hemoglobin is 100% saturated, 1 g of hemoglobin combines with 1.34 mL of oxygen. Therefore, in a person with 14 g/dL of hemoglobin, each 100 mL of blood contains about 19 mL of oxygen associated with hemoglobin. If the PaO<sub>2</sub> is less than 150 mm Hg, the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen decreases. For example, at a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 100 mm Hg (normal value), saturation is 97%; at a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 40 mm Hg, saturation is 70%.</p>
<p class="h7">Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve</p>
<p class="nonindent">The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (<a href="#ct17-4">Chart&#x00A0;17-4</a>) shows the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and the percentage of saturation of oxygen (SaO<sub>2</sub>). The percentage of saturation can be affected by carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion concentration, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. An increase in these factors shifts the curve to the right, thus less oxygen is picked up in the lungs, but more oxygen is released to the tissues, if PaO<sub>2</sub> is unchanged. A decrease in these factors causes the curve to shift to the left, making the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin stronger. If the PaO<sub>2</sub> is still unchanged, more oxygen is picked up in the lungs, but less oxygen is given up to the tissues. The unusual shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is a distinct advantage to the patient for two reasons:</p>
<p class="NL1First"><span class="numah">1.</span>If the PaO<sub>2</sub> decreases from 100 to 80 mm Hg as a result of lung disease or heart disease, the hemoglobin of the arterial blood remains almost maximally saturated (94%), and the tissues do not suffer from hypoxia.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is marked to show three oxygen levels:</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span>Normal levels&#x2014;PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x003E;70 mm Hg</p>

<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The normal (middle) curve (N) shows that 75% saturation occurs at a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 40 mm Hg. If the curve shifts to the right (R), the same saturation (75%) occurs at the higher PaO<sub>2</sub> of 57 mm Hg. If the curve shifts to the left (L), 75% saturation occurs at a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 25 mm Hg.</p>

<p class="NL1Last"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page470" title="470"></span><span class="numah">2.</span>When the arterial blood passes into tissue capillaries and is exposed to the tissue tension of oxygen (about 40 mm Hg), hemoglobin gives up large quantities of oxygen for use by the tissues.</p>
<p class="indent">With a normal value for PaO<sub>2</sub> (80 to 100 mm Hg) and SaO<sub>2</sub> (95% to 98%), there is a 15% margin of excess oxygen available to the tissues. With a normal hemoglobin level of 15 mg/dL and a PaO<sub>2</sub> level of 40 mm Hg (SaO<sub>2</sub> 75%), there is adequate oxygen available for the tissues but no reserve for physiologic stresses that increase tissue oxygen demand. If a serious incident occurs (e.g., bronchospasm, aspiration, hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias) that reduces the intake of oxygen from the lungs, tissue hypoxia results.</p>
<p class="indent">An important consideration in the transport of oxygen is cardiac output, which determines the amount of oxygen delivered to the body and affects lung and tissue perfusion. If the cardiac output is normal (5 L/min), the amount of oxygen delivered to the body per minute is normal. Under normal conditions, only 250 mL of oxygen is used per minute, which is approximately 25% of available oxygen. The rest of the oxygen returns to the right side of the heart, and the PaO<sub>2</sub> of venous blood drops from 80 to 100 mm Hg to about 40 mm Hg. If cardiac output falls, however, the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues also falls and may be inadequate to meet the body&#x2019;s needs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Carbon Dioxide Transport</h6>
<p class="nonindent">At the same time that oxygen diffuses from the blood into the tissues, carbon dioxide diffuses from tissue cells to blood and is transported to the lungs for excretion. The amount of carbon dioxide in transit is one of the major determinants of the acid&#x2013;base balance of the body. Normally, only 6% of the venous carbon dioxide is removed in the lungs and enough remains in the arterial blood to exert a pressure of 40 mm Hg. Most of the carbon dioxide (90%) is carried by red blood cells; the small portion (5%) that remains dissolved in the plasma (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO<sub>2</sub>]) is the critical factor that determines carbon dioxide movement in or out of the blood.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the many processes involved in respiratory gas transport seem to occur in intermittent stages, the changes are rapid, simultaneous, and continuous.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neurologic Control of Ventilation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Resting respiration is the result of cyclic excitation of the respiratory muscles by the phrenic nerve. The rhythm of breathing is controlled by respiratory centers in the brain. The inspiratory and expiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons control the rate and depth of ventilation to meet the body&#x2019;s metabolic demands.</p>
<p class="indent">The apneustic center in the lower pons stimulates the inspiratory medullary center to promote deep, prolonged inspirations. The pneumotaxic center in the upper pons is thought to control the pattern of respirations.</p>
<p class="indent">Several groups of receptor sites assist in the brain&#x2019;s control of respiratory function. The central chemoreceptors, located in the medulla, respond to chemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, which result from chemical changes in the blood. These receptors respond to an increase or decrease in the pH and convey a message to the lungs to change the depth and then the rate of ventilation to correct the imbalance. The peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the aortic arch and the carotid arteries and respond first to changes in PaO<sub>2</sub>, then to partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and pH.</p>
<p class="indent">Mechanoreceptors in the lung include stretch, irritant, and juxtacapillary receptors, and respond to changes in resistance by altering breathing patterns to support optimal lung function. For example, the Hering&#x2013;Breuer reflex is activated by stretch receptors in the alveoli. When the lungs are distended, inspiration is inhibited; as a result, the lungs do not become overdistended.</p>
<p class="indent">Proprioceptors in the muscles and chest wall respond to body movements, causing an increase in ventilation. Thus, range-of-motion exercises in a patient who is immobile stimulate breathing. Finally, baroreceptors, also located in the aortic and carotid bodies, respond to an increase or decrease in arterial blood pressure and cause reflex hypoventilation or hyperventilation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s524"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A gradual decline in respiratory function begins in early to middle adulthood and affects the structure and function of the respiratory system. The vital capacity of the lungs and the strength of the respiratory muscles peak between 20 and 25 years of age and decrease thereafter. With aging (40 years and older), changes occur in the alveoli that reduce the surface area available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. At approximately 50 years of age, the alveoli begin to lose elasticity. A decrease in vital capacity occurs with the loss of chest wall mobility, which restricts the tidal flow of air. The amount of respiratory dead space increases with age. These changes result in a decreased diffusion capacity for oxygen with increasing age, producing lower oxygen levels in the arterial circulation. Older adults have a decreased ability to rapidly move air in and out of the lungs.</p>
<p class="indent">Gerontologic changes in the respiratory system are summarized in <a href="c17-sec02.xhtml#tt17-2">Table&#x00A0;17-2</a>. Despite these changes, in the absence of chronic pulmonary disease, older adults are able to carry out activities of daily living, but they may have decreased tolerance for, and require additional rest after, prolonged or vigorous activity.</p>
