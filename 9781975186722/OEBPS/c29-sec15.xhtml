<h4 class="h4" id="s1179"><img class="m" src="images/icon49.jpg" alt=""/> Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome that is characterized by microthromboses and bleeding. DIC may be precipitated by sepsis, trauma, cancer, shock, abruptio placentae, allergic reactions, and other conditions. Most cases are associated with infection or malignancy (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Levi &#x0026; Seligsohn, 2016</a>). The severity of DIC varies but it is potentially life-threatening.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1180">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Normal hemostatic mechanisms are altered in DIC. The inflammatory response generated by the underlying disease initiates the process of inflammation and coagulation within the vasculature. The normal anticoagulation pathways in the body are impaired, and fibrinolysis is suppressed allowing numerous small clots to form in the microcirculation. Coagulation time is initially normal; however, when platelets and clotting factors form microthrombi, coagulation fails. The result of these processes leads to both excessive clotting and bleeding (see <a href="#ff29-7">Fig. 29-7</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The clinical manifestations of DIC are primarily reflected in compromised organ function or failure. Decline in organ function is usually a result of excessive clot formation (with resultant ischemia to all or part of the organ) or, less often, of bleeding. The excessive clotting triggers the fibrinolytic system to release fibrin degradation products, which are potent anticoagulants, furthering the bleeding. The bleeding is characterized by low platelet and fibrinogen levels; prolonged PT, aPTT, and thrombin time; and elevated fibrin degradation products and D-dimers.</p>
<p class="indent">The mortality rate can exceed 80% in patients who develop severe DIC with ischemic thrombosis, frank hemorrhage, and MODS. Identification of patients who are at risk for DIC and recognition of the early clinical manifestations of this syndrome can result in prompt medical intervention, which may improve the prognosis. However, the primary prognostic factor is the ability to treat the underlying condition that precipitated DIC (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Levi &#x0026; Seligsohn, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1181">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the initial process of DIC, the patient may have no new symptoms&#x2014;the only manifestation being a progressive decrease in the platelet count. As the thrombosis becomes more extensive, the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of thrombosis in the organs involved. Then, as the clotting factors and platelets are consumed to form these thrombi, bleeding occurs. Initially, the bleeding is subtle, but it can develop into frank hemorrhage. Signs and symptoms depend on the organs involved and are listed in <a href="#ct29-10">Chart 29-10</a>. Patients with frank DIC may exhibit bleeding from mucous membranes and venipuncture sites as well as the GI and urinary tracts. Bleeding may range from minimal, occult internal bleeding to copious bleeding from multiple orifices.</p>

<p class="TABLEpLEGEND"><em>Note:</em> Signs of microvascular thrombosis are the result of an inappropriate activation of the coagulation system, causing thrombotic occlusion of small vessels within all body organs. As the clotting factors and platelets are consumed, signs of microvascular bleeding appear. This bleeding can quickly worsen, becoming frank hemorrhage. Treatment must be aimed at the underlying disorder so that the stimulus for the syndrome is diminished or arrested.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1182">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of DIC is frequently made based on laboratory tests that demonstrate the consumption of platelets and clotting factors (see <a href="#tt29-4">Table 29-4</a>). Although each test is useful in establishing the diagnosis of DIC, the specificity of each individual test is lacking. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis developed a highly sensitive and specific scoring system using platelet count, fibrin degradation products, PT, and fibrinogen level to diagnose DIC (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Levi &#x0026; Seligsohn, 2016</a>) (see <a href="#tt29-5">Table 29-5</a>). Additionally, this system is useful in predicting the severity of the disease and subsequent mortality. Additional tests, such as thromboelastography, can be performed at the bedside and can effectively assess platelet function and fibrinolytic activity. Studies suggest that assessment of the status of the coagulation system at the bedside of critically ill patients is more useful than using conventional laboratory tests (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Afzal &#x0026; Syed, 2017</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1183">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most critical factor in managing DIC is treatment of the underlying cause; until the cause is controlled, DIC will continue. Correcting the secondary effects of tissue ischemia by increasing tissue oxygenation, replacing fluids, correcting electrolyte abnormalities, and administering vasopressor medications is also important. When serious hemorrhage is present, depleted coagulation factors and platelets are replaced to promote normal hemostasis and reduce bleeding. The extent of hemorrhage and need for any invasive procedure are important considerations in determining the decision to provide transfusion support. Cryoprecipitate is given to replace fibrinogen and factors V and VII (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Levi &#x0026; Seligsohn, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of a heparin infusion to interrupt the thrombosis process is a controversial treatment strategy. Heparin may inhibit the formation of microthrombi and allow improved tissue perfusion to vital organs. Traditionally, heparin has been used in patients with predominantly thrombotic manifestations or in those in whom blood component replacement failed to reduce hemorrhage or increased fibrinogen and other clotting levels. When bleeding is absent, LMWH can be used to prevent VTE, while therapeutic doses may be used when severe thrombosis is predominant. Normalization of plasma fibrinogen and diminished signs of bleeding serve as evidence of heparin&#x2019;s effectiveness. Fibrinolytic inhibitors, such as aminocaproic acid, are not routinely used as they block the lysis of fibrin that is necessary to preserve tissue perfusion. If bleeding is profuse and there is evidence of extensive fibrinolysis, fibrinolytic inhibitors are used along with continuous infusion of IV heparin (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Levi &#x0026; Seligsohn, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Recombinant forms of thrombomodulin were believed to inactivate thrombin, the main culprit in inciting the coagulopathy that undergirds DIC. However, a systematic review of clinical trials found no improvement in mortality rates with patients with DIC who were prescribed recombinant thrombomodulin (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Murao &#x0026; Yamakawa, 2019</a>). All management strategies must be individualized to the specific patient, underlying cause of DIC, and response to interventions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1184">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses need to identify patients at risk for DIC (see previous discussion on precipitating factors). It is important to assess patients frequently and thoroughly for signs and symptoms of thrombi and bleeding and monitor for progression of these signs (see <a href="#ct29-10">Chart 29-10</a>). Laboratory values must be monitored frequently to assess for trends over time as well as for changes in values.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="c29-sec17.xhtml#ct29-11">Chart 29-11</a> describes care of the patient with DIC. Assessment and interventions should target potential sites of end-organ damage. As organs become ischemic from microthrombi, organ function diminishes; the kidneys, lungs, brain, and skin are particularly vulnerable. Lack of renal perfusion may result in acute tubular necrosis and kidney injury, sometimes requiring dialysis. Placement of a large-bore dialysis catheter is extremely hazardous for this patient population and should be accompanied by adequate platelet and plasma transfusions. Hepatic dysfunction is also relatively common, reflected in altered liver function tests, depleted albumin stores, and diminished synthesis of clotting factors. Respiratory function warrants careful monitoring and aggressive measures to diminish alveolar compromise. Suctioning should be performed as gently as possible to diminish the risk of additional bleeding. CNS involvement can be manifested as headache, visual changes, and alteration in level of consciousness.</p>
