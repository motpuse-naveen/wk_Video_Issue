<h4 class="h4" id="s851">Percutaneous Coronary Interventions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Invasive interventional procedures to treat CAD include PTCA and intracoronary stent implantation. These procedures are classified as <strong>percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs)</strong>, as they are performed through a skin puncture rather than a surgical incision.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s852">Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In <strong>percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)</strong>, a balloon-tipped catheter is used to open blocked <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page746" title="746"></span>coronary vessels and resolve ischemia. It is used in patients with angina and as an intervention for ACS. Catheter-based interventions can also be used to open blocked CABGs (see later discussion). The purpose of PTCA is to improve blood flow within a coronary artery by compressing the atheroma. The procedure is attempted when the interventional cardiologist determines that PTCA can improve blood flow to the myocardium.</p>

<p class="Box12pTitlen">Promoting Health After Myocardial Infarction and Other Acute Coronary Syndromes</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">To extend and improve the quality of life, a patient who has had a myocardial infarction (MI) must make lifestyle adjustments to promote heart-healthy living. With this in mind, the nurse and patient develop a program to help achieve desired outcomes.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Making Lifestyle Modifications during Convalescence and Healing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Adaptation to an MI is an ongoing process and usually requires some modification of lifestyle. Educate patients to make the following specific modifications:</p>
<p class="Box15BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid any activity that produces chest pain, extreme dyspnea, or undue fatigue.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid extremes of heat and cold and walking against the wind.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lose weight, if indicated.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Stop smoking and the use of tobacco; avoid secondhand smoke.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Develop heart-healthy eating patterns and avoid large meals and hurrying while eating.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Modify meals to align with the AHA dietary recommendations, the Mediterranean diet, or other recommended diets.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Adhere to medical regimen, especially in taking medications.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Follow recommendations that ensure that blood pressure and blood glucose are in control.</p>
<p class="Box15BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Pursue activities that relieve and reduce stress.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Adopting an Activity Program</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">In addition, the patient needs to undertake a structured program of activity and exercise for long-term rehabilitation. Advise patients to:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Engage in a regimen of physical conditioning with a gradual increase in activity duration and then a gradual increase in activity intensity.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Enroll in a cardiac rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Walk daily, increasing distance and time as prescribed.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Monitor pulse rate during physical activity.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid physical exercise immediately after a meal.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Alternate activity with rest periods (some fatigue is normal and expected during convalescence).</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Participate in a daily program of exercise that develops into a program of regular exercise for a lifetime.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Managing Symptoms</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The patient must learn to recognize and take appropriate action for recurrent symptoms. Make sure that patients know to do the following:</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Call 911 if chest pressure or pain (or prodromal symptoms) is not relieved in 15 minutes by taking 3 nitroglycerin tablets at 5-minute intervals.</p>
<p class="Box3BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Contact the primary provider if any of the following occur: shortness of breath, fainting, slow or rapid heartbeat, swelling of feet and ankles.</p>

<p class="indent">PTCA is carried out in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Hollow catheters called <em>sheaths</em> are inserted, usually in the femoral artery (and sometimes the radial artery), providing a conduit for other catheters. Catheters are then threaded through the femoral or radial artery, up through the aorta, and into the coronary arteries. Angiography is performed using injected radiopaque contrast agents (commonly called <em>dye</em>) to identify the location and extent of the blockage. A balloon-tipped dilation catheter is passed through the sheath and positioned over the lesion. The physician determines the catheter position by examining markers on the balloon that can be seen with fluoroscopy. When the catheter is properly positioned, the balloon is inflated with high pressure for several seconds and then deflated. The pressure compresses and often &#x201C;cracks&#x201D; the atheroma (see <a href="#ff23-7">Fig. 23-7</a>). The media and adventitia of the coronary artery are also stretched.</p>
<p class="indent">Several inflations with different balloon sizes may be required to achieve the goal, usually defined as an improvement in blood flow and a residual stenosis of less than 10% (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Other measures of the success of PTCA are an increase in the artery&#x2019;s lumen and no clinically obvious arterial trauma. Because the blood supply to the coronary artery decreases while the balloon is inflated, the patient may complain of chest pain and the ECG may display ST-segment changes. Intracoronary stents are usually positioned in the intima of the vessel to maintain patency of the artery after the balloon is withdrawn.</p>
<p class="indent">If thick, deep, or concentric calcification is present, the lesion may require the use of devices such as cutting, scoring, or high pressure balloons, rotational atherectomy, orbital atherectomy and excimer lasers to prepare the lesion for stenting (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Shlofmitz, Shlofmitz, &#x0026; Lee, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these approaches, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is currently being investigated to treat calcified artery blockages with sonic pressure waves in a similar way that is used to treat kidney stones. Pulsatile sonic pressure waves are used during balloon inflation to fracture both intimal and medial calcium in the artery wall but pass through the surrounding soft vascular tissue in a safe manner. This technology is approved for use in peripheral arteries at this time. Further studies are being done to assess their efficacy in coronary arteries (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1787">Riley, Corl, &#x0026; Kereiakes, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s853">Coronary Artery Stent</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After PTCA, the area that has been treated may close off partially or completely&#x2014;a process called <em>restenosis.</em> The intima of the coronary artery has been injured and responds by initiating an acute inflammatory process. This process may include release of mediators that leads to vasoconstriction, clotting, and scar tissue formation. A coronary artery stent may be placed to overcome these risks. A <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stent:&lt;/b&gt; a metal mesh that provides structural support to a coronary vessel, preventing its closure">stent</button></strong> is a metal mesh that provides structural support to a vessel at risk of acute closure. The stent is initially positioned over the angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the mesh expands and presses against the vessel wall, holding the artery open. The balloon is withdrawn, but the stent is left permanently in place within the artery (see <a href="#ff23-7">Fig. 23-7</a>). Eventually, endothelium covers the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page747" title="747"></span>stent and it is incorporated into the vessel wall. The original stents do not contain medications and are known as bare metal stents. Some stents are coated with medications, such as sirolimus or paclitaxel, which may minimize the formation of thrombi or scar tissue within the coronary artery lesion. These drug-eluting stents (DES) have increased the success of PCI (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1771">Mishra, Edla, Tripathi, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Because of the risk of thrombus formation within the stent, the patient receives antiplatelet medications, usually aspirin and clopidogrel. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and clopidogrel is continued for 1 year following stent placement (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s854">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Complications that can occur during a PCI procedure include coronary artery dissection, perforation, abrupt closure, or vasospasm. Additional complications include acute MI, serious arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), and cardiac arrest. Some of these complications may require emergency surgical treatment. Complications after the procedure may include abrupt closure of the coronary artery and a variety of vascular complications, such as bleeding at the insertion site, retroperitoneal bleeding, hematoma, and arterial occlusion (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). In addition, there is a risk of acute kidney injury from the contrast agent used during the procedure (see <a href="#tt23-3">Table 23-3</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s855">Postprocedure Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patient care is similar to that for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization (see <a href="c21.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>). Patients who are not already hospitalized are admitted the day of the PCI. Those with no complications go home the same day. When the PCI is performed emergently to treat ACS, patients typically go to a critical care unit and stay in the hospital for a few days. During the PCI, patients receive IV heparin or a thrombin inhibitor (e.g., bivalirudin) and are monitored closely for signs of bleeding. Patients may also receive a GP IIb/IIIa agent (e.g., eptifibatide) for several hours following the PCI to prevent platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in the coronary artery (<a href="c23-sec07.xhtml#bib1746">Urden et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Hemostasis is achieved, and femoral sheaths may be removed at the end of the procedure by using a vascular closure device (e.g., Angio-Seal, VasoSeal) or a device that sutures the vessels. Hemostasis after sheath removal may also be achieved by direct manual pressure, a mechanical compression device (e.g., C-shaped clamp), or a pneumatic compression device (e.g., FemoStop).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients may return to the nursing unit with the large peripheral vascular access sheaths in place. The sheaths are then removed after blood studies (e.g., activated clotting time) indicate that the heparin is no longer active and the clotting time is within an acceptable range. This usually takes a few hours, depending on the amount of heparin given during the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page748" title="748"></span>procedure. The patient must remain flat in bed and keep the affected leg straight until the sheaths are removed and then for a few hours afterward to maintain hemostasis. Because immobility and bed rest may cause discomfort, treatment may include analgesics and sedation. Nonpharmacologic interventions include repositioning and heat application for back pain. Sheath removal and the application of pressure on the vessel insertion site may cause the heart rate to slow and the blood pressure to decrease (vasovagal response). A dose of IV atropine is usually given to treat this response.</p>

<p class="indent">Some patients with unstable lesions and at high risk for abrupt vessel closure are restarted on heparin after sheath removal, or they receive an IV infusion of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. These patients are monitored closely and may have a delayed recovery period.</p>
<p class="indent">After hemostasis is achieved, a pressure dressing is applied to the site. Patients resume self-care and ambulate unassisted within a few hours of the procedure. The duration of immobilization depends on the size of the sheath inserted, the type of anticoagulant given, the method of hemostasis, the patient&#x2019;s condition, and the physician&#x2019;s preference. On the day after the procedure, the site is inspected and the dressing removed. The patient is instructed to monitor the site for bleeding or development of a hard mass indicative of hematoma.</p>
