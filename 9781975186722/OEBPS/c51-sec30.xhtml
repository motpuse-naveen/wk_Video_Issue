<h4 class="h4" id="s2416">Hysterectomy</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hysterectomy:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of the uterus">Hysterectomy</button></strong> is the surgical removal of the uterus to treat cancer, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, nonmalignant growths, persistent pain, pelvic relaxation and prolapse, and previous injury to the uterus. Hysterectomies have been steadily declining over the last decade as the number of other therapeutic options (i.e., laser therapy, endometrial ablation, UAE, medications to shrink fibroid tumors) has increased (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3726">Morgan, Kamdar, Swenson, et al., 2017</a>). Despite the decline in hysterectomies, it is still the second most common gynecologic procedure; 90% of all hysterectomies are for benign causes (ACOG, 2017d).</p>
<p class="indent">A total hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus and the cervix. Hysterectomy can be supracervical or subtotal, in which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. Radical hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus as well as the surrounding tissue, including the upper third of the vagina and pelvic lymph nodes. The procedure can be performed through the vagina, through an abdominal incision, or laparoscopically (in which the uterus is removed in sections through small incisions using a laparoscope). Malignant conditions usually require a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>
<p class="indent">A laparoscopically assisted approach can also be used for vaginal hysterectomy. This procedure is performed as a short-stay procedure or ambulatory surgery in patients who are carefully selected. Robot-assisted hysterectomies are performed in more than 20% of cases, with similar outcomes compared to laparoscopic and vaginal methods at a higher cost (ACOG, 2017d).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2417">Preoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients are advised to discontinue anticoagulant medications, NSAIDs such as aspirin, and vitamin E prior to surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding. Pregnancy is ruled out on the day of surgery. Prophylactic antibiotic agents may be given prior to surgery and discontinued the next day. Prevention of thromboembolic events is critical, and methods depend on the risk profile of the patient.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2418">Postoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The principles of general postoperative care for abdominal surgery apply. Major risks are infection and hemorrhage. In addition, because the surgical site is close to the bladder, voiding problems may occur, particularly after a vaginal hysterectomy. Edema or nerve trauma may cause temporary bladder atony (loss of bladder tone), and an indwelling catheter may be inserted.</p>

<p class="processptitleph1_1" id="nurse44"><strong>The Patient Undergoing a Hysterectomy</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;assessment:&lt;/b&gt; the systematic collection of data, through interview, observation, and examination, to determine the patient&#x2019;s health status and any actual or potential problems">Assessment</button></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The health history and the physical and pelvic examination are completed, and laboratory tests are performed. Additional assessment data include the patient&#x2019;s psychosocial responses, because the need for a hysterectomy may elicit strong emotional reactions. If the hysterectomy is performed to remove a malignant tumor, anxiety related to fear of cancer and its consequences adds to the stress of the patient and her family. Women who have had a hysterectomy may be at risk for psychological and physical symptoms. Alternatively, women may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1703" title="1703"></span>note improved physical and mental health after hysterectomy as troublesome symptoms may be alleviated.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>N<small>URSING</small> D<small>IAGNOSES</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Anxiety associated with the diagnosis of cancer, fear of pain, possible perception of loss of femininity or childbearing potential</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disturbed body image associated with altered body function</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Acute pain associated with surgery and other adjuvant therapy</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Lack of knowledge of the perioperative aspects of hysterectomy and postoperative self-care</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>C<small>OLLABORATIVE</small> P<small>ROBLEMS</small>/P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hemorrhage</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>VTE</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Bladder dysfunction</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Infection</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals may include relief of anxiety, acceptance of loss of the uterus, absence of pain or discomfort, increased knowledge of self-care requirements, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Anxiety stems from several factors: unfamiliar environment; the effects of surgery on body image and reproductive ability; fear of pain and other discomfort; and, possibly, feelings of embarrassment about exposure in the perioperative period. The nurse determines what the experience means to the patient and encourages her to verbalize her concerns. Throughout the preoperative, postoperative, and recovery periods, explanations are given about physical preparations and procedures that are performed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>I<small>MPROVING</small> B<small>ODY</small> I<small>MAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient may have strong emotional reactions to having a hysterectomy and personal feelings related to the diagnosis, views of significant others who may be involved (family, partner), religious beliefs, and fears about prognosis. Concerns such as the inability to have children and the effect on femininity may surface, as may questions about the effects of surgery on sexual relationships, function, and satisfaction. The patient needs reassurance that she will still have a vagina and that she can experience sexual activity after temporary postoperative abstinence while tissues heal. Information that sexual satisfaction and orgasm arise from clitoral stimulation rather than from the uterus reassures many women. Most women note some change in sexual feelings after hysterectomy, but they vary in intensity. In some cases, the vagina is shortened by surgery, and this may affect sensitivity or comfort.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When hormonal balance is upset, as often occurs with reproductive system disorders, the patient may experience depressed mood and heightened emotional sensitivity to people and situations. The nurse needs to approach and evaluate each patient individually in light of these factors. A nurse who exhibits interest, concern, and willingness to listen to the patient&#x2019;s fears will help the patient progress through the surgical experience.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Postoperative pain and discomfort are common. Therefore, the nurse assesses the intensity of the patient&#x2019;s pain and assists the patient with analgesia as prescribed. If the patient has abdominal distention or flatus, a rectal tube and application of heat to the abdomen may be prescribed. When abdominal auscultation reveals return of bowel sounds and peristalsis, additional fluids and a soft diet are permitted. Early ambulation facilitates the return of normal peristalsis.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>A<small>DDRESSING</small> L<small>EARNING</small> N<small>EEDS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Patient education should address learning needs specific to the surgical procedure being performed. Research indicates that women undergoing robotic or laparoscopic surgeries have different learning needs (<a href="c51-sec31.xhtml#bib3721">Kurt, Loerzel, Hines, et al., 2018</a>). See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct51-9">Chart&#x00A0;51-9</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Gynecologic Surgery Learning Needs</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Kurt, G., Loerzel, V. W., Hines, R. B., et al. (2018). Learning needs of women who undergo robotic versus open gynecologic surgery. <em>Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing: JOGNN</em>, <em>47</em>(4), 490&#x2013;497.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the specific learning needs of women who undergo open gynecologic surgery via laparotomy or robotic surgery.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study used a descriptive exploratory design. The sample consisted of 226 women who underwent laparotomy (<em>n</em> = 71) or robotic surgery (<em>n</em> = 155) in one hospital. Participants were 18 years of age or older, able to speak, understand and read English or Spanish and scheduled for a laparotomy or robotic surgical procedure. Learning needs were measured using a 50-item patient learning needs scale (PLNS).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Study findings reported that at the time of discharge, participants in the robotic surgery group had significantly more learning needs overall on the PLNS, with means of 179.67 in the group that had robotic surgery compared to 159.66 in the group that had laparotomy (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001). Specifically, learning needs were greater in the topics of medications, activities of daily living, feelings related to condition, treatment and complications, skin care, and enhancing quality of life.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses need to be proactive in educating women about postoperative care following robotic surgery for gynecologic conditions. Nurses caring for these women should consider providing education earlier in the surgical process, ideally prior to surgery. A learning needs assessment done prior to surgery will help the nurse develop an individualized education plan.</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">Patient education also addresses the outcomes of surgery, possible feelings of loss, and options for management of any symptoms that occur. Women vary in their preferences for information and participation in decision making, including choice of treatment options, accurate and useful information at the appropriate time, support from their health care providers, and access to professional and lay support systems.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2_1"><strong>Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>H<small>EMORRHAGE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Vaginal bleeding and hemorrhage may occur after hysterectomy. To detect these complications early, the nurse counts the perineal pads used or checks the incision site, assesses the extent of saturation with blood, and monitors vital signs. Abdominal dressings are monitored for drainage if an abdominal surgical approach has been used. In preparation for hospital discharge, the nurse gives prescribed guidelines for activity restrictions to promote healing and to prevent postoperative bleeding. Because many women may go home the day of surgery or within a day or two, they are instructed to contact the nurse or surgeon if bleeding is beyond what is expected, which should be minimal.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>V<small>ENOUS</small> T<small>HROMBOEMBOLISM</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because of positioning during surgery, postoperative edema, and decreased activity postoperatively, the patient is at risk for DVT and PE. To minimize the risk, anti-embolism stockings are applied. In addition, the patient is encouraged and assisted to change positions frequently, although pressure under the knees is avoided, and to exercise her legs and feet while in bed. The nurse helps the patient ambulate early in the postoperative period. The nurse also assesses for DVT (leg pain, redness, warmth, edema) and PE (chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea). If the patient is being discharged home soon after surgery, she is instructed to avoid prolonged sitting in a chair with pressure at the knees, sitting with crossed legs, and inactivity. Furthermore, she is instructed to contact her primary provider if symptoms of DVT or PE occur.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>B<small>LADDER</small> D<small>YSFUNCTION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Because of possible difficulty in voiding postoperatively, occasionally an indwelling catheter may be inserted before or during surgery and is left in place in the immediate postoperative period. If a catheter is in place, it is usually removed shortly after the patient begins to ambulate. After the catheter is removed, urinary output is monitored; additionally, the abdomen is assessed for distention. If the patient does not void within a prescribed time, measures are initiated to encourage voiding (e.g., assisting the patient to the bathroom, pouring warm water over the perineum). If the patient cannot void, catheterization may be necessary. On rare occasions, the patient may be discharged home with the catheter in place and is instructed in its management.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="img-1" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> <span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The information provided to the patient is tailored to her needs. She must know what limitations or restrictions, if any, to expect. She is instructed to check the surgical incision daily and to contact her primary provider if redness or purulent drainage or discharge occurs. She is reminded that her periods are now over but that she may have a slightly bloody discharge for a few days; if bleeding recurs after this time, it should be reported immediately. The patient is educated about the importance of an adequate oral intake and of maintaining bowel and urinary tract function. The patient is informed that she is likely to recover quickly but that postoperative fatigue is not unusual.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The patient should resume activities gradually. This does not mean sitting for long periods, because doing so may cause blood to pool in the pelvis, increasing the risk of VTE. The nurse explains that showers are preferable to tub baths to reduce the possibility of infection and to avoid the dangers of injury that may occur when getting in and out of the bathtub. The patient is instructed to avoid straining, lifting, having penile&#x2013;vaginal intercourse, or driving until permitted. Vaginal discharge, foul odor, excessive bleeding, any leg redness or pain, or an elevated temperature should be reported, and the nurse reinforces education regarding activities and restrictions.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><span class="h4a">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> Follow-up telephone contact provides the nurse with the opportunity to determine whether the patient is recovering without problems and to answer any questions that may have arisen. The patient is reminded about postoperative follow-up appointments. If the patient&#x2019;s ovaries were removed and she finds vasomotor symptoms troublesome, hormone therapy may be considered at a low dose for a short amount of time. The patient is reminded to discuss risks and benefits of hormone therapy and alternative therapies with her primary provider and gynecologic care provider. Decisions about use of hormone therapy need to be made individually in consultation with these providers.</p>
