<h4 class="h4" id="s2525">The Patient Undergoing Prostate Surgery</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Prostate surgery may be indicated for the patient with BPH or prostate cancer. The objectives before prostate surgery are to assess the patient&#x2019;s general health status and to establish optimal kidney function. Prostate surgery should be performed before acute urinary retention develops and damages the upper urinary tract and collecting system or, in the case of prostate cancer, before cancer progresses.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2526">Surgical Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several approaches can be used to remove the hypertrophied portion of the prostate gland: TURP, suprapubic prostatectomy, perineal prostatectomy, retropubic prostatectomy, TUIP, and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (see <span class="chart"><a href="#tt53-4">Table&#x00A0;53-4</a></span>). With these approaches, all cancerous or hyperplastic tissue is removed, leaving behind only the capsule of the prostate.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transurethral Resection of the Prostate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">TURP, which is the most common procedure used, can be carried out through endoscopy. The prostate gland is removed in small chips with an electrical cutting loop (see <a href="#ff53-4">Fig.&#x00A0;53-4</a>A). This procedure decreases the risk of transurethral resection syndrome (hyponatremia, hypervolemia). Transurethral resection syndrome is a potential but rare complication of TURP that occurs in approximately 2% of men who undergo the procedure (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Hahn, 2019</a>) (see <a href="#ct53-4">Chart&#x00A0;53-4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Urethral strictures are more frequent than with nontransurethral procedures, and repeated procedures may be necessary because the residual prostatic tissue grows back. TURP rarely causes erectile dysfunction but may trigger retrograde ejaculation, because removal of prostatic tissue at the bladder neck can cause the seminal fluid to flow backward into the bladder rather than forward through the urethra during ejaculation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Suprapubic Prostatectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A suprapubic prostatectomy is an open surgical procedure (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-4">Fig.&#x00A0;53-4</a>B</span>). Disadvantages include blood loss, the need for an abdominal incision, and the risks associated with any major abdominal surgical procedure.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Perineal Prostatectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A perineal prostatectomy (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-4">Fig.&#x00A0;53-4</a>C</span>) is practical when other approaches are not possible and is useful for an open biopsy. However, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and rectal injury are more likely to occur with this approach.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Retropubic Prostatectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Retropubic prostatectomy is used more commonly than the suprapubic approach (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-4">Fig.&#x00A0;53-4</a>D</span>). This procedure is suitable for large glands located high in the pelvis. Although blood loss can be better controlled and the surgical site is easier to visualize, infections can readily start in the retropubic space.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Transurethral Incision of the Prostate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">TUIP is indicated when the prostate gland is small (30 g or less), and it is an effective treatment for many cases of BPH (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-4">Fig.&#x00A0;53-4</a>E</span>). TUIP can be performed as an outpatient procedure and has a lower complication rate than other more invasive prostate procedures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A laparoscopic radical prostatectomy has fewer risks compared with open radical prostatectomy (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Smith et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a minimally invasive approach that uses a computer console and a robot to move instruments, replicating the movements of the surgeon&#x2019;s hands (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3880">Peard, Goodwin, Hensley, et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Smith et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is not always performed. It may be used in some patients to provide information for staging the tumor and to remove an area of microscopic metastasis. The planned treatment may influence the surgeon&#x2019;s decision to perform PLND and the extent (limited vs. extended) of the dissection. Dissection of nodes anterior and lateral to the external iliac vessels is associated with an increased risk of lymphedema (NCCN, 2020a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2527">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative complications depend on the type of prostatectomy performed and may include hemorrhage, clot formation, catheter obstruction, and sexual dysfunction. All prostatectomies carry a risk of erectile dysfunction because of potential damage to the pudendal nerves. In most instances, sexual activity may be resumed in 6 to 8 weeks, which is the time required for the prostatic fossa to heal. The anatomic changes in the posterior urethra can lead to retrograde ejaculation. During ejaculation, the seminal fluid goes into the bladder and is excreted with the urine. A vasectomy may be performed during surgery to prevent infection from spreading from the prostatic urethra through the vas and into the epididymis.</p>
<p class="indent">After total prostatectomy (usually for cancer), the risk of erectile dysfunction is high. If this is unacceptable to the patient, options are available to produce erections sufficient for sexual activity: prosthetic penile implants, negative-pressure (vacuum) devices, and pharmacologic interventions (see earlier discussion and <a href="c53-sec04.xhtml#tt53-2">Table&#x00A0;53-2</a>).</p>

<p class="processppara">The nurse assesses how the underlying disorder (BPH or prostate cancer) has affected the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle. Questions to ask during assessment include the following: Has the patient&#x2019;s activity level or activity tolerance changed? What is his presenting urinary problem (described in the patient&#x2019;s own words)? Has he experienced decreased force of urinary flow, decreased ability to initiate voiding, urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, urinary retention, or hematuria? Does the patient report back pain, flank pain, and lower abdominal or suprapubic discomfort? Possible causes of such discomfort include infection, retention, and renal colic. Has the patient experienced erectile dysfunction or changes in frequency or enjoyment of sexual activity?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse obtains further information about the patient&#x2019;s family history of cancer and heart or kidney disease, including hypertension. Has he lost weight? Does he appear pale? Can he raise himself out of bed and return to bed without assistance? Can he perform usual activities of daily living? A comprehensive functional assessment helps determine how soon the patient will be able to return to normal activities after prostatectomy.</p>

<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major preoperative goals for the patient may include reduced anxiety and learning about his prostate disorder and the perioperative experience. The major postoperative goals may include maintenance of fluid volume balance, relief of pain and discomfort, ability to perform self-care activities, and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Preoperative Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>R<small>EDUCING</small> A<small>NXIETY</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The patient is usually admitted to the hospital or surgical center on the morning of surgery. Because contact with the patient may be limited before surgery, the nurse must establish communication with the patient to assess his understanding of the diagnosis and of the planned surgical procedure. The nature of the surgery and expected postoperative outcomes are clarified. In addition, the nurse familiarizes the patient with the pre- and postoperative routines and initiates measures to reduce anxiety. Because the patient may be sensitive and embarrassed discussing problems related to the genitalia and sexuality, the nurse provides privacy and establishes a trusting and professional relationship. The patient is encouraged to verbalize his feelings and concerns.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> D<small>ISCOMFORT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">If the patient experiences discomfort before surgery, bed rest may be prescribed, analgesic agents are given, and measures are initiated to relieve anxiety. If he is hospitalized, the nurse monitors his voiding patterns, watches for bladder distention, and assists with catheterization if indicated. An indwelling catheter is inserted if the patient has continuing urinary retention or if close monitoring is needed because of laboratory test results that indicate azotemia. The catheter can help decompress the bladder gradually over several days, especially if the patient is an older adult and hypertensive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1766" title="1766"></span>and has diminished kidney function or urinary retention that has existed for many weeks. For a few days after the bladder begins draining, the blood pressure may fluctuate, and kidney function may decline. If the patient cannot tolerate a urinary catheter, he is prepared for a cystostomy and insertion of a suprapubic catheter.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROVIDING</small> E<small>DUCATION</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">Before surgery, the nurse reviews with the patient the anatomy of the affected structures and their function in relation to the urinary and reproductive systems, using diagrams and other educational aids as indicated. Web-based prostate cancer education both before and after surgery, along with phone and internet communication, promotes self-care management and support for patients, their partners, and families (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Meyer, 2020</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Remacle, 2019</a>). This education can occur during the preadmission testing visit, with the nurse in prescribed settings, or in the urologist&#x2019;s office. The nurse explains what will take place while the patient is prepared for diagnostic tests and then for surgery (depending on the type of prostatectomy planned). The nurse also reinforces information given by the surgeon about the type of incision, which varies with the surgical approach (see <span class="chart"><a href="#tt53-4">Table&#x00A0;53-4</a></span>), and describes the likely type of urinary drainage system (urethral or suprapubic) and the recovery room procedure. The amount of information given is based on the patient&#x2019;s needs and questions. The nurse explains procedures expected to occur during the immediate perioperative period; answers questions the patient, family, or significant other may have; and provides emotional support. In addition, the patient is given information about postoperative care and pain management.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>REPARING THE</small> P<small>ATIENT</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">If the patient is scheduled for a prostatectomy, the preoperative preparation described in <a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a> is provided. Antiembolism stockings are applied before surgery and are particularly important to prevent VTE if the patient is placed in a lithotomy position during surgery. An enema is usually given at home on the evening before surgery or on the morning of surgery to prevent postoperative straining, which can induce bleeding.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Postoperative Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3_0"><strong>M<small>AINTAINING</small> F<small>LUID</small> B<small>ALANCE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">During the postoperative period, the patient is at risk for deficient fluid volume because of the irrigation of the surgical site during and after surgery. With irrigation of the urinary catheter to prevent its obstruction by blood clots, fluid may be absorbed through the open surgical site and retained, increasing the risk of excessive fluid retention, fluid imbalance, and water intoxication. The urine output and the amount of fluid used for irrigation must be closely monitored to determine whether irrigation fluid is being retained and to ensure an adequate urine output. An intake and output record, including the amount of fluid used for irrigation, must be maintained. The patient is also monitored for electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyponatremia), increasing blood pressure, confusion, and respiratory distress. These signs and symptoms are documented and reported to the surgeon. The risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance is greater in older patients with preexisting cardiovascular or respiratory disease.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>R<small>ELIEVING</small> P<small>AIN</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After a prostatectomy, the patient is assisted to sit and dangle his legs over the side of the bed on the day of surgery. The next morning, he is assisted to ambulate. If pain is present, the cause and location are determined, and the severity of pain and discomfort is assessed (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>). The pain may be related to the incision or may be the result of excoriation of the skin at the catheter site. It may be in the flank area, indicating a kidney problem, or it may be caused by bladder spasms. Bladder irritability can initiate bleeding and result in clot formation, leading to urinary retention.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Patients experiencing bladder spasms may report urgency to void, a feeling of pressure or fullness in the bladder, and bleeding from the urethra around the catheter. Medications that relax the smooth muscles can help ease the spasms, which can be intermittent and severe; these medications include flavoxate and oxybutynin. Warm compresses to the pubis or sitz baths may also relieve the spasms.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse monitors the drainage tubing and irrigates the system as prescribed to relieve any obstruction that may cause discomfort. Usually, the catheter is irrigated with 50 mL of irrigating fluid at a time. It is important to make sure that the same amount is recovered in the drainage receptacle. Securing the catheter drainage tubing to the leg or abdomen can help decrease tension on the catheter and prevent bladder irritation. Discomfort may be caused by dressings that are too snug, saturated with drainage, or improperly placed. Analgesic agents are given as prescribed. The nurse notifies the primary provider if the analgesic medications do not relieve the patient&#x2019;s pain and obtains a prescription for new doses or different medications.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After the patient is ambulatory, he is encouraged to walk but not to sit for prolonged periods, because this increases intra-abdominal pressure and the possibility of discomfort and bleeding. Prune juice and stool softeners are provided to ease bowel movements and to prevent excessive straining. An enema, if prescribed, is given with caution to avoid rectal perforation.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>M<small>ONITORING AND</small> M<small>ANAGING</small> P<small>OTENTIAL</small> C<small>OMPLICATIONS</small></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">After prostatectomy, the patient is monitored for major complications such as hemorrhage, infection, VTE, catheter problems, and sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Hemorrhage.</span> Although patients are advised to discontinue all aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and platelet inhibitors 10 to 14 days before the surgery to prevent excessive bleeding, bleeding and hemorrhagic shock remain risks. The risk is increased with BPH because a hyperplastic prostate gland is very vascular. Bleeding may occur from the prostatic bed. Bleeding may also result in the formation of clots, which then obstruct urine flow. The drainage normally begins as reddish-pink and then clears to a light pink within 24 hours after surgery. Bright-red bleeding with increased viscosity and numerous clots usually indicates arterial bleeding. Venous blood appears darker and less viscous. Arterial hemorrhage usually requires surgical intervention (e.g., suturing or transurethral coagulation of bleeding vessels), whereas venous bleeding may be controlled by applying prescribed traction to the catheter so that the balloon holding the catheter in place applies pressure to the prostatic fossa. The surgeon applies traction by securely taping the catheter to the patient&#x2019;s thigh if <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1767" title="1767"></span>hemorrhage occurs. Less blood loss (150 mL) is expected with robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, compared to the 500 to 900 mL loss that may occur with open prostatectomy.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing management includes assistance in implementing strategies to stop the bleeding and to prevent or reverse hemorrhagic shock. If blood loss is extensive, fluids and blood component therapy may be given. If hemorrhagic shock occurs, treatments described in <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> are initiated.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing interventions include closely monitoring vital signs; administering medications, IV fluids, and blood component therapy as prescribed; maintaining an accurate record of intake and output; and carefully monitoring drainage to ensure adequate urine flow and patency of the drainage system. The patient who experiences hemorrhage and his family are often anxious and benefit from explanations and reassurance about the event and the procedures that are performed.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Infection.</span> After perineal prostatectomy, the surgeon usually changes the dressing on the first postoperative day. Further dressing changes may become the responsibility of the nurse in the inpatient setting or the home health nurse upon discharge. Careful aseptic technique is used because the potential for infection is great. Dressings can be held in place by a double-tailed, T-binder bandage or a padded athletic supporter.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Rectal thermometers, rectal tubes, and enemas are avoided because of the risk of injury and bleeding in the prostatic fossa. After the perineal sutures are removed, the perineum is cleansed as indicated. Sitz baths are also used to promote comfort and healing.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">UTIs and epididymitis are possible complications after prostatectomy. The patient is assessed for their occurrence; if they occur, the nurse administers antibiotic agents as prescribed. Because the risk of infection continues after discharge from the hospital, the patient and family need to be educated to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection (fever, chills, sweating, myalgia, dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency). The patient and family are instructed to contact the urologist if these symptoms occur.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Venous Thromboembolism.</span> Patients undergoing prostatectomy are at risk for VTE, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; therefore, the nurse assesses the patient frequently after surgery for manifestations of VTE. Early postoperative ambulation is essential to reduce the risk of VTE. Medical and nursing management of VTE is described in <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>. In addition, if the patient is at high risk for clot formation, additional antithrombotic interventions may be prescribed (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3862">Klaassen, Wallis, Lavall&#x00E9;e, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Potential Catheter Problems.</span> After TURP, the catheter must drain well; an obstructed catheter produces distention of the prostatic capsule and resultant hemorrhage. Furosemide may be prescribed to promote urination and initiate postoperative diuresis, thereby helping to keep the catheter patent.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse observes the lower abdomen to ensure that the catheter has not become blocked. A distinct, rounded swelling above the pubis is a manifestation of an overdistended bladder. If the nurse ascertains that the client&#x2019;s bladder is distended, a portable bladder scanner may be used to determine if urine retention is a problem (see <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>).</p>

<p class="processpparapindent">The drainage bag is monitored for bloody urine, and the dressings and surgical incision are examined for bleeding. The color of the urine is carefully noted and documented; a change in color from pink to amber indicates reduced bleeding. Blood pressure, pulse, and respirations are monitored and compared with baseline preoperative vital signs to detect hypotension. The nurse also observes the patient for restlessness, diaphoresis, pallor, any drop in blood pressure, and an increasing pulse rate.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Drainage of the bladder may be accomplished by gravity through a closed sterile drainage system. A three-way drainage system is useful in irrigating the bladder and preventing clot formation (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ff53-5">Fig.&#x00A0;53-5</a></span>). Continuous irrigation may be used with TURP. Some urologists leave an indwelling catheter attached to a dependent drainage system. Gentle irrigation of the catheter may be prescribed to remove any obstructing clots.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">If the patient complains of pain, the tubing is examined. The drainage system is irrigated with irrigating fluid (usually 50 mL), if indicated and prescribed, to clear any obstruction.</p>

<div class="content">
<p class="clinic-head">Quality and Safety Nursing Alert</p>
<p class="clinicaltext"><em>The amount of fluid recovered in the drainage bag must equal the amount of fluid instilled. Overdistention of the bladder should be avoided because it can induce secondary hemorrhage by stretching the coagulated blood vessels in the prostatic capsule.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="processpparapindent">To prevent traction on the bladder, the drainage tube (not the catheter) is secured to the inner thigh. If a cystostomy catheter is in place, it is secured to the abdomen. The nurse <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1768" title="1768"></span>explains the purpose of the catheter to the patient and assures him that the urge to void results from the presence of the catheter and from bladder spasms. Reassurance is given to the patient that medication (anticholinergics) will be given to control his bladder spasms. He is cautioned not to pull on the catheter, because this causes bleeding and subsequent catheter blockage, which leads to urinary retention.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">After the catheter is removed (usually when the urine appears clear), urine may leak around the wound for several days in the patient who has undergone perineal, suprapubic, or retropubic surgery. The cystostomy tube may be removed before or after the urethral catheter is removed. Some urinary incontinence may occur after catheter removal, and the patient is informed that this is likely to subside over time.</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Urinary Incontinence.</span> Postoperative urinary incontinence is a complication that can be reduced through the use of a surgical technique called puboprostatic ligament-sparing, or through the use of a male sling (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3888">Tasso, Beels, Del Favero, et al., 2020</a>). Even without these techniques, current surgical procedures have decreased the incidence of urinary incontinence following surgery. Factors associated with postoperative continence are younger age, preservation of both neurovascular bundles, absence of an anastomotic stricture, eversion of the bladder neck, and a smaller prostate volume. The nurse can encourage the patient who experiences incontinence to take steps to prevent incontinence, improve continence, anticipate leakage, and cope with lack of complete control (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Remacle, 2019</a>). Preventing incontinence involves increasing voiding frequency, avoiding positions that encourage the urge to void, and decreasing fluid intake prior to activities. Promoting continence involves pelvic floor exercises (see the Educating Patients About Self-Care section that follows), biofeedback, and electrical stimulation. Anticipating leakage may entail lifestyle modifications such as using absorbent pads and carrying extra clothes to prevent urinary incontinence; this can improve confidence when bathroom access is limited. It also helps to know the location of public bathrooms. Coping long term with complete lack of control may involve collagen injections, artificial sphincter implants, medications, and leg bags (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>; <a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Remacle, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4a"><span class="h4a">Sexual Dysfunction.</span> Depending on the type of surgery, the patient may experience sexual dysfunction related to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and fatigue. These issues may become a concern to the patient soon after surgery or in the weeks to months of rehabilitation. With nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, the likelihood of recovering the ability to have erections is better for men who are younger and men in whom both neurovascular bundles are spared. A decrease in libido is usually related to the impact of the surgery on the body. Reassurance that the usual level of libido will return after recuperation from surgery is often helpful to the patient and his partner. The patient should be aware that he may experience fatigue during rehabilitation from surgery. This fatigue may also decrease his libido and alter his enjoyment of usual activities.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Several options to restore erectile function are discussed with the patient by the surgeon or urologist. These options may include medications, surgically placed implants, or negative-pressure devices. PDE-5 inhibitors (see <span class="chart"><a href="c53-sec04.xhtml#tt53-3">Table&#x00A0;53-3</a></span>) may be effective for treatment of erectile dysfunction in men after radical prostatectomy, especially if the neurovascular bundles have been preserved. They may also improve erectile function in men with partial or moderate erectile dysfunction after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Nursing interventions include assessing for sexual dysfunction after surgery. Providing a private and confidential environment to discuss issues of sexuality is important. The emotional challenges of prostate surgery and its consequences need to be carefully explored with the patient and his partner. Providing the opportunity to discuss these issues can be very beneficial to the patient. For patients who have significant difficulty adjusting to sexual dysfunction, a referral to a sex therapist may be indicated.</p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<small>ROMOTING</small> H<small>OME</small>, C<small>OMMUNITY</small>-B<small>ASED, AND</small> T<small>RANSITIONAL</small> C<small>ARE</small></strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph4"><img class="img-1" src="images/icon10.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="h4a">Educating Patients About Self-Care.</span> The length of the hospital stay for the patient undergoing prostatectomy depends on the surgical approach used and ranges from 1 to 2 days for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy to 3 to 5 days for open prostatectomy. The patient and family require education about how to manage the drainage system, how to assess for complications, and how to promote recovery. The nurse provides verbal and written education about the need to maintain the drainage system and to monitor urinary output; about wound care; and about strategies to prevent complications, such as infection, bleeding, and thrombosis. In addition, the patient and family need to know about signs and symptoms that should be reported to the primary provider (e.g., blood in urine, decreased urine output, fever, change in wound drainage, calf tenderness).</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">As the patient recovers and drainage tubes are removed, he may become discouraged and depressed because he cannot regain bladder control immediately. Furthermore, urinary frequency and burning may occur after the catheter is removed. Educating the patient about the following exercises may help him regain urinary control:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Tense the perineal muscles by pressing the buttocks together, hold this position, and then relax. This exercise can be performed 10 to 20 times each hour while sitting or standing (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Brant, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Try to interrupt the urinary stream after starting to void; wait a few seconds and then continue to void.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Perineal exercises should continue until the patient gains full urinary control. The patient is educated to urinate as soon as he feels the first urge to do so. It is important to let the patient know that regaining urinary control is a gradual process; he may continue to &#x201C;dribble&#x201D; after being discharged from the hospital, but this should gradually diminish (usually within 1 year). The urine may be cloudy for several weeks after surgery but should clear as the prostate area heals.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">While the prostatic fossa heals (6 to 8 weeks), the patient should avoid activities that produce Valsalva effects (straining, heavy lifting) because they may increase venous pressure and produce hematuria. He should avoid long motor trips and strenuous exercise, which increase the tendency to bleed. He should also know that spicy foods, alcohol, and coffee may cause bladder discomfort. The patient should be cautioned to drink enough fluids to avoid dehydration, which increases the tendency for a blood clot to form and obstruct the flow of urine. Signs of complications, such as bleeding, passage of blood clots, a decrease in the urinary stream, urinary retention, or symptoms of UTIs, should be reported to the primary provider (see <span class="chart"><a href="#ct53-5">Chart&#x00A0;53-5</a></span>). Patients who have undergone robotic-assisted prostatectomy are often able to return to their usual activities in approximately 7 to 10 days (<a href="c53-sec22.xhtml#bib3902">Cheng et al., 2019</a>).</p>
