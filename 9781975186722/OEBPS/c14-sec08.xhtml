<h4 class="h4" id="s462">Nutritional and Fluid Status</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Optimal nutrition is an essential factor in promoting healing and resisting infection and other surgical complications. Assessment of a patient&#x2019;s nutritional status identifies factors that can affect the patient&#x2019;s surgical course, such as obesity, weight loss, malnutrition, deficiencies in specific nutrients, metabolic abnormalities, and the effects of medications on nutrition. Nutritional needs may be determined by measurement of BMI and waist circumference. (See <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for further discussion of nutritional assessment.)</p>
<p class="indent">Any nutritional deficiency should be corrected before surgery to provide adequate protein for tissue repair. The nutrients needed for wound healing are summarized in <a href="#tt14-2">Table&#x00A0;14-2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of a patient&#x2019;s hydration status is also essential. The patient&#x2019;s NPO (Nothing by Mouth or <em>nil per os</em>) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page403" title="403"></span>status should be confirmed preoperatively. Preoperative fasting helps prevent the risk of aspiration but it also induces stress on the body, including the loss of glycogen stores, and the body sacrifices lean muscle to meet the energy needs of the surgery. This may lead to dehydration, which may be exhibited day of surgery by low blood pressure or blood tests revealing fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The depletion of fluids and electrolytes following bowel preparation, especially when combined with prolonged fasting, can result in dehydration and chemical imbalances, even among healthy surgical patients.</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Genetics Concepts and Perioperative Nursing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Nurses who are caring for patients undergoing surgery need to take various genetic considerations into account when assessing patients throughout the operative experience. Genetic disorders can impact pre-, intra-, and postoperative surgical outcomes. In particular, consideration must be given to genetic disorders associated with the delivery of anesthesia as well as other genetic disorders that may increase the risk of postoperative complications. Examples of genetic conditions that may cause complications with anesthesia include the following:</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Autosomal Dominant</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Central core disease</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Malignant hyperthermia</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Examples of other genetic conditions that must be evaluated and are associated with perioperative risks include the following:</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Cystic fibrosis (autosomal recessive)</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (X-linked recessive)</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ehlers&#x2013;Danlos syndrome</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Factor V Leiden (autosomal dominant)</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Hemophilia (X-linked)</p>

<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Family History Assessment Specific to Genetics and Perioperative Nursing</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Obtain a thorough assessment of personal and family history for three generations, inquiring about prior problems with surgery or anesthesia with specific attention to complications, such as fever, rigidity, dark urine, and unexpected reactions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inquire about any history of musculoskeletal complaints, history of heat intolerance, fevers of unknown origin, or unusual drug reactions.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assess for family history of any sudden or unexplained death, especially during participation in athletic events.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assess whether any family members have been diagnosed with King&#x2013;Denborough syndrome, as this is a form of congenital myopathy that places the patient at risk for malignant hyperthermia.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH2">Patient Assessment Specific to Genetics and Perioperative Nursing</p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Identify the presence of other inherited genetic disorders that may impact surgical outcomes (e.g., inherited connective tissue, metabolic, bleeding, or neurologic disorders).</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assess for subclinical muscle weakness.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Assess for other physical features suggestive of an underlying genetic condition, such as contractures, kyphoscoliosis, and pterygium with progressive weakness.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Management Issues Specific to Genetics and Perioperative Nursing</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inquire as to whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on an affected family member.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, and availability of diagnostic/genetic testing.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s463">Dentition</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The condition of the mouth is an important health factor to assess. Dental caries, dentures, and partial plates are particularly significant to the anesthesiologist or CRNA, because decayed teeth or dental prostheses may become dislodged during intubation and occlude the airway. This is especially important for older patients as well as those who may not have regular dental care. The condition of the mouth is also important because any bodily infection, even in the mouth, can be a source of postoperative infection.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s464">Drug or Alcohol Use</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Excessive alcohol consumption can cause arrhythmias, infections, and withdrawal. These factors can lead to extended hospital stays and increased complications. Identifying patients who have excessive alcohol use presurgically and implementing interventions can reduce the incidence of complications by about 50% (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1238">Cuomo, Abate, Springer, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). In addition, the use of illicit drugs and alcohol may impede the effectiveness of some medications. Because acutely intoxicated people are susceptible to injury, surgery is postponed if possible. If surgery is required, local, spinal, or regional block anesthesia is used for minor surgery (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Norris, 2019</a>). In an emergency, to prevent vomiting and potential aspiration, a nasogastric tube is inserted before general anesthesia is given.</p>
<p class="indent">The person with a history of alcohol abuse often suffers from malnutrition and other systemic problems or metabolic imbalances that increase surgical risk. People who have a substance abuse problem may deny or attempt to hide it. In such situations, the nurse who is obtaining the patient&#x2019;s health history needs to ask frank questions with patience, care, and a nonjudgmental attitude. Such questions should include asking whether the patient has had two drinks per day or more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page404" title="404"></span>on a regular basis in the 2 weeks prior to surgery (see <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for an assessment of alcohol and drug use).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s465">Respiratory Status</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is educated about breathing exercises and the use of an incentive spirometer, if indicated, to achieve optimal respiratory function prior to surgery. The potential compromise of ventilation during all phases of surgical treatment necessitates a proactive response to respiratory infections. Surgery is usually postponed for elective cases if the patient has a respiratory infection. Patients with underlying respiratory disease (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are assessed carefully for current threats to their pulmonary status.</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperative smoking cessation interventions can be effective in changing smoking behavior and reducing the incidence of postoperative complications. Patients who smoke are more likely to experience poor wound healing, a higher incidence of SSI, and complications that include VTE and pneumonia. During the preoperative assessment, patients should be asked about current and previous tobacco use. The PAT visit is an optimal time to advocate for smoking cessation (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1238">Cuomo et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Patients undergoing elective cases may have their surgery delayed or cancelled due to the potential complications associated with smoking. Those at highest risk of complications are patients scheduled to receive artificial implants such as grafts, total joint replacements, or breast enhancements (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Devlin &#x0026; Smeltzer, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s466">Cardiovascular Status</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patient preparation for surgical intervention includes ensuring that the cardiovascular system can support the oxygen, fluid, and nutritional needs of the perioperative period. Patients are assessed for cardiac comorbidities including congestive heart failure, shortness of breath upon movement, and arrhythmias (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Clifford, 2018</a>). Preoperatively, patients may receive a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG) to rule out any undiagnosed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page405" title="405"></span>cardiac condition. Before surgery, the patient&#x2019;s baseline vital signs and blood pressure are taken. In elective situations, surgery may be postponed if there is evidence of cardiac decomposition or unexplained elevated blood pressure (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Phillips, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s467">Hepatic and Renal Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The presurgical goal is optimal function of the liver and urinary systems so that medications, anesthetic agents, body wastes, and toxins are adequately metabolized and removed from the body. The liver, lungs, and kidneys are the routes for elimination of drugs and toxins.</p>
<p class="indent">The liver is important in the biotransformation of anesthetic compounds. Disorders of the liver may substantially affect how anesthetic agents are metabolized. Acute liver disease is associated with high surgical mortality; preoperative improvement in liver function is a goal. Careful assessment may include various liver function tests (see <a href="c43.xhtml">Chapter 43</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The kidneys are involved in excreting anesthetic medications and their metabolites; therefore, surgery is contraindicated if a patient has acute nephritis, acute renal insufficiency with oliguria or anuria, or other acute renal problems (see <a href="c48.xhtml">Chapter 48</a>). Exceptions include surgeries performed as lifesaving measures, surgery to enable easier access for dialysis, or those necessary to improve urinary function (e.g., obstructive uropathy or hydronephrosis).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s468">Endocrine Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dysfunction of the endocrine system is associated with overproduction or underproduction of a hormone or hormones. This dysfunction may be the primary reason for surgery or it may coexist in patients who need surgery on other organ systems (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Odom-Forren, 2018</a>). Patients who have received corticosteroids are at risk for adrenal insufficiency. The use of corticosteroids for any purpose during the preceding year must be reported to the anesthesiologist or CRNA and surgeon. The patient is monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency (see <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with uncontrolled thyroid disorders are at risk for thyrotoxicosis (with hyperthyroid disorders) or respiratory failure (with hypothyroid disorders). The patient with an associated history of a thyroid disorder is assessed preoperatively (see <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with diabetes who is undergoing surgery is at risk for both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Hypoglycemia may develop during anesthesia or postoperatively from inadequate carbohydrates or excessive administration of insulin. Hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of SSI, may result from the stress of surgery, which can trigger increased levels of catecholamine. Other risks are acidosis and glucosuria. Although the surgical risk in the patient with controlled diabetes is no greater than in the patient without diabetes, strict glycemic control leads to better outcomes (ASPAN, 2019). Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is important before, during, and after surgery. (See <a href="c46.xhtml">Chapter 46</a> for a discussion of the patient with diabetes.)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s469">Immune Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An important function of the preoperative assessment is to determine the presence of infection or allergies. Routine laboratory tests used to detect infection include the white blood cell (WBC) and the urinalysis. Surgery may be postponed in the presence of infection or elevated temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to identify and document any sensitivity to medications, solutions, adhesives, and past adverse reactions (ASPAN, 2019). The patient is asked to identify any substances that precipitated previous allergic reactions, including medications, blood transfusions, contrast agents, latex, and food products, and to describe the signs and symptoms produced by these substances. A sample latex allergy screening questionnaire is shown in <a href="#ff14-2">Figure&#x00A0;14-2</a>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s470">Previous Medication Use</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A medication history is obtained because of the possible interactions with medications that might be given during surgery and the effects of any of these medications on the patient&#x2019;s perioperative course. Any medications the patient is using or has used in the past are documented, including OTC preparations and herbal agents, as well as the frequency with which they are used. Many medications have an effect on physiologic functions; interactions of such medications with anesthetic agents can cause serious problems, such as hypotension and circulatory collapse. Medications that cause particular concern are listed in <a href="#tt14-3">Table&#x00A0;14-3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Aspirin, clopidogrel, and other medications that inhibit platelet aggregation should be prudently discontinued 7 to 10 days before surgery; otherwise, the patient may be at increased risk for bleeding (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1260">Rothrock, 2019</a>). Any use of aspirin or other OTC medications is noted in the patient&#x2019;s medical record and conveyed to the intraoperative team. The anesthesia provider evaluates the potential effects of prior medication therapy, considering the length of time the patient has used the medication, the physical condition of the patient, and the nature of the proposed surgery.</p>

Commonly used herbal medications and supplements along with their indications for use and possible surgical risks can be found in <a href="#tt14-4">Table&#x00A0;14-4</a>. Additional herbal medications may include echinacea and licorice extract (<em>Glycyrrhizic acid</em>). Many patients fail to report the use of herbal medicines to health care service providers; therefore, the nurse must ask surgical patients specifically about the use of these agents. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page407" title="407"></span>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) issued a statement cautioning patients who take herbal products to refrain from taking them for at least 2 weeks before surgery (<a href="c14-sec12.xhtml#bib1229">American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA], 2017</a>).</p>
