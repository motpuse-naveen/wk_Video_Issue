<h4 class="h4a" id="s3209">HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Shock is a condition in which there is loss of effective circulating blood volume. Inadequate organ and tissue perfusion follows, ultimately resulting in cellular metabolic derangements. In any emergency situation, the onset of shock should be anticipated by immediately assessing all people who are injured. The underlying cause of shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, or septic) must be determined. Of these, hypovolemia is the most common cause. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for further discussion of management of hypovolemic shock.</p>
