<h4 class="h4" id="s1097">Hypoproliferative Anemias</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The hypoproliferative anemias include iron deficiency anemia, anemias in renal disease, anemia of inflammation, aplastic anemia, and megaloblastic anemias.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1098">Iron Deficiency Anemia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Iron deficiency anemia results when the intake of dietary iron is inadequate for synthesis of hemoglobin. The body is able to store about one fourth to one third of its iron requirements, and it is not until those stores are depleted that iron deficiency anemia develops. Iron deficiency anemia may occur when total body iron stores are adequate, but the amount of iron delivered to the erythroid precursors is inadequate. This is referred to as functional iron deficiency (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2136">Hashemi, Mashhadi, Mohammadi, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia in all age groups, and it is the most common form of anemia worldwide, affecting as many as one in eight people (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Bunn &#x0026; Heeney, 2017</a>). It is especially prevalent in developing countries where iron stores may be chronically depleted because of lack of sources for iron-rich foods and from blood loss associated with intestinal parasites (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Harper, Besa, &#x0026; Conrad, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Iron deficiency anemia is also common among adults in the United States, with the most common cause being blood loss. Blood loss should always be considered as the cause of iron deficiency anemia until proven otherwise. The most common cause of this anemia in men and postmenopausal women is GI bleeding from ulcers, gastritis, tumors, or inflammatory bowel disease. The most common causes of iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal women are menorrhagia (i.e., excessive menstrual bleeding) and pregnancy with inadequate iron intake. Patients with chronic alcohol abuse and patients who take aspirin, steroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may have chronic blood loss from the GI tract, leading to iron loss and subsequent anemia. Other causes include iron malabsorption, as seen after gastrectomy or bariatric surgery, or from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2135">Harper et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1099">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with iron deficiency primarily have symptoms of anemia. If the deficiency is severe or prolonged, they may also have a smooth, red tongue; brittle and ridged nails; and angular cheilosis. These signs subside after iron replacement therapy. The health history may be significant for multiple pregnancies, GI bleeding, and pica (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Camaschella, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1100">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The definitive method of establishing the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is bone marrow aspiration (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a> for further discussion of bone marrow aspiration). The aspirate is stained to detect iron, which is at a low level or even absent. However, few patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia undergo bone marrow aspiration. In many patients, the diagnosis can be established with other tests, particularly in patients with a history of conditions that predispose them to this type of anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">A strong correlation exists between laboratory values that measure iron stores and hemoglobin levels. After iron stores are depleted (as reflected by low serum ferritin levels), the hemoglobin level falls. The diminished iron stores cause small erythrocytes to be produced by the marrow. Therefore, as the anemia progresses, the MCV, which measures the size of the erythrocytes, also decreases. Hematocrit and RBC levels are also low in relation to the hemoglobin level. Other laboratory tests that measure iron stores are useful but not as precise as ferritin levels. Typically, patients with iron deficiency anemia have a low serum iron level and an elevated TIBC, which measures the transport protein supplying the marrow with iron as needed (also referred to as transferrin) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Camaschella, 2019</a>). However, other disease states, such as infection and inflammatory conditions, can also cause a low serum iron level and TIBC, as well as an elevated ferritin level. If these are suspected, measuring the soluble transferring receptor can aid in differentiating the cause of anemia. This test result will be increased in the setting of iron deficiency, but not in chronic inflammation (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Camaschella, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1101">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Oral iron supplementation is often the primary mode of treatment for iron deficiency anemia. Several oral iron preparations, including ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate, are available. Ferric maltol, another oral preparation, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 for use in iron deficiency anemia in those with inflammatory bowel disease. After taking oral iron preparations, hemoglobin typically begins to increase within a few weeks and the anemia may be corrected within a few months. Replenishing iron stores takes several months so it is important that patients continue taking oral iron supplements for 6 to 12 months. If oral iron is poorly absorbed or poorly tolerated, or large amounts of supplemental iron are needed, intravenous (IV) iron may be given in repeated doses (see <a href="#ct29-2">Chart 29-2</a>). Initial evidence has shown that ferric maltol is not inferior to parenteral iron and may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate other oral preparations or do not wish to have parenteral iron; however, it is unknown whether use of ferric maltol will decrease demands for parenteral iron preparations (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2135">Harper et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Parenteral Iron Formulations</strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Older formulations of parenteral iron had a high molecular weight and carried a significant risk for hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Newer formulations have a low molecular weight and a markedly lower risk for anaphylaxis.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ferric gluconate: Each 5 mL contains 62.5 mg of elemental iron; 125 mg is diluted in 100-mL normal saline and infused over 1 hour, or 5 mL undiluted is given as a slow IV push injection over 5 minutes. Although the likelihood of an allergic reaction is very low, a test dose is often given prior to the first infusion.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Iron sucrose: Each 5 mL contains 100 mg of elemental iron; 100 to 200 g can be given, undiluted, as a slow IV push over 2 to 5 minutes. This procedure can be repeated as often as every 3 days for a cumulative dose of 1000 mg within a 2-week period.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Ferumoxytol injection: The 17 mL vial is diluted in 50 to 200 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose and water and infused over 15 minutes. Close observation for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction, including monitoring blood pressure and pulse, is recommended.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1102">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preventive education is important for women who are menstruating and for those who are pregnant. Food sources rich in iron include organ meats (e.g., beef or calf&#x2019;s liver, chicken liver), other meats, beans (e.g., pinto, black, and garbanzo beans), leafy green vegetables, raisins, and molasses. Eating iron-rich foods with a source of vitamin C (e.g., orange juice) improves iron absorption.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assists the patient in selecting healthy diet options. Nutritional counseling can be provided for those who have an inadequate diet. Patients with history of strict vegetarian or other diets lacking in essential nutrients should be counseled about how to meet their dietary needs. The nurse also encourages the patient to continue the prescribed therapy for as long as needed to replenish iron stores even when fatigue and other symptoms have resolved.</p>
<p class="indent">Oral iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, making it important for patients to be instructed to take the supplement approximately 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. The least expensive, standard form of oral iron, ferrous sulfate, is tolerated by most patients. GI side effects, including constipation, cramping, nausea, and vomiting may result in difficulty adhering to the prescribed regimen. Decreasing the frequency of administration or taking iron supplements with food may reduce symptoms but will diminish iron absorption, thus, it may take longer to replete iron stores. Taking iron with vitamin C can enhance absorption, but it may also increase the frequency of side effects (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2137">Heffernan, Evans, Holmes, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Some iron formulations have been designed to limit GI side effects by adding stool softeners to reduce constipation or sustained release formulations to reduce gastritis and nausea. However, enteric-coated tablets may be poorly absorbed. Slow release formulations are absorbed beyond the duodenum; however, the duodenum is the site where maximum iron absorption takes place (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Auerbach &#x0026; Adamson, 2016</a>). Educational materials to assist patients with use of iron supplements are available (see <a href="#ct29-3">Chart 29-3</a>).</p>
<div class="box11a">
<p class="Box11pNumber" id="ct29-3"><strong>Chart 29-3 <img class="m" src="images/xxiv-1.png" alt=""/> PATIENT EDUCATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Taking Oral Iron Supplements</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="Box2BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Take iron on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal), preferably with orange juice or other source of vitamin C. Iron absorption is reduced by food, especially dairy products.</p>
<p class="Box2BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Reduce gastrointestinal distress by using the following schedule when more than one tablet per day is prescribed: Take one tablet per day for the first few days, then increase to two tablets per day, then three tablets per day in divided doses. This allows gradual adjustment to the iron. If unable to tolerate oral supplements due to gastrointestinal distress despite using this intervention, a reduced amount of iron may be used rather than stopping it completely. Reduced doses will require that the treatment duration is extended to adequately replenish iron stores.</p>
<p class="Box2BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Increase intake of foods rich in vitamin C to enhance iron absorption (citrus fruits and juices, strawberries, tomatoes, broccoli).</p>
<p class="Box2BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Note that stool will be dark in color and often appear black.</p>
<p class="Box2BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Eat foods high in fiber to reduce problems with constipation. A stool softener may be needed.</p>
<p class="Box2BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Be aware that liquid iron preparations may stain the teeth. They may be taken through a straw or by placing the spoon at the back of the mouth. Rinse the mouth thoroughly after each dose.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If taking iron on an empty stomach causes GI distress, the patient may need to take it with meals. However, this may reduce absorption by as much as 40%, therefore increasing the time needed to replenish iron stores. Antacids and dairy products should be avoided with iron as they can greatly diminish its absorption. Polysaccharide iron complex preparations are available. These reduce GI toxicity but are more expensive. Liquid forms of iron that cause less GI distress are also available. Oral iron replacement therapy may change the color of the stool but should not cause a false-positive result for occult blood on stool analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">IV supplementation may be used when the patient&#x2019;s iron stores are very low, if the patient cannot tolerate oral forms of iron, or both. The nurse must be aware of the type of parenteral formulation of iron ordered so that risk for anaphylaxis can be determined. High-molecular formulations are associated with a much higher risk for anaphylaxis and are seldom used. Administering a test dose of low-molecular formulations of iron dextran is recommended by many manufacturers. The nurse must assist the patient in understanding the need for repeated doses to replenish iron stores or to maintain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page916" title="916"></span>iron stores in the setting of chronic blood loss, such as hemodialysis or chronic GI bleeding.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1103">Anemias in Renal Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The degree of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can vary greatly; however, in general, patients do not become severely anemic until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Fishbane &#x0026; Spinowitz, 2018</a>). The symptoms of anemia may be the most troubling of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms. In patients with CKD, anemia contributes to increased cardiac output, reduced oxygen utilization, decreased cognition and ability to concentrate, reduced immune responsiveness, and reduced libido. Anemia may be more severe in patients with both CKD and diabetes (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Fishbane &#x0026; Spinowitz, 2018</a>). Anemia in patients with CKD is discussed in Chapter 48.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1104">Anemia of Inflammation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anemia of inflammation describes anemia associated with chronic diseases including inflammation, infection, and malignancy. This classification was previously known as anemia of chronic disease (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Weiss, Ganz, &#x0026; Goodnough, 2019</a>). This classification also includes anemia of critical illness that can develop within days after the onset of serious illness, and the anemia associated with aging. Many chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;normochromic:&lt;/b&gt; normal RBC color, indicating normal amount of hemoglobin">normochromic</button></strong>, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;normocytic:&lt;/b&gt; normal size of RBC">normocytic</button></strong> anemia (i.e., RBCs are of normal color and size). These disorders include rheumatoid arthritis, chronic infections, and many cancers. It is important that the underlying condition be identified so that it can be treated appropriately.</p>
<p class="indent">The anemia of inflammation is usually mild to moderate and not progressive. The hemoglobin level does not usually fall below 9 g/dL and bone marrow samples have normal cellularity and normal stores of iron. Erythropoietin levels are low and iron use is blocked by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;erythroid cells:&lt;/b&gt; any cell that is or will become a mature RBC">erythroid cells</button></strong> (cells that are or will become mature RBCs). Erythrocyte survival may also be shortened.</p>
<p class="indent">Many patients with anemia of inflammation have few symptoms related to their anemia and do not require treatment. Treatment of the underlying disorder allows iron stored in the bone marrow to be utilized, promoting increased RBC production and facilitating the rise of hemoglobin levels. Iron supplementation is not beneficial for these patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Evidence suggests that inflammation may have a significant role in the development of anemia in older adults (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Price, 2019</a>). Higher-than-normal levels of inflammatory <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cytokines:&lt;/b&gt; messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or may be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; (&lt;em&gt;synonyms&lt;/em&gt;: biochemical mediators, inflammatory mediators)">cytokines</button></strong> are found in older adults, and this pro-inflammatory state may predispose older adults to frailty. Frailty is manifested by weight loss, impaired mobility, generalized weakness, and loss of balance and is strongly associated with anemia of inflammation. Erythropoietin levels may not rise as expected in response to decreased hemoglobin (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Price, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1105">Aplastic Anemia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aplastic anemia is a rare disease caused by a decrease in or damage to bone marrow stem cells, damage to the microenvironment within the bone marrow, and replacement of marrow with fat. Stem cell damage is caused by the body&#x2019;s T cells, which mediate an attack on the bone marrow resulting in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;aplasia:&lt;/b&gt; lack of cellular development (e.g., of cells within the bone marrow)">aplasia</button></strong> (i.e., markedly reduced hematopoiesis). Therefore, in addition to severe anemia, significant <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;neutropenia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormally low absolute neutrophil count">neutropenia</button></strong> (i.e., lower-than-normal neutrophil count) and <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;thrombocytopenia:&lt;/b&gt; decrease in the number of circulating platelets; associated with the potential for bleeding">thrombocytopenia</button></strong> (i.e., lower-than-normal platelet count) also occur.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1106">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening condition associated with bone marrow failure evidenced by <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pancytopenia:&lt;/b&gt; abnormal decrease in WBCs, RBCs, and platelets">pancytopenia</button></strong> (i.e., anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; lower-than-normal counts of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and platelets) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Peslak, Olson, &#x0026; Babushok, 2017</a>). It can be acquired, or in rare cases, congenital, but most cases are idiopathic (i.e., without apparent cause) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Young, 2018</a>). It may also be associated with certain medications, chemicals, or radiation damage. Agents that have been associated with bone marrow aplasia include benzene and benzene derivatives (i.e., airplane glues, paint remover, dry cleaning solutions). Certain toxic materials, including inorganic arsenic, glycol ethers, plutonium, and radon, have also been suggested as possible causes (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Young, 2018</a>). Nonviral hepatitis may be a precipitating factor in about 10% of cases (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2168">Peslak et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1107">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The onset of symptoms of aplastic anemia is often insidious. Complications stemming from bone marrow failure may occur before the diagnosis is made. Typical complications include infection and symptoms of anemia, including fatigue, pallor, and dyspnea. Purpura (bruising) associated with thrombocytopenia may develop. Any combination of these signs and symptoms should prompt a CBC and hematologic evaluation. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly may also occur. Retinal hemorrhages are common.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1108">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aplastic anemia occurs in some situations when a medication or chemical is ingested in toxic amounts; however, it may occur even when medications are taken at the recommended dosage. This is known as an idiosyncratic reaction in those who are highly susceptible, possibly due to a genetic defect in the biotransformation of the medication or elimination process. The CBC reveals pancytopenia. Patients may have neutrophil counts less than 1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobins less than 10 g/dL, and platelet counts less than 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Segel &#x0026; Lichtman, 2016</a>). A bone marrow biopsy typically reveals an extremely hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow (i.e., with few or no cells), often replaced with fat.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1109">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is believed that aplastic anemia is an immune-mediated condition in which T lymphocytes attack hematopoietic stem cells with subsequent reduction in production of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Aplastic anemia can be successfully treated in many cases. Patients under 60 years of age who are otherwise healthy can often be cured with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from a compatible donor (see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>) (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Young, 2018</a>). In other <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page917" title="917"></span>situations, treatment with immunosuppressive therapy using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and androgens or cyclosporine is useful in managing the disease (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Young, 2018</a>). ATG is a purified gamma-globulin solution that is obtained from rabbits or horses immunized with human T lymphocytes. Side effects of such therapy include fever and chills. There is risk for anaphylaxis with associated bronchospasm and hypotension requiring emergency treatment. Serum sickness, associated with rash, fever, arthralgias, and pruritus may occur in some patients but can be prevented or reduced in some cases with premedication with corticosteroids (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Segel &#x0026; Lichtman, 2016</a>). Serum sickness resolves slowly, often over a few weeks when it occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">Immunosuppressive therapies prevent T cells from destroying stem cells. If relapse does occur, resuming the same immunosuppressive therapy may induce another remission but the response rate is usually reduced (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Segel &#x0026; Lichtman, 2016</a>). Corticosteroids may be beneficial in the short-term; however, in aplastic anemia, long-term use is associated with bony abnormalities including aseptic necrosis and osteopenia.</p>
<p class="indent">Supportive therapies play a critical role in the management of aplastic anemia. All potentially offending medications should be discontinued. Transfusions with PRBCs and platelets are frequently required (see <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a> for discussion of transfusions); however, judicious use of blood products is necessary, especially for patients who are candidates for bone marrow transplant because of the risk for alloimmunization (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2168">Peslak et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). Aggressive treatment of infections is necessary. Deaths associated with aplastic anemia are most often caused by bacterial or fungal infection and bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Prophylaxis against invasive fungal infection is needed for patients who are severely neutropenic. Patients who become lymphopenic after ATG require prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1110">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with aplastic anemia are at high risk for problems associated with deficiencies of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Thorough assessment for signs of infection and bleeding are critical (see later sections on Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia for specific interventions). Nursing care includes monitoring for side effects of therapy, including hypersensitivity reactions while administering ATG. Patients who require long-term cyclosporine therapy should be monitored for long-term effects, including renal and liver dysfunction, hypertension, pruritus, visual changes, tremor, and skin cancer. Education regarding drug&#x2013;drug interactions between ATG and many other drugs is necessary. Patients should be informed that stopping immunosuppressive therapy abruptly is not recommended.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1111">Megaloblastic Anemias</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anemias associated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid deficiency cause the same bone marrow and peripheral blood changes because both are needed for normal DNA synthesis. The erythrocytes produced with these nutritional deficiencies are abnormally large, thus they are termed megaloblastic red blood cells. Other cells from the myeloid stem cell lines (nonlymphoid leukocytes and platelets) are also abnormal. Bone marrow analysis shows hyperplasia (an abnormal increase in the number of cells) and the precursor erythroid and myeloid cells are abnormally large and irregular in appearance. Many of these abnormal cells are destroyed within the bone marrow leading to an insufficient number of mature cells entering the peripheral blood. Over time, pancytopenia may develop. Cells that enter the circulation are often irregularly shaped; neutrophils are hypersegmented, and platelets may be abnormally large. Erythrocytes are abnormally shaped and shapes can vary greatly; this is known as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;poikilocytosis:&lt;/b&gt; variation in shape of RBCs">poikilocytosis</button></strong>. Because erythrocytes are very large, the MCV is very high, often exceeding 110 fL. Megaloblastic anemias usually develop over months, allowing the body to compensate; thus, symptoms do not often occur until the anemia is severe (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Green, 2016</a>). In patients with light skin, the skin may develop a pale-yellow color resulting from simultaneous pallor and mild jaundice from red blood cell hemolysis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1112">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pathophysiologic mechanisms that undergird megaloblastic anemias are most commonly because of either a folic acid or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, as noted previously.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Folic Acid Deficiency</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Folic acid is stored in the body as compounds known as folates. Folate stores are smaller than those of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and can be depleted within months if dietary intake of folate is deficient (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Green, 2016</a>). Folate is found in green vegetables and liver. Folate deficiency is rarely seen in patients who consume uncooked vegetables. Alcohol ingestion increases folic acid requirements and it is not uncommon for those with alcohol abuse disorder to have a diet deficient in folate and other nutrients. Folic acid requirements are also higher in those with liver disease, chronic hemolytic anemias, and in women who are pregnant because erythrocyte production is increased with these conditions. Small bowel diseases such as celiac disease may interfere with normal absorption of folic acid (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Green, 2016</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Deficiency</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can occur in several ways. Inadequate dietary intake is unusual but sometimes can occur in people who follow a vegan diet and do not consume any meat or dairy products. Impaired absorption from the GI tract is more common, especially in older adults. Nearly 20% of older adults have low vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels; 5% to 10% have symptoms related to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Langan &#x0026; Goodbred, 2017</a>). Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency can occur in patients with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, or in patients who have had GI surgery such as ileal resection, bariatric surgery, or gastrectomy. Use of metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as chronic use of histamine blockers, antacids, and proton pump inhibitors to reduce gastric acid can also inhibit vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2150">Lanier et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Absence of intrinsic factor also impairs vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption. When associated with lack of intrinsic factor, the anemia is referred to as pernicious anemia. Intrinsic factor is normally secreted by cells in the gastric mucosa; it binds to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and transports it to the ileum where it is absorbed. Without intrinsic factor, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> taken orally cannot be absorbed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page918" title="918"></span>and deficiency with associated anemia eventually results. Diseases of the pancreas and ileum may impair absorption even when adequate intrinsic factor and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are present. Pernicious anemia tends to run in families. It is typically a disease of adults, especially older adults. The body typically has large stores of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> so years may pass before deficiency results in anemia. The body is able to compensate over time and the anemia is often severe before the patient becomes symptomatic. Because patients with pernicious anemia and low vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels have an increased incidence of gastric cancer they may benefit from screening for gastric cancer with endoscopy at regular intervals (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2157">Miranti, Stolzenberg-Solomon, Weinstein, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1113">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiencies are similar, and the two anemias may coexist. However, the neurologic manifestations of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency do not occur with folic acid deficiency, and they persist if vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is not replaced. Therefore, careful distinction between the two anemias must be made.</p>
<p class="indent">After the body&#x2019;s stores of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are depleted, the patient may begin to show signs and symptoms of the anemia. However, because the onset and progression of the anemia are so gradual, the body can compensate well until the anemia is severe, so the typical manifestations of anemia (weakness, listlessness, fatigue) may not be apparent initially. The hematologic effects of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are accompanied by effects on other organ systems, particularly the GI tract and nervous system. Patients with pernicious anemia develop a smooth, sore, red tongue and mild diarrhea. They are extremely pale, particularly in the mucous membranes. They may become confused; more often, they have paresthesias in the extremities (particularly numbness and tingling in the feet and lower legs). They may have difficulty maintaining their balance because of damage to the spinal cord, and they also lose position sense (proprioception). These symptoms are progressive, although the course of illness may be marked by spontaneous partial remissions and exacerbations. Without treatment, heart failure associated with severe anemia may result, often leading to death several years after onset of symptoms (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Leung, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1114">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Serum levels of both folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are analyzed. Small amounts of folate can increase the serum folate level; therefore, measurement of the amount of folate within the red blood cells is a more sensitive test to determine true folate deficiency although it is not commonly performed.</p>
<p class="indent">The traditional method of determining the cause of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency was the Schilling test, but in recent years this has been replaced by other testing methods. A vitamin B<sub>12</sub> assay is usually the initial test performed but the reliability of the results is sometimes questionable, when vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels are not unequivocally low. Elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels are more sensitive for the diagnosis of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2150">Lanier et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). An intrinsic factor antibody test is often more useful in determining the presence of pernicious anemia. A positive test indicates that antibodies are present that interfere with the binding of the intrinsic factor&#x2013;vitamin B<sub>12</sub> complex to receptors in the ileum, preventing absorption. While not specific for only pernicious anemia, it is useful in helping arrive at the diagnosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1115">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Folate deficiency is easily treated in most cases by increasing the amount of folic acid in the diet and taking 1 mg of folic acid daily as a supplement. Folic acid can be given intramuscularly to those people with conditions associated with malabsorption. While many multivitamin supplements contain folic acid, the amount may not be enough to replace body stores completely. When folate deficiency is associated with alcohol abuse, supplementation should continue as long as the patient is consuming alcohol.</p>
<p class="indent">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is treated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> replacement. People who follow a vegan diet can prevent or treat deficiency with oral supplements with vitamins or fortified soy milk. When deficiency is caused by impaired absorption or absence of intrinsic factor (i.e., pernicious anemia), replacement is typically given by monthly intramuscular injections. It is possible to treat patients with oral preparations in the absence of intrinsic factor but much larger doses are required. Intranasal sprays and gels are also available options to avoid the need for intramuscular injections.</p>
<p class="indent">As vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is replaced, the reticulocyte count rises, often within 1 week, and within 4 to 8 weeks blood counts return to normal (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Green, 2016</a>). The tongue begins to feel better and appears less red after several days. Recovery from neurologic symptoms takes more time, and, if the neuropathy is severe, the patient may not fully recover. To prevent a recurrence of pernicious anemia, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation must continue for life.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1116">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of patients who have or are at risk for megaloblastic anemia includes inspection of the skin, tongue, and mucous membranes. Mild jaundice may be evident and is best seen in the sclera with natural lighting. Vitiligo and premature graying of the hair are frequently present in those with pernicious anemia. Careful neurologic assessment is important to identify neurologic complications. Assessment should include tests of position, vibration sense, and cognitive function. The nurse should pay close attention to the patient&#x2019;s gait and stability with ambulation. Safety is a concern when gait, coordination and position sense are affected. Physical and occupational therapy referrals may be needed to assist in obtaining assistive devices and making sure patients are instructed in their use. When sensation is impaired, patients should be instructed to avoid excessive heat and cold.</p>
<p class="indent">Mouth and tongue soreness may impair nutritional intake. The nurse may instruct the patient to choose soft bland foods that are less likely to cause further discomfort.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Education for patients with pernicious anemia must include the chronic nature of this condition and the necessity of monthly vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections or daily oral vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplements even when symptoms have resolved. Patients <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page919" title="919"></span>or a family caregiver can be taught to administer injections. The risk for gastric cancer is increased in patients with gastric atrophy associated with pernicious anemia making it important that patients understand the need for ongoing follow-up care and screening (see <a href="c40.xhtml">Chapter 40</a> for further discussion on gastric cancer).</p>
