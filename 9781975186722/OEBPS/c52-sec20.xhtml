<h4 class="h4" id="s2480">Special Issues in Breast Cancer Management</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2481">Implications of Genetic Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The rapid advancement in genetics not only has brought new knowledge about inherited breast cancer, but it has also raised potential ethical and psychosocial issues. Although the actual testing for the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> and several other genes that increase risk involves a simple blood or saliva test, ethical and psychosocial issues must first be addressed. Before undergoing genetic testing, a person should meet either with a clinician who has expertise in this area or with a certified genetic counselor to discuss risk factors as well as the benefits, sequelae, and limitations of testing.</p>
<p class="indent">How people react when they receive their actual test results is not always easy to predict. A negative test in a person who comes from a family with a known mutation may lead to enormous relief. However, a negative test in a family with no known mutation may be a source of undue reassurance; the possibility of existing genes that cannot yet be detected remains. A negative test may also lead to feelings of guilt in a person whose family members did not receive favorable test results; this is known as survivor&#x2019;s guilt. A positive test could act as a motivator in a person to pursue appropriate screening or treatment, or it could cause tremendous anxiety, depression, and worry.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, test results may be ambiguous, leading to feelings of confusion and uncertainty. People must be informed that not all gene carriers develop breast cancer (incomplete penetrance) and that not all noncarriers are protected or immune.</p>
<p class="indent">People must be well informed of all issues and potential implications prior to undergoing genetic testing (see Chapter&#x00A0;6). Nurses play a role in educating and counseling patients and their family members about the implications of genetic testing. Nurses provide support and clarification and make referrals to appropriate specialists when indicated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2482">Pregnancy and Breast Cancer</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Breast cancer during pregnancy is defined as breast cancer diagnosed during gestation or within 1 year of childbirth. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1738" title="1738"></span>According to the NCCN, in a California registry study, 1.3 breast cancers are diagnosed in 10,000 live births (NCCN, 2019). Because of increased levels of hormones produced during pregnancy and subsequent lactation, the breast tissue becomes tender and swollen, making it more difficult to detect a mass. If a mass is found during pregnancy, ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic method because it involves no exposure to radiation. If indicated, mammography with appropriate shielding, FNA, and biopsy can be performed. Modified radical mastectomy remains the most common form of surgical treatment. SLNB is typically not offered under 30-week gestation because of the unknown effects of the radioisotope and the blue dye on the fetus (NCCN, 2019). Breast conservation treatment may be considered if the breast cancer is diagnosed during the third trimester. Radiation can then be delayed until after delivery because it is contraindicated during pregnancy. If a woman is close to term, a cesarean section may be performed as soon as maturation of the fetus allows and then treatment is initiated. If aggressive disease is detected early in pregnancy and chemotherapy is advised, termination of the pregnancy may be considered. If a mass is found while a woman is breast-feeding, she is urged to stop to allow the breast to involute (return to its baseline state) before any type of surgery is performed. Endocrine therapy is also contraindicated during pregnancy and should be postponed until the postpartum period.</p>
<p class="indent">Fertility issues and the future desire for children are major concerns of young women who are survivors of breast cancer. Most cancer therapies have a substantial morbidity on reproductive function, not only because they increase the risk of early menopause but also because they are associated with a decreased ovarian reserve and a loss of fertility. It is estimated that physiologic age of the ovaries in a survivor of cancer may be 10 years older than the actual chronologic age.</p>
<p class="indent">Chemotherapy causes a progressive dose-related depletion of ovarian follicles and granulosa cells that translates into oligomenorrhea and subsequent premature ovarian failure, ultimately leading to what is known as chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA). Regardless of the beneficial effects that hormonal changes can have as part of the adjuvant endocrine strategy, CIA is an adverse event to consider when selecting the best adjuvant treatment. Patients with cancer need to be informed about their reproductive future and options to preserve fertility before treatment (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3770">Petersen, Moravek, Woodruff, et al., 2018</a>). SaveMyFertility, a national nonprofit organization, can also provide updated information on reproduction (see the Resources section).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2483">Quality of Life and Survivorship</h5>
<p class="nonindent">With increased early detection and improved treatment modalities, women with breast cancer have become the largest group of cancer survivors. Ninety-nine percent of women diagnosed with early-stage cancer localized to the breast will survive beyond 5 years (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Mehra, Berkowitz, &#x0026; Sanft, 2018</a>). However, the treatment or simply the diagnosis of breast cancer may have long-term effects that negatively affect the patient and her family. The patient should be prepared early on for the potential long-term effects of the disease so that she has realistic expectations and can make informed decisions.</p>
<p class="indent">Survivors of breast cancer may experience a variety of issues as a result of their diagnosis and treatment. Estrogen withdrawal from chemotherapy-induced menopause and hormonal treatments can lead to a variety of symptoms, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary tract infections, weight gain, decreased sex drive, and increased risk of osteoporosis. HT to alleviate symptoms is contraindicated in women with breast cancer. Certain chemotherapeutic agents can cause long-term cardiac effects and neuropathy. In addition, patients may experience impaired cognitive functioning, such as difficulty concentrating (often referred to as &#x201C;chemo brain&#x201D;). Studies have shown some correlation between levels of post-chemotherapy cognitive dysfunction and chemotherapy dosing; higher doses increase dysfunction (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Shahpar, Mhatre, &#x0026; Oza, 2018</a>). Rare long-term effects of radiation can include pneumonitis, rib fractures, heart disease, and breast fibrosis or necrosis (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Pederson &#x0026; Klemp, 2018</a>). Long-term sequelae after breast surgery may include lymphedema (mainly after ALND), pain, and sensory disturbances. Once lymphedema develops, it tends to be a chronic problem, so prevention strategies (discussed earlier) are vital. Weight gain and infections are risk factors for lymphedema (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Makhoul, Banderudrappagari, &#x0026; Pennisi, 2018</a>). Nurses need to encourage patients to maintain an active lifestyle and avoid weight gain.</p>
<p class="indent">Long-term psychosocial sequelae may include fears of recurrence; mood changes (e.g., worry, sadness, anger, frustration); an increased sense of vulnerability, uncertainty, feelings of loss (e.g., fertility); concerns about body image, self-concept, and sexuality; emotional distress related to role adjustments and family response; and concerns about finances and employment. Depression and anxiety have been documented in 20% to 30% of women with breast cancer. Interventions should be targeted to meet informational needs, manage uncertainty, control symptoms, address cultural differences, and enhance social and emotional support (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3819">Makhoul et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2484"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.jpg" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Breast cancer reconstruction in older women with breast cancer is a feasible option that should be offered to patients. Most women tolerate the procedure well and have good cosmetic outcomes. Patients can be offered both implant-based reconstruction and autologous tissue transfer with minimal complications as long as appropriate preoperative selection criteria are used. The safety of reconstruction, together with increase in perceived quality of life, life expectancy, and healthier lifestyles, makes breast reconstruction after mastectomy desirable at any age (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3807">van Ee, Smits, Honkoop, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A thorough assessment must be performed before any treatment is initiated, and careful monitoring must occur throughout the course of treatment to avoid complications. The physical and psychosocial assessment of the older woman should include general health, currently existing comorbidities, performance status, cognitive status, current medications, available resources, and support systems.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2485">Breast Health of Women with Disability</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Disparities in obtaining a mammogram at recommended screening intervals persist for many women, including those <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1739" title="1739"></span>with disability. Prevalence of self-reported use of mammography is lower for women with a disability. Thirty-six million women in the United States are disabled (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019a). Efforts to reduce disparities in breast cancer screening might be more effective if all segments of the population are targeted. Possible barriers to the use of mammography in women with disability include physical inaccessibility of office space and medical equipment; limited transportation and parking options; and time and assistance constraints associated with undressing, transferring, and positioning for medical examinations. People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and those questioning their gender may also be uncomfortable with the health care system and avoid screening (<a href="c52-sec26.xhtml#bib3790">Kates, Ranji, Beamesderfer, et al., 2018</a>). To promote health and wellness, health agencies, providers, and health care plans must promote cancer prevention and educational programs that are inclusive and responsive to the special needs of women with disability (CDC, 2019b).</p>
<p class="indent">An essential role of the nurse is to assist all women, including those with disability, to identify accessible health screening and to advocate for greater accessibility of imaging centers and other health care facilities. Reminding women of the need for recommended clinical breast examinations and mammograms is an important part of nursing care.</p>
