<h4 class="h4" id="s49">The Role of the Nurse Conducting a Health Assessment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The role of the nurse in today&#x2019;s health care system is rooted in a health care model that emphasizes wellness, health promotion, and disease prevention. The professional nurse uses foundational knowledge of scientific evidence and best clinical judgment when assessing patients (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelley, 2018</a>). Various formats for obtaining the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;health history:&lt;/b&gt; the collection of subjective data, most often a series of questions that provides an overview of the patient&#x2019;s current health status">health history</button></strong> (the collection of subjective data about the patient&#x2019;s health status) and performing the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;physical examination:&lt;/b&gt; collection of objective data about the patient&#x2019;s health status">physical examination</button></strong> (the collection of objective data about the patient&#x2019;s health status) have been developed. Regardless of the format, the information obtained by the nurse complements the data obtained by other members of the health care team and focuses on nursing&#x2019;s unique concerns for the patient. The nurse completes a health assessment by obtaining the patient&#x2019;s health history and performing a physical assessment, which can be carried out in a variety of settings. These settings may include an acute care facility, a clinic or outpatient office, a long-term care facility, a school, or the patient&#x2019;s home. The nursing process is a systematic process used by the nurse for assessing, planning, implementing, and evaluating care for the patient (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>). Data are collected and documented in the patient&#x2019;s health record. This record may be on paper or in the <strong>electronic health record (EHR)</strong>, also called the electronic medical record (EMR), enabling clear communication among care team members and the collection of data for continuous improvement in patient care (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib207">Ackley, Ladwig, Flynn Makic, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s50">Effective Communication</h5>
<p class="nonindent">People who seek health care for a specific problem are often anxious. Their anxiety may be increased by fear about potential diagnoses, possible disruption of lifestyle, and other concerns. With this in mind, the nurse attempts to establish rapport, put the patient at ease, encourage honest communication, make eye contact, and listen carefully to the patient&#x2019;s responses to questions about health issues (<a href="#ff4-1">Fig.&#x00A0;4-1</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">When obtaining a health history or performing a physical examination, nurses must be aware of their own nonverbal communication, as well as that of the patient. The nurse should take into consideration the patient&#x2019;s educational background, language proficiency, and cultural background (see following discussion on Cultural Concepts and Cultural Competence). Questions and instructions to the patient should be phrased so that they are easily understandable. Technical terms and medical jargon should be avoided. In addition, the nurse must consider any disability or impairments (hearing, vision, cognitive, and physical limitations). At the end of the assessment, the nurse summarizes and clarifies the information obtained and asks the patient whether they have any questions; this gives the nurse the opportunity to correct misinformation and add facts that may have been omitted.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s51">Cultural Concepts</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The concept of culture and its relationship to the health care beliefs and practices of patients and their family or significant others provide the foundation for transcultural nursing. This awareness of culture in the delivery of nursing care has been described in different terms and phrases, including respect for cultural diversity or cultural humility; cultural awareness or sensitivity; comprehensive care; cultural consciousness or culturally congruent nursing care (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Alexander-Ruff &#x0026; Kinion, 2019</a>; <a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib236">Henderson, Horne, Hills, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;culture:&lt;/b&gt; the knowledge, belief, art, morals, laws, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by humans as members of society">Culture</button></strong> is commonly defined as the knowledge, belief, art, morals, laws, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by humans as members of society. Such groups may distinguish themselves by socioeconomic class, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, physical disability, or some other specific characteristic (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib233">Fioravanti, Puskar, Knapp, et al., 2018</a>). During the past century, many other definitions of culture have been offered that integrate these themes as well as the themes of ethnic variations of a population. Culture also implies that something is learned or developed, a process that occurs over time. Leininger (2002), founder of the specialty known as transcultural nursing, noted that culture involves learned and transmitted knowledge about values, beliefs, rules of behavior, and lifestyle practices that guide designated groups in their thinking and actions in patterned ways. Culture guides each person&#x2019;s thinking, doing, and being, and becomes patterned expressions of who that person is and becomes.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;ethnicity:&lt;/b&gt; affiliation relating to large groups of people classed according to common racial, national, tribal, religious, linguistic, or cultural background">Ethnicity</button></strong> is defined as an affiliation relating to large groups of people classed according to common racial, national, tribal, religious, linguistic, or cultural background.</p>
<p class="indent">Ethnic culture has four basic characteristics:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Learned from birth through language and socialization</span></li>
<li><span>Shared by members of the same cultural group, and it includes an internal sense and external perception of distinctiveness</span></li>
<li><span>Influenced by specific conditions related to environmental and technical factors and to the availability of resources</span></li>
<li><span>Dynamic and ever changing</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">With the exception of the first characteristic, culture related to age, physical appearance, and lifestyle, as well as other less frequently acknowledged aspects, also shares these characteristics.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s52">Cultural Competence</h5>
<p class="nonindent">By the middle of the 21st century, the non&#x2013;Hispanic Caucasian population is projected to proportionally decrease so that it will no longer comprise the <em>majority</em> population, and other ethnic and racial populations (i.e., <em>minority</em> populations as compared to non&#x2013;Hispanic Caucasians) will collectively comprise the majority of all Americans. This projected phenomenon is called the <em>majority&#x2013;minority</em> crossover (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Colby &#x0026; Ortman, 2015</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">According to the 2017 National Nursing Workforce Survey, more than 80% of all nurses are Caucasian (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib248">Smiley, Lauer, Bienemy, et al., 2018</a>). Progress toward increasing the percentage of culturally diverse nurses has been significantly slower than the increasing percentage of ethnic minorities in the United States. Educational institutions must prepare nurses to deliver culturally competent care and must work to increase the number of ethnic minority providers in the nursing workforce. <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;culturally competent care:&lt;/b&gt; effective, individualized care that demonstrates respect for the dignity, personal rights, preferences, beliefs, and practices of the person receiving care while acknowledging the biases of the caregiver and preventing these biases from interfering with the care provided">Culturally competent care</button></strong> is defined as effective, individualized care that demonstrates respect for the dignity, personal rights, preferences, beliefs, and practices of the person receiving care while acknowledging the biases of the caregiver and preventing these biases from interfering with the care provided. Nurse educators are exploring creative ways to promote cultural competence and humanistic care in nursing students, including offering multicultural health studies in their curricula. Simulation methods and role-playing could be effective methods to practice person-centered culturally competent care (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib233">Fioravanti et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cultural diversity remains an important issue in health care today. Nurses are expected to provide culturally competent care for patients. To do so, nurses must work effectively with the increasing number of patients, nurses, and health care team members whose ancestry reflects the multicultural complexion of contemporary society.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s53">Ethical Use of Health Assessment Data</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Whenever information is elicited from a person through a health history or physical examination, the person has the right to know why the information is sought and how it will be used. Information is only shared with appropriate heath care team members (<a href="c04-sec05.xhtml#bib280">Weber &#x0026; Kelly, 2018</a>). It is also important that the person knows that the decision to participate is voluntary. A private setting for the history interview and physical examination should promote trust and encourage open, honest communication. After the history and examination are completed, the nurse selectively records the data pertinent to the patient&#x2019;s health status. This record of the patient&#x2019;s history and physical examination findings is then securely maintained and made available only to those health professionals directly involved in the care of the patient. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), passed in 1996, established national standards to protect individuals&#x2019; medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically. The act requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal health information and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such information without patient authorization. HIPAA outlines patients&#x2019; rights over their health information, including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records and to request corrections (U.S. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services [HHS], 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s54">The Role of Technology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The use of technology to augment the information-gathering process, particularly through the use of EHRs, has become an increasingly important aspect of obtaining a health history and physical examination. An EHR offers convenient access to health data for the patient and for providers who can use the information more effectively to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care. The information in EHRs also can be shared with other organizations involved in care of the patients if the systems interface (HHS, 2019b). Nurses must be sensitive to the needs of older adults and others who may not be comfortable with newer technology. Nurses may need to allow extra time, provide detailed instructions, explanations, or assistance. It is important to establish and maintain eye contact with the patient during the health history and to not focus solely on the computer screen for data entry.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s55">Assessment in the Home or Community</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of patients in community settings, including the home, consists of collecting information specific to existing health problems, including data on the patient&#x2019;s physiologic and emotional status, the community and home environment, the adequacy of support systems or care given by family and other care providers, and the availability of needed resources. In addition, it is important to evaluate the ability of the person and the family to cope with and address their respective needs. The physical assessment in the community and the home consists of similar techniques to those used in the hospital, outpatient clinic, or office setting. Privacy is provided, and the patient is made as comfortable as possible. See <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> for more information on community-based nursing practice.</p>
