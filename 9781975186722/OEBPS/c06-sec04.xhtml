<h4 class="h4" id="s103">Testing and Screening for Adult-Onset Conditions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Adult-onset conditions with a genetic or genomic basis are manifested during adulthood and the disease is clearly observed to run in families. Some conditions typically associated with advanced age that manifest earlier in life may also have a genetic correlation and require further examination. For example, hypercholesterolemia is often considered an adult-onset disorder associated with a diet high in fat. A form of hypercholesterolemia with excessively high cholesterol levels and lack of lifestyle risk factors correlates with a genetic alteration referred to as familial hypercholesterolemia (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Knowles, Rader, &#x0026; Khoury, 2017</a>). This is an autosomal dominant disorder, suggesting that there is a 50% likelihood that each child of a parent with the disorder will inherit this disorder. Cascade screening of children of parents with familial hypercholesterolemia would be indicated to identify whether or not they have the disorder so that they may be promptly identified and treated (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib416">Setia, Saxena, Sawhney, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Adult-onset genetic conditions can be attributed to specific genetic mutations and follow either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern; however, most adult-onset conditions are considered to be genomic or multifactorial&#x2014;that is, they result from a combination of genes or gene&#x2013;environment interactions. Examples of multifactorial conditions include heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Genomic or multifactorial influences involve interactions among several genes (gene&#x2013;gene interactions) and between genes and the environment (gene&#x2013;environment interactions), the person&#x2019;s lifestyle. Furthermore, some adult-onset conditions occur due to sporadic changes to a gene (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Gael &#x0026; Veltman, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing assessment for adult-onset conditions is based on family history, personal and medical risk factors, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page128" title="128"></span>identification of associated diseases or clinical manifestations (the phenotype). Knowledge of adult-onset conditions and their genetic bases (i.e., mendelian vs. multifactorial conditions) influences the nursing considerations for genetic testing and health promotion. <a href="#tt6-5">Table&#x00A0;6-5</a> describes select adult-onset conditions, their age of onset, patterns of inheritance, molecular genetics, and test availability.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s104">Single Gene Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">If a single gene accounts for an adult-onset condition in a symptomatic person, testing is used to confirm a diagnosis to assist in the plan of care and management. Diagnostic testing for adult-onset conditions is most frequently used with autosomal dominant conditions, such as Huntington disease or Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, and with autosomal recessive conditions such as hemochromatosis. Other single gene conditions are associated with a confirmed genetic mutation in an affected family member or with a family history suggestive of an inherited pattern of adult-onset disease, such as a particular type of cancer. <strong>Presymptomatic testing</strong> provides information to people without symptoms about the presence of a genetic mutation and about the likelihood of developing the disease. Presymptomatic testing is considered for people in families with a known adult-onset condition in which either a positive or a negative test result indicates an increased or reduced risk of developing the disease, affects medical management, or allows earlier treatment of a condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Huntington disease has long served as the model for presymptomatic testing because the presence of the genetic mutation predicts disease onset and progression. Although preventive measures are not yet available for Huntington disease, the genetic information enables health care providers to develop a clinical, supportive, and psychological plan of care. Indeed, the presence of a single gene mutation has implications for the risk of developing many types of cancer; therefore, presymptomatic testing has become more common as a means to start early planning and implementation of select medical measures that may reduce that risk (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Edwards &#x0026; Maradiegue, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s105">Genomic Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The foremost factor that may influence the development and severity of disease is a person&#x2019;s genomic makeup. In the absence of a single disease-causing gene, it is thought that multiple genes and other environmental factors are related to the onset of most adult diseases. For some diseases, the interactions among several genes and other environmental or metabolic events affect disease onset and progression. Specific gene&#x2013;gene interactions or SNPs can confer susceptibility to disease. Genomic testing helps distinguish variations within the same disease or response to treatment. For example, no single gene is associated with osteoporosis. Several polymorphisms on candidate genes related to the vitamin D receptor, estrogen and androgen receptors, and regulation of bone mineral density (BMD) have been shown to contribute to osteoporosis and fracture risk. Moreover, diet and exercise have a strong interaction with the polymorphisms regulating BMD (<a href="c06-sec08.xhtml#bib435">Cho, Lee, &#x0026; Kang, 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">Some genomic tests may predict treatment response. For example, people may present with similar clinical signs and symptoms of asthma but have different responses to corticosteroid treatment. Mutations in genes that regulate corticosteroid receptors can help classify people with asthma as sensitive or resistant to treatment with corticosteroids (NCBI, NLM, 2019b).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s106">The Nursing Role in Testing and Screening for Adult-Onset Conditions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nurses participate in explaining risk and genetic predisposition, supporting informed health decisions and opportunities for prevention and early intervention, clarifying legal protections and risks related to genetic testing or health concerns, and protecting patients&#x2019; privacy. Nurses assess family histories, which may indicate that multiple generations (autosomal dominant inheritance) or multiple siblings (autosomal recessive inheritance) are affected with the same condition or that onset of disease is earlier than expected (e.g., multiple generations with early-onset hyperlipidemia). Possible adult-onset conditions are discussed with other members of the health care team for appropriate resources and referral. When a family history of disease is identified, a patient is made aware that this is a risk factor for disease; resources and referral are then provided. It is the patient&#x2019;s decision whether or not to pursue a genetic testing workup. For example, if a 45-year-old woman presents for her annual gynecology visit and reports a family history of colon cancer in multiple paternal relatives, including her father, the nurse should discuss the family history with the gynecologist. In addition, the woman should be alerted to the risk of colon cancer on the basis of the family history and given information about possible genetic testing and referral for a colonoscopy.</p>
<p class="indent">If the existence of a mutation for an adult-onset condition in a family is identified, at-risk family members can be referred for cascade screening for a specific genetic disorder based on genetic susceptibility or genetic predisposition. If the patient is found to carry the mutation, the nurse provides them with information and referral for risk-reduction measures and educates the person about the risk to other family members. In that discussion, the nurse assures the patient that the test results are private and confidential and will not be shared with others, including family members, without the patient&#x2019;s permission. If the patient is an unaffected family member, the nurse discusses inheritance and the risk of developing the disease, provides support for the decision making process, and offers referral for genetics services.</p>
