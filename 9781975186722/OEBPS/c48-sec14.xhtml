<h4 class="h4" id="s2187">Kidney Transplantation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for select and appropriately screened patients with ESKD. It is not considered a cure for ESKD since, in general, the transplant will not continue to function for the entire lifespan of most recipients (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Danovitch, 2017</a>). Patients choose kidney transplantation for various reasons, such as the desire to avoid dialysis or to improve their sense of well-being and the wish to lead a more normal life. Kidney transplantation is an elective procedure, not an emergency lifesaving procedure. Therefore, patients should be in the best possible physical condition prior to transplantation.</p>
<p class="indent">In the United States and globally, there are many more patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation than there are organ donors. More than 103,356 Americans are on the waiting list to receive a kidney (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3553">Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [OPTN], 2019</a>). In the United States, the cost of a kidney transplant annually per person is estimated at $34,084 versus about $88,750 annually per person for in center HD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3556">Saran, Robinson, Abbott, et al., 2018</a>). Kidney transplantation involves transplanting a kidney from a living or deceased donor to a recipient who no longer has renal function. A living donor may or may not be related to the recipient. A deceased donor transplant comes from someone who has died and donated their organs. The term &#x201C;cadaveric donor&#x201D; is no longer used and the appropriate terminology is &#x201C;deceased donor.&#x201D; Transplantation from well-matched living donors (those with compatible ABO and human leukocyte antigens) is more successful than from deceased donors, especially long term (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Woodard &#x0026; Arnold, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The NKF provides written information describing the organ donation program and a card specifying the organs to be donated in the event of death. The organ donation card is signed by the donor and two witnesses and should be carried by the donor at all times. In many states in the United States, drivers can indicate their desire to be organ donors on their driver&#x2019;s license application or renewal. However, the donor should discuss this decision with family members because the organ procurement agency will approach the family to explore this option.</p>
<p class="indent">Contemporary developments in kidney transplantation are paired exchanges and chains. In paired donor exchanges and chains, recipients swap compatibly matched kidneys with willing donors, who are unrelated or unknown to the recipient. Although medically eligible to donate a kidney, a willing donor may be incompatible with the intended recipient due to blood type or antigens. The donor then agrees to donate the kidney to a compatible and unknown recipient, with the intention that the donor&#x2019;s originally intended organ recipient will be part of the donation chain and be the recipient of a donated kidney through organized donor and recipient matches. Several national registry programs have organized systems to find a matching pair on the national level (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Woodard &#x0026; Arnold, 2017</a>). See Resources at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to either receiving or donating an organ, an extensive medical evaluation is performed; first on the potential recipient and then, if the recipient is deemed suitable for a transplant, the living donor is evaluated. Not everyone is suitable for kidney transplantation. Contraindications include recent malignancy, active or chronic infection (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B and C), severe irreversible extrarenal disease (e.g., inoperable cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, severe peripheral vascular disease), Class II obesity (body mass index greater than 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), current substance use disorder (SUD), inability to give informed consent, active psychiatric disease, and history of nonadherence to treatment regimens (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Bunnapradist et al., 2017</a>; <a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Woodard &#x0026; Arnold, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Donors may be rejected for the same reasons or any condition that is determined to have an impact on the remaining kidney. Examples include hypertension and diabetes because both are known causes of kidney disease. It is imperative when donors are evaluated that serious consideration be given to the overall long-term health of the donor. Every precaution must be taken to ensure that the remaining kidney in the donor will remain healthy. When these conditions are met, the donor should remain healthy after donation and have a normal lifespan. Because one kidney can easily handle the body&#x2019;s needs, no long-term adjustments will need to be made. Routine health maintenance visits are stressed for blood pressure monitoring and preventative care.</p>
<p class="indent">The recipient&#x2019;s native kidneys are not usually removed, except for enlarged polycystic kidneys with cysts that may rupture or become infected (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Bunnapradist et al., 2017</a>). In some centers, for the patient with polycystic kidneys, the surgeon may perform a bilateral nephrectomy simultaneously with the renal transplant, while in others, the native nephrectomy precedes or is scheduled after the transplant procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">The transplanted kidney is placed in the patient&#x2019;s iliac fossa anterior to the iliac crest because it allows for easier access to the blood supply needed to perfuse the kidney. The ureter of the newly transplanted kidney is transplanted into the bladder or anastomosed to the ureter of the recipient (see <a href="#ff48-9">Fig.&#x00A0;48-9</a>). Once the blood supply has been reestablished to the transplanted kidney in the operating room, urine should begin to flow. For deceased donor kidneys, the production of urine at this stage is an important indicator of the overall success of the procedure and ultimate long-term outcome (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Longton, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2188">Preoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative management goals include bringing the patient&#x2019;s metabolic state to a level as close to normal as possible through diet, possibly dialysis and medical management, ensuring that the patient is free of infection, and educating the patient for surgery and the postoperative course.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2189">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A complete physical examination is performed on the living donor and the recipient to detect and treat any conditions that could cause complications after the living donor nephrectomy and recipient transplantation procedure. Tissue typing, blood typing, and antibody screening are performed to determine compatibility of the tissues and cells of the donor and recipient. Other diagnostic tests must be completed for both potential donor and recipient to identify conditions requiring treatment before the transplant procedure.</p>

<p class="indent">Both patients must be free of infection at the time of kidney transplantation. After surgery, medications to prevent transplant rejection will be prescribed for the transplant recipient. These medications suppress the immune response, leaving the patient at risk for infection. Therefore, both the donor and recipient are evaluated and treated for any infections, including gingival (gum) disease and dental caries.</p>
<p class="indent">A psychosocial evaluation is conducted to assess the organ recipient&#x2019;s ability to adjust to the transplant, coping styles, social history, social support available, and financial resources. Psychiatric conditions are often aggravated by the corticosteroids and other medications needed for immunosuppression after transplantation, so a history of psychiatric illness is important to obtain (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Shenoy &#x0026; Danovitch, 2017</a>). A psychosocial evaluation is also conducted to assess the motive of the donor for giving the organ. The donor should not be coerced to donate this organ; it should be an altruistic act (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3520">Rastogi, Hersh-Rifkin, Gritsch, et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2190">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nursing aspects of preoperative care for the patient undergoing kidney transplant and donation are similar to those for patients undergoing other types of kidney or elective abdominal surgery. Preoperative education can be conducted in a variety of settings, including the outpatient preadmission area, the hospital, or the transplantation clinic during the preliminary work up phase. Patient education for the kidney transplant donor and recipient addresses postoperative pulmonary hygiene, pain management options, dietary restrictions, IV lines, tubes (indwelling catheter), and early ambulation. Most patients have been on dialysis for months or years before transplantation, eagerly awaiting a kidney transplant, and are anxious about the surgery, possible rejection, and the need to return to dialysis. Helping the patient to deal with these concerns is part of the nurse&#x2019;s role in preoperative management, as is educating the patient about what to expect after surgery. HD may be performed before the kidney transplantation procedure. When the patient is receiving peritoneal dialysis, the patient will continue to dialyze until the surgery. The dwell will be drained prior to going to the operating room.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient who receives a kidney from a living related donor is often concerned about the donor and how the donor will tolerate the surgical procedure. If the patient is receiving a deceased donor transplant, the recipient may express sadness and grief over the loss of the donor&#x2019;s life. The nurse must maintain open communication with the recipient of the organ and allow the patient to express these concerns.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse working in an intensive care setting may provide care to the organ donor who is declared brain dead prior to organ removal. In the absence of brain death, deceased donation may also occur after the heart has stopped beating (donation after cardiac death or non&#x2013;heart-beating donor). The overall goal is to preserve the function of the organs through maintaining hemodynamic stability, decreasing the risk for infection, and monitoring laboratory values while providing dignified care to the donor and family members (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Woodard &#x0026; Arnold, 2017</a>). Continuing care for the donor can be complex and last for more than several hours. Care is often provided in collaboration with the organ procurement and transplant coordinators.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2191">Postoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goal of postoperative care is to maintain homeostasis until the transplanted kidney is functioning well. The patient whose kidney functions immediately has a more favorable prognosis than the patient whose kidney does not (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Longton, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Often, the living organ donor will be on the same unit as the transplant recipient. The donor will require the same level of care provided to the recipient, including follow-up at prescribed intervals after the procedure and long-term. The organ donor often experiences more pain than the recipient, requiring more analgesia for pain control. Fluid, electrolyte, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1598" title="1598"></span>and hemodynamic status are also closely monitored in the living organ donor.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2192">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">After a kidney transplantation, rejection and failure can occur within 24 hours (hyperacute), within 3 to 14 days (acute), or after many years (chronic). A hyperacute rejection is caused by an immediate antibody-mediated reaction that leads to generalized glomerular capillary thrombosis and necrosis. An acute rejection typically occurs within a few days to weeks of the transplant surgery, and the patient experiences an increase in serum creatinine values. If the rejection continues, the patient may have fever, tenderness at the transplant site, malaise, and oliguria, but these are generally considered late signs (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Longton, 2017</a>). An acute rejection requires early recognition and treatment with immunosuppressant therapy, whereas a hyperacute reaction would require immediate removal of the transplanted organ (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Longton, 2017</a>). The long-term survival of a transplanted kidney depends on how well it matches the recipient and how well the body&#x2019;s immune response is controlled. The body&#x2019;s immune system views the transplanted kidney as &#x201C;foreign.&#x201D; Therefore, it continually works to reject it. To overcome or minimize the body&#x2019;s defense mechanisms, immunosuppressive agents are given. Optimally, medications modify the immune system enough to prevent rejection, although not enough to allow infections or malignancies to develop (see <a href="#tt48-4">Table&#x00A0;48-4</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Combinations of corticosteroids and medications specifically developed to affect the action of lymphocytes are used to minimize the body&#x2019;s reaction to the transplanted organ. Treatment with combinations of new agents has dramatically improved patient and graft survival rates, and now 90% to 95% of transplanted kidneys still function after 1 year (OPTN, 2019). Doses of immunosuppressive agents are often adjusted depending on the patient&#x2019;s immunologic response to the transplant. However, the patient will be required to take some form of immunosuppressive therapy for the entire time that they have the transplanted kidney. Grapefruit juice and grapefruit interact with many immunosuppressant medications and should be avoided (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Comerford &#x0026; Durkin, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The risks associated with taking these medications include nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hirsutism, tremors, blood dyscrasias, cataracts, gingival hyperplasia, and several types of cancer (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Sievers, Lum, &#x0026; Danovitch, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2193"><img class="m" src="images/icon52.jpg" alt=""/> COVID-19 Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the need for immunosuppression, patients who have undergone kidney transplantation are at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Ajaimy &#x0026; Melamed, 2020</a>). One study reported outcomes of 41 patients who had a transplanted kidney, 22 of whom had confirmed COVID-19 and 19 of whom had suspected COVID-19 (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3541">Husain, Dube, Morris, et al., 2020</a>). Among the 41 patients, 13 needed to be hospitalized while the rest were managed on an outpatient <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1599" title="1599"></span>basis being closely monitored with telehealth. The majority (80%) of patients reported fever but those requiring hospitalization were more likely to report dyspnea compared to those not requiring hospitalization. Patients requiring hospitalization also had higher serum creatinine levels upon admission, suggesting compromise of the function of their transplanted kidneys. More than half of the patients (63%), whether hospitalized or not, had a reduction in the immunosuppressive regimen but there was no reported mortality (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Husain et al., 2020</a>). These findings suggest that it may be safe to lower the immunosuppressive regimen of patients who have undergone kidney transplantation to augment the ability of their immune system to fight COVID-19.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2194">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Assessing the Patient for Transplant Rejection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After kidney transplantation, the nurse assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of transplant rejection: oliguria, edema, fever, increasing blood pressure, weight gain, and swelling or tenderness over the transplanted kidney or graft. Patients receiving cyclosporine may not exhibit the usual signs and symptoms of acute rejection. In these patients, the only sign may be an asymptomatic rise in the serum creatinine level (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Longton, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The results of blood chemistry tests and leukocyte and platelet counts are monitored closely because immunosuppression depresses the formation of leukocytes and platelets. The patient is closely monitored for infection because of susceptibility to impaired healing and infections related to immunosuppressive therapy and complications of kidney disease. Clinical manifestations of infection include shaking chills, fever, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), tachypnea (rapid respirations), as well as either leukocytosis (increase in WBCs) or leukopenia (decrease in WBCs).</p>
<p class="indent">Infection may be introduced through many sources. Urine cultures are performed frequently because of the high incidence of bacteriuria during early and late stages of transplantation. Any type of wound drainage should be viewed as a potential source of infection because drainage is an excellent culture medium for bacteria. Catheter and drain tips may be cultured when removed by cutting off the tip of the catheter or drain (using aseptic technique) and placing the tip in a sterile container to be sent to the laboratory for culture (see <a href="#ct48-14">Chart&#x00A0;48-14</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse ensures that the patient is protected from exposure to infection by hospital staff and in the environment (e.g., fresh flowers are not permitted in the transplant unit), visitors, and other patients with active infections. Attention to hand hygiene by all who come in contact with the patient is imperative.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Urinary Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A kidney from a living donor who is related to the patient usually begins to function immediately after surgery and may produce large quantities of dilute urine. A kidney from a deceased donor may undergo ATN and therefore may not function for 2 or 3 weeks, during which time anuria, oliguria, or polyuria may be present. During this stage, the patient may experience significant changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Therefore, careful monitoring is indicated. The output from the urinary catheter is measured every hour. IV fluids are given on the basis of urine volume and serum electrolyte levels, as prescribed by the primary provider. HD may be necessary postoperatively to maintain homeostasis until the transplanted kidney is functioning well. It also may be required if fluid overload and hyperkalemia occur. The vascular access for HD is assessed to ensure patency and to evaluate for evidence of infection.</p>
<div class="box1a">
<p class="BoxpNumber" id="ct48-14"><strong>Chart&#x00A0;48-14</strong></p></div>
<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong>Kidney Transplant Rejection and Infection</strong></p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="BoxpPARA">Renal graft rejection and failure may occur within 24 hours (hyperacute), within 3 to 14 days (acute), or after many years (chronic). It is not uncommon for a treatable rejection episode to occur during the first year after transplantation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Detecting Rejection</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Ultrasonography may be used to detect hydronephrosis (enlargement of the kidney) due to obstruction of urine flow; percutaneous renal biopsy (most reliable) and nuclear medicine studies are used to evaluate transplant rejection. If the body rejects the transplanted kidney, the patient needs to commence dialysis. The rejected kidney may or may not be removed, depending on when the rejection occurs (acute vs. chronic) and the risk for infection if the kidney is left in place.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Potential Infection</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Infection continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients, both due to the surgical procedure, the high doses of induction immunosuppression given in the postoperative period, and the continuing need for maintenance immunosuppression. The majority of infections happen in the first month after transplantation and are generally due to the complications of the surgery or invasive medical devices (IV, central line, and urinary catheters and ureteral stents) and mostly involve the genitourinary tract (since this is the focus of the surgery). The most common infections include genitourinary infections, pneumonia, wound and abdominal fluid collection infections, device-related infections, and, later in the transplant course, viral diseases. After 6 months, patients who have stable kidney function, have not required treatment for rejection or a need for reoperation are considered as having a successful outcome with stable maintenance immunosuppression and, thus, decreased infectious risks. When recipients have poor renal function, have had rejection treatments which have necessitated increased immunosuppression, and have ongoing issues with genitourinary dysfunction, opportunistic infections are more likely to present, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other human herpesviruses (HHV) and polyoma virus. Despite the continuing menace of infection in renal transplant recipients, the 1-year patient survival rates are close to 100% and graft survival exceeds 90%.</p>
<p class="BoxpCreditsListPara">Adapted from Schaenman, J., &#x0026; Kubak, B. (2017). Infections in kidney transplantation. In G. Danovitch (Ed.), <em>Handbook of kidney transplantation</em> (6th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Addressing Psychological Concerns</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The rejection of a transplanted kidney is of great and ongoing concern to the patient, the family, and the health care team. The fear of kidney rejection and the complications of immunosuppressive therapy (Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome, diabetes, capillary fragility, osteoporosis, glaucoma, cataracts, acne, nephrotoxicity) place tremendous psychological stress on the patient. If the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1600" title="1600"></span>organ donor was a family member there may be added emotional responses that need to be addressed. Anxiety and uncertainty about the future and difficult post transplantation adjustment are often sources of stress for the patient and family.</p>
<p class="indent">An important nursing function is the assessment of the patient&#x2019;s stress and coping. Psychosocial issues are common in individuals and families with chronic diseases, and ESKD is a chronic disease (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Shenoy &#x0026; Danovitch, 2017</a>). The nurse uses each visit with the patient to determine if the patient and family are coping effectively and the patient is adhering to the prescribed medication regimen. If indicated or requested, the nurse refers the patient for counseling (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Longton, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient undergoing kidney transplantation is at risk for the postoperative complications that are associated with any surgical procedure. In addition, the patient&#x2019;s physical condition may be compromised because of the effects of long-standing kidney disease and its treatment. Therefore, careful assessment of the complications related to kidney disease and often, diabetes and hypertension, and those associated with a major surgery are important aspects of nursing care. Breathing exercises, early ambulation, and care of the surgical incision are priorities of postoperative care.</p>
<p class="indent">GI ulceration and corticosteroid-induced bleeding may occur. Therefore, preventative medications such as H<sub>2</sub>-blockers (e.g., famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (e.g., omeprazole) are prescribed. Fungal colonization of the GI tract (especially the mouth) and urinary bladder may occur secondary to immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapy; thus, prophylactic oral antifungal mouth rinses are prescribed. Closely assessing the patient and notifying the primary provider about the occurrence of these complications are important nursing interventions. In addition, the patient is monitored for any signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency if the immunosuppressive regimen has included the use of long-term corticosteroids.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse works closely with the patient and family to be sure that they understand the need for continuing immunosuppressive therapy as prescribed. In addition, the patient and family are educated on how to assess for and report signs and symptoms of transplant rejection, infection, or significant adverse effects of the immunosuppressive regimen. The patient and family are educated about the need to report decreased urine output; weight gain; malaise; fever; respiratory distress; tenderness over the transplanted kidney; anxiety; depression; changes in eating, drinking, or other habits; and changes in blood pressure. The patient is instructed to inform all health care providers (e.g., dentist) about the kidney transplant and the use of immunosuppressive agents.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient needs to know that follow-up care after transplantation is a lifelong necessity. Individual written instructions with verbal explanations are provided concerning diet, medication, fluids, daily weight, daily measurement of urinary output, management of oral intake, prevention of infection and rejection, resumption of activity, and avoidance of contact sports in which the transplanted kidney may be injured. Because of the risk of other potential complications, the patient is followed closely by a health care team that includes the nephrologist, transplant surgeon, transplant coordinator or nurse, social worker, transplant pharmacist, and dietitian. Medications are often obtained at one pharmacy or through the pharmacy at the hospital where the transplant surgery was performed for the purpose of accurate medication reconciliation. Follow-up with providers from the transplant team will initially occur once or twice a week upon discharge from the hospital and taper over time. Laboratory studies will also be obtained and followed on an ongoing basis to monitor the function of the kidney.</p>
<p class="indent">Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality after transplantation, due in part to the increasing age of patients with transplants. An additional problem is possible malignancy; patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy are at higher risk for cancers than the general population (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Huang &#x0026; Kasiske, 2017</a>). The nurse reminds the patient of the importance of health promotion and health screening and provides information on local transplantation support groups at the transplant hospital or through the procurement organization.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) and the NKF (listed in the Resources section of this chapter) are nonprofit organizations that serve the needs of those with kidney disease. These groups can provide many helpful suggestions for patients and family members learning to cope with the journey of dialysis and transplantation.</p>
