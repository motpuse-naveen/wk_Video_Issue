<p class="nonindent">Cancer is a common health problem worldwide. In the United States, it was estimated in 2019 that more than 1,700,000 new cancer cases would be diagnosed, and that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page303" title="303"></span>more than 600,000 Americans would die as a result of cancer (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Siegel, Miller, &#x0026; Jemal, 2019</a>). Despite significant advances in science and technology, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. The leading causes of cancer-related death in the United States in order of frequency and location are lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer in men and lung, breast, and colorectal cancer in women. Most cancer occurs in older adults; according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), 80% of all cancer diagnoses are in people 55 years of age or older (2019a). Overall, the incidence of cancer is slightly higher in women than in men (ACS, 2019a).</p>

<p class="indent">Cancer affects all groups of people; however, some groups are more adversely affected by cancer than others (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2019a). Differences in cancer measures (e.g., incidence, screening rates, stage of diagnosis, morbidity, mortality) or cancer-related health conditions are termed <em>cancer health disparities</em>. These disparities often result from multiple, complex interrelated factors, including indicators of socioeconomic status (e.g., income, educational level, health care access), culture, diet, stress, the environment, and biology.</p>
<p class="indent">Cancer health disparities are most often observed among people of low-socioeconomic status, certain races/ethnicities, and those who reside in particular geographical locations (NCI, 2019a). For example, even though the overall rate of cancer deaths has declined, cancer death rates in non-Hispanic Black men and women remain substantially higher compared to all other racial and ethnic groups for most cancer types (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib968">DeSantis, Miller, Goding Sauer, et al., 2019</a>). Hispanic/Latino Americans have a lower overall cancer incidence when compared to non-Hispanic White Americans; however, the incidence of infection-related cancers (e.g., liver cancer) is two times higher in those of Hispanic/Latino origin compared to non-Hispanic White Americans (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1004">Miller, Goding Sauer, Ortiz, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Cancer incidence and death rates also vary by geography. In states where the prevalence of tobacco use is high (e.g., Kentucky), the incidence of lung cancer tends to be greater than in states where smoking is not as common (e.g., Utah) (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Siegel et al., 2019</a>). In locations where there is greater socioeconomic disparity, the incidence of cancer and overall cancer death rates are higher than in regions where there is not such a disparity (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Siegel et al., 2019</a>). For example, the incidence of cancers of the lung, colon and rectum, and cervix are substantially higher in Appalachian Ohio (southwestern region of the state) than in more affluent and more populated regions of the state (NCI, 2019a).</p>
