<h4 class="h4" id="s1155">Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura</h4>
<p class="nonindent">ITP is a condition that affects people of all ages but is most common in children and young women. This disorder is also referred to as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and immune thrombocytopenia. Primary ITP occurs as an isolated disorder while secondary ITP is associated with other disorders including autoimmune disorders (e.g., antiphospholipid antibody syndrome), viral infections (e.g., hepatitis C, HIV), and some drugs (e.g., cephalosporins, sulfonamides, furosemide). A platelet count less than 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> with no explicable cause is the primary criterion for the diagnosis (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Nomura, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1156">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Primary ITP is an acquired immune disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia that results from pathologic antiplatelet antibodies, impaired production of megakaryocytes, and T-cell&#x2013;mediated destruction of platelets. Secondary ITP is associated with other underlying disorders, including autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis), HIV infection, <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection, or underlying immune dysregulation syndromes, such as common variable immunodeficiency. The majority of adults with ITP (approximately 80%) have primary ITP. With both types of ITP, antiplatelet antibodies develop and bind to the patient&#x2019;s platelets. The antibody-bound platelets are then destroyed by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and tissue macrophages. The body attempts to compensate for the platelet destruction by increasing platelet production within the bone marrow (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Lambert &#x0026; Gernsheimer, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1157">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">ITP is often asymptomatic; the low platelet count frequently is an incidental finding. Platelet counts of less than 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup> are not uncommon. Common signs of thrombocytopenia include easy bruising, heavy menses, and petechiae on the extremities or trunk (see <a href="c29-sec09.xhtml#ff29-4">Fig. 29-4</a>). Patients who experience only bruising and petechiae tend to have fewer complications from bleeding than those with bleeding from mucosal surfaces, such as the GI tract and respiratory system (sometimes described as &#x201C;wet purpura&#x201D;). Patients with wet purpura have a greater risk of life-threatening bleeding which requires immediate aggressive treatment to reduce complications (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Diz-Kucukkaya &#x0026; Lopez, 2016</a>). Severe thrombocytopenia, characterized by platelet count less than 20,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, a prior history of minor bleeding episodes, and advanced age, is a risk factor for severe bleeding. Despite low platelet counts, platelets are typically immature yet very functional, with the ability to adhere to endothelial surfaces and each other. This may explain why spontaneous bleeding does not always occur. Treatment is not necessary unless bleeding becomes severe or if surgery or another invasive procedure is required (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Diz-Kucukkaya &#x0026; Lopez, 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1158">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A careful history and physical examination are essential to aid in excluding other causes of thrombocytopenia and identify sites of bleeding. Patients should be tested for hepatitis C and HIV, if not previously done to rule them out as potential causes. Bone marrow aspirate may reveal an increased number of megakaryocytes. The severity of the thrombocytopenia is highly variable.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>H. pylori</em> infection is associated with ITP, and treatment to eradicate the infection may improve the platelet count. The correlation between <em>H. pylori</em> infection and ITP is not clear; it is postulated that the presence of the <em>H. pylori</em> organism may stimulate an autoimmune reaction (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2109">Aljarad, Alhamid, Tarabishi, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1159">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The primary goal of treatment is to achieve a platelet count high enough to maintain hemostasis. Because the risk for bleeding does not typically increase until the platelet count is less than 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, a patient whose platelet count exceeds 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup> to 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> may be carefully monitored without immediate intervention. However, if the platelet count is less than 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup> or if bleeding occurs, the goal is to improve the patient&#x2019;s platelet count and not to cure the disease. The decision to treat is made based upon the severity of bleeding (if any) and not solely on the platelet count. Potential treatment side effects, the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle, activity level, concurrent use of medications, and treatment preferences are also considered. A person with a sedentary lifestyle can tolerate a low platelet count more safely than a more active person; however, increasing age is also associated with increased risk for bleeding and mortality (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Diz-Kucukkaya &#x0026; Lopez, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment for ITP usually involves several approaches. If the patient is taking a medication known to be associated with ITP (e.g., quinine, sulfa-containing drugs), then that medication should be discontinued. Transfusions are often ineffective because antiplatelet antibodies bind with transfused platelets, causing them to be destroyed. Platelet counts may drop even further after platelet transfusion. Thus, despite extremely low platelet counts, platelet transfusions may result in catastrophic bleeding in patients with wet purpura. Aminocaproic acid, a fibrinolytic enzyme inhibitor that slows the dissolution of blood clots, may be useful for patients with significant mucosal bleeding that is resistant to other treatments.</p>

<p class="indent">The mainstay of short-term therapy is the use of immunosuppressive agents. These agents block the binding receptors on macrophages to reduce platelet destruction. The American Society of Hematology recommends dexamethasone or prednisone in adults with newly diagnosed ITP as the types of corticosteroids that might be selected for initial therapy. Continuous long-term use of corticosteroids is not recommended because of the risk for side effects (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2163">Neunert, Terrell, Arnold, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Platelet counts typically begin to rise within a few days after initiating treatment with corticosteroids. The platelet count tends to decrease once the corticosteroid dose is tapered but may remain sufficiently adequate to prevent bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">IVIG is commonly used to treat ITP. It renders its effect by binding to the receptors on macrophages. However, the need for high doses of IVIG and its high cost are disadvantages.</p>

<p class="indent">The effects of treatment are transient in most cases. Another approach to treatment of chronic ITP is the use of anti-D immunoglobulin in patients who are Rh (D) positive. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it is theorized that the anti-D binds to the patient&#x2019;s erythrocytes, which are in turn destroyed by the body&#x2019;s macrophages. The receptors in the RES may become flooded with sensitized erythrocytes, which then reduce the number of antibody-coated platelets. This then results in a transient reduction of hematocrit and an increased number of platelets in some patients with ITP (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2163">Neunert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually, the platelet count again declines and additional therapy is needed. Second-line treatment options should take the patient&#x2019;s individual needs and the potential treatment-related side effects into account.</p>
<p class="indent">Splenectomy is an alternative treatment and typically results in a sustained increase in platelets. Many patients can maintain a &#x201C;safe&#x201D; platelet count of more than 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup> after splenectomy; however, many patients may have a recurrence of thrombocytopenia months or years later (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2163">Neunert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Patients who undergo splenectomy are permanently at risk for serious infection and should receive pneumococcal, influenzae, and meningococcal vaccines approximately 2 weeks prior to splenectomy, or 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively if splenectomy is performed emergently (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2116">Bonanni, Grazzini, Niccolai, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>) (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for information on pneumonia vaccine).</p>
<p class="indent">Other management strategies include use of monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab. Patients may have long lasting effects with increased platelet counts for up to 1 year after treatment. Unfortunately, when the response dwindles, platelets may fall to unsafe levels, making additional treatment necessary (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2163">Neunert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Two thrombopoietin receptor agonists are available for treatment of refractory ITP. These include romiplostim and eltromopag. Romiplostim is given as a weekly subcutaneous injection and eltromopag is given orally. The response varies widely, and treatment must be continued indefinitely (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2126">Depr&#x00E9;, Aboud, Ringel, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1160">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care includes a thorough assessment of the patient&#x2019;s lifestyle to determine risks for bleeding associated with activities. A careful medication history should also be obtained, including use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbs, and nutritional supplements. The nurse must be alert to sulfa-containing medications and others that may interfere with platelet function (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDs). The nurse must assess for a history of recent viral illness and reports of headache, visual disturbances, and other symptoms that may indicate intracranial bleeding. Patients admitted to the hospital with wet purpura and low platelet counts should have neurologic assessment included with their vital sign measurements. Injections and rectal medications should be avoided. Rectal temperature measurements should also be avoided because they may cause trauma to the rectal mucosa and stimulate bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">There is evidence that patients with ITP experience an increase in fatigue when compared to those without the disease that is not associated with the duration of the disease, corticosteroid use, bleeding, or low platelet counts (<a href="c29-sec24.xhtml#bib2196">Diz-Kucukkaya &#x0026; Lopez, 2016</a>). Assessment of the extent of the patient&#x2019;s fatigue can be beneficial in helping the patient to identify coping strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient and family education should address signs of exacerbation (e.g., petechiae and ecchymoses), how to contact appropriate health care personnel, the name and type of medications inducing ITP (if appropriate) current medical treatment (name of medications, side effects, tapering schedule, if indicated), frequency of monitoring for the platelet count, and follow-up appointments.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient should be instructed to avoid all agents that interfere with platelet function, including herbal therapies and OTC medications. The patient should avoid constipation, straining, and vigorous flossing of the teeth. Electric razors should be used for shaving and soft-bristled toothbrushes should be used for dental hygiene. Patients and their partners should be counseled to avoid vigorous sexual intercourse when platelet counts are low. Patients who are receiving long-term corticosteroids should understand that they are at increased risk for complications including osteoporosis, proximal muscle wasting, cataract formation, and dental caries (see <a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#tt45-3">Chapter 45, Table 45-3</a>). Bone mineral density should be monitored, and patients may benefit from supplemental calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonate to reduce risk for significant bone disease.</p>
