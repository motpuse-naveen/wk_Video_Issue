<p class="CSMTXTMFIRST"><span class="dropcaps6">A</span> 66-year-old woman is receiving a course of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the infusion center where you work. You note that upon arrival the patient is short of breath, her SpO<sub>2</sub> is 88% on room air, and her heart rate is regular at 104&#x00A0;bpm. Her chemotherapy infusion is placed on hold and laboratory tests reveal she has anemia. Upon initiation of chemotherapy, all patients receive education about strategies to help avoid complications such as anemia, bleeding, and infection. Earlier in the week another patient had their chemotherapy held due to an infection. You wonder if you should consider a different type of intervention aimed at decreasing complications of chemotherapy.</p>

<p class="UMTAMFirst">The complexities inherent in today&#x2019;s health care system challenge nurses to demonstrate integration of specific interdisciplinary core competencies. These competencies are aimed at ensuring the delivery of safe, quality patient care (Institute of Medicine, 2003). The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses project (Cronenwett, Sherwood, Barnsteiner, et al., 2007; QSEN, 2020) provides a framework for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) required for nurses to demonstrate competency in these key areas, which include <strong><em>patient-centered care</em></strong>, <strong><em>interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration</em></strong>, <strong><em>evidence-based practice</em></strong>, <strong><em>quality improvement</em></strong>, <strong><em>safety</em></strong>, and <strong><em>informatics.</em></strong></p>
<p class="UMTA"><span class="redb">Quality Improvement Definition:</span> Use data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and use improvement methods to design and test changes to continuously improve the quality and safety of health care systems.</p>
