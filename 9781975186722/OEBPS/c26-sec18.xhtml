<p class="nonindent">The lymphatic system consists of a set of vessels that spread throughout most of the body, as described previously in this chapter. The fluid drained from the interstitial space by the lymphatic system is called <em>lymph.</em> The flow of lymph depends on the intrinsic contractions of the lymph vessels, the contraction of muscles, respiratory movements, and gravity. The lymphatic system of the abdominal cavity maintains a steady flow of chyle (digested fatty food) from the intestinal mucosa to the thoracic duct. In other parts of the body, the lymphatic system&#x2019;s function is regional; the lymphatic vessels of the head, for example, empty into clusters of lymph nodes located in the neck, and those of the extremities empty into nodes of the axillae and the groin.</p>
