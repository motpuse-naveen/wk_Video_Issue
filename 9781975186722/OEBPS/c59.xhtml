<p class="nonindent">The ear is a delicate sensory organ with the dual functions of hearing and balance. The sense of hearing is essential for normal development and maintenance of speech as well as the ability to communicate with others. Balance, or equilibrium, is essential for maintaining body movement, position, and coordination.</p>
<p class="indent">The early detection and accurate diagnosis of disorders is necessary for preservation of normal hearing and balance. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders requires skilled health care professionals such as otolaryngologists, internists, audiologists, and nurses. This chapter provides an overview of the anatomy and physiology of the ear and addresses the general assessment and management of hearing and balance disorders common to adults seen in many health care settings.</p>
