<h4 class="h4" id="s1868">Surgical Procedure</h4>
<p class="nonindent">During the procedure, the donor liver is freed from other structures, the bile is flushed from the gallbladder to prevent damage to the walls of the biliary tract, and the liver is perfused with a preservative and cooled. Before the donor liver is placed in the recipient, it is flushed with cold lactated Ringer solution to remove potassium and air bubbles. The presence of portal hypertension increases the difficulty of the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Anastomoses (connections) of the blood vessels and bile duct are performed between the donor liver and the recipient liver. There are two types of biliary anastomoses. Biliary reconstruction is performed with an end-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient common bile ducts; a stented T-tube may be inserted for external drainage of bile. In patients with biliary disease such as primary sclerosing cholangitis <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1409" title="1409"></span>or if the recipient&#x2019;s bile duct is not suitable for anastomosis for other reasons, a biliary-enteric end-to-side anastomosis with a 40- to 50-cm Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum is created for biliary drainage (known as a Roux-en-Y procedure) (see <a href="#ff43-14">Fig. 43-14</a>A); in this case, bile drainage is internal, and a T-tube is not inserted (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>). Figure 43-14B,C illustrates the final appearance of the grafted liver and final closure and one method of drain placement. Some transplant centers may use fewer drains.</p>

<p class="indent">Several additional techniques have been developed to expand the donor pool for liver transplantation. In a split-liver transplant, a single organ is used to provide grafts for two individuals with ESLD, with the smaller patient receiving the smaller left lobe. This procedure has resulted in a higher complication rate and lower survival rate than traditional liver transplantation. Living donor transplantation is being increasingly performed from adult to adult using full right lobes, although it is controversial because it is a major surgical procedure for the donor, and some donor deaths have occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is considered for patients who have a high potential for mortality while awaiting a deceased liver donor, such as those patients with HCC or those with severe complications of cirrhosis including GI bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>). The results thus far have indicated that this procedure is most successful when donor and recipient are appropriately selected using careful screening criteria (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>). The option of LDLT decreases the waiting list mortality and produces positive recipient outcomes with a low risk of morbidity and mortality for the donor. The LDLT procedure involves transplantation of the right hepatic lobe from an adult donor to the recipient. Potential donors are evaluated by a donor advocate team. Donors must be completely healthy and have hepatic size and anatomy compatible with right lobe transplantation (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>). There is an extensive informed consent process for live liver donors. The donor advocate ensures that the concern for donor safety is paramount, especially in the intra- and postoperative period when complications can occur. The clear separation of donor and recipient teams ensures that the donor is treated without ulterior motives, which might occur if the same team cared for both the donor and recipient.</p>
<p class="indent">In the LDLT procedure, the surgeon performs a formal right hepatic lobectomy. The right lobe is then flushed with preservative solution and vascular reconstruction is completed to prepare for implantation. The recipient operation involves an inferior vena cava&#x2013;sparing hepatectomy with anastomosis of the donor right-sided vascular and biliary structures to the corresponding recipient structures (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Liver transplantation is a long surgical procedure, partly because the patient with liver failure often has portal hypertension, requiring ligation of many venous collateral vessels. Blood loss during the surgical procedure may be extensive. If the patient has adhesions from previous abdominal surgery, lysis of adhesions is often necessary. If a shunt procedure was performed previously, it must be surgically reversed to permit adequate portal venous blood supply to the new liver. During the lengthy surgery, it is important to provide regular updates to the family about the progress of the operation and the patient&#x2019;s status.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1869">Complications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The postoperative complication rate is high, primarily because of technical complications or infection. Immediate postoperative complications may include bleeding, infection, and rejection. Disruption, infection, obstruction of the biliary anastomosis, and impaired biliary drainage may occur. Vascular thrombosis and stenosis are other potential complications. These complications occur in patients receiving either a deceased donor or live donor organ. Despite the development of some complications, the 1-year patient survival rate approaches 90%, and the 5-year patient survival rate is approximately 80% (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Bleeding</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bleeding is common in the postoperative period and may result from coagulopathy, portal hypertension, and fibrinolysis <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1410" title="1410"></span>caused by ischemic injury to the donor liver. Hemodynamic instability and transient hypotension may occur in this phase, secondary to blood loss, loss of vasomotor tone, and vasodilatation due to rewarming the hypothermic patient or due to preexisting cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Goldman &#x0026; Schafer, 2019</a>). Administration of platelets, fresh-frozen plasma, or other blood products may be necessary. Hypertension may co-occur postoperatively but is more common later in the postoperative phase, although its cause is uncertain. Currently available hypertension guidelines do not have specific recommendations for management in the liver transplant population. However, calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine or amlodipine are frequently used for their vasodilatory effects and are the agents of choice. These drugs also are preferable due to their low interaction level with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system with resultant minimal risk of disruption of immunosuppressant levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and ARB medications are not first-line drugs for the treatment of hypertension during the first year after transplant due to low levels of renin during this time period. Thiazide diuretics are reserved for patients requiring more than one medication for blood pressure control (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). Blood pressure elevation that is significant or sustained is also managed with lifestyle modifications, a low-sodium diet, and an exercise regimen.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Infection is the leading cause of death after liver transplantation. Pulmonary and fungal infections are common; susceptibility to infection is increased by the immunosuppressive therapy that is needed to prevent rejection (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). Therefore, precautions must be taken to prevent health care&#x2013;associated infections. The nurse uses strict asepsis when manipulating central venous catheters, arterial lines, and urine, bile, and other drainage systems; obtaining specimens; and changing dressings. Meticulous hand hygiene is crucial. In the ICU, the nurse vigilantly monitors for early clinical manifestations of sepsis (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="c11-sec06.xhtml#ct11-6">Chart 11-6</a>) and uses evidence-based practice guidelines (or bundles) developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) in the care of the postoperative liver transplant patient. Some of these care guidelines include prevention of sepsis through prevention of central line&#x2013;associated bloodstream infections and its rapid treatment (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="c11-sec03.xhtml#ct11-2">Chart 11-2</a>) and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c19-sec04.xhtml#ct19-6">Chart 19-6</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Rejection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Rejection is a major concern. A transplanted liver is perceived by the immune system as a foreign antigen. This triggers an immune response, leading to the activation of T lymphocytes that attack and destroy the transplanted liver. Immunosuppressive agents are used as long-term therapy to prevent this response and rejection of the transplanted liver. These agents inhibit the activation of immunocompetent T lymphocytes to prevent the production of effector T-cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the 1- and 5-year survival rates have increased dramatically with the use of new immunosuppressive therapies, these advances are not without major side effects. A major side effect of cyclosporine, which has been widely used in transplantation, is nephrotoxicity; this problem seems to be dose related. Cyclosporine-related side effects have caused many transplant centers to use tacrolimus instead as first-line therapy because of its efficacy and lower side-effect profile.</p>
<p class="indent">Corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, antithymocyte globulin, basiliximab, and daclizumab are also used in various regimens of immunosuppression. These agents may be used as the initial therapy to prevent rejection or used later to treat rejection. Liver biopsy and ultrasound may be required to evaluate suspected episodes of rejection.</p>
<p class="indent">Retransplantation is usually attempted if the transplanted liver fails, but the success rate of retransplantation does not approach that of initial transplantation. The greater rates of organ dysfunction and loss after a second or third liver transplant are related to technical intraoperative difficulties and higher bleeding risk (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Complications of the LDLT Donor</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Improved surgical techniques have made the LDLT procedure an increasingly safe one; however, complications do occur for donors as well. The most frequently occurring complications include pulmonary emboli, portal vein thrombosis, bile duct injury, and liver insufficiency secondary to a resection that is too extensive (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1870">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient considering transplantation, together with the family, must make difficult choices about treatment, the use of financial resources, and relocation to another area to be closer to the medical center. They must also be aware of the risks and benefits of the procedure and its consequences. In addition, they must also cope with the patient&#x2019;s long-standing health problems and any social and family problems associated with behaviors that may have caused the patient&#x2019;s liver failure. As a result, considerable emotional stress occurs while the patient and family consider liver transplantation and wait for an available liver. The nurse must be aware of these issues and attuned to the emotional and psychological status of the patient and family. Referral to a psychiatric liaison nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist, or spiritual advisor may help them cope with the stressors associated with ESLD and liver transplantation.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient and family are considering undergoing an LDLT, they are subject to additional stressors. Both the patient and the potential donor must undergo a thorough and exhaustive physical and psychological workup to ensure that all involved parties are physically and emotionally prepared. Often, but not always, the donor is a close family member. Coercion must be excluded as influencing the decision to donate a portion of one&#x2019;s liver to another. The potential donor must be aware of the risks associated with the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient and family believe that liver transplantation may be appropriate, the nurse, surgeon, hepatologist, and other health care team members provide the patient and family with full explanations about the procedure, the chances of success, and the risks (for the donor&#x2014;bleeding and venous thromboembolism), including the side effects of long-term <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1411" title="1411"></span>immunosuppression and postoperative complications in the recipient as well as bleeding and biliary abnormalities (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Cameron &#x0026; Cameron, 2020</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). The need for close follow-up and lifelong adherence to the therapeutic regimen, including immunosuppression, is emphasized to the patient and family.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preoperative Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Once the patient has been accepted as a candidate, they are placed on a waiting list at the transplant center, and patient information is entered into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computer system. The UNOS system uses the MELD score to determine organ allocation priorities so that the patient with the highest MELD score will receive the first available organ. Candidates may be matched with appropriate organs as they become available. MELD scores provide the necessary information regarding medical need.</p>
<p class="indent">Except in the case of LDLT, a liver becomes available for transplantation only with the death of another person, usually someone who had been healthy except for severe brain injury and brain death. Therefore, the patient and family undergo a stressful waiting period, and the nurse is often their major source of support. The patient must be accessible at all times in case an appropriate liver becomes available. During this time, liver function may deteriorate further, and the patient may experience complications from the progressing disease. Because of the shortage of donor organs, many patients die awaiting transplantation.</p>
<p class="indent">Malnutrition, massive ascites, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances are treated before surgery to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. If the patient&#x2019;s liver dysfunction has a very rapid onset, as in ALF, there is little time or opportunity for the patient to consider and weigh options and their consequences; the patient may be in a coma and the decision to proceed with transplantation made by the family.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse coordinator is an integral member of the transplant team and plays an important role in preparing the patient for liver transplantation. The nurse serves as an advocate for the patient and family and assumes the important role of liaison between the patient and the other members of the transplant team. The nurse also serves as a resource to other nurses and health care team members involved in evaluating and caring for the patient.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/icon17.jpg" alt=""/> Postoperative Nursing Interventions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The organ recipient is maintained in an environment as free from bacteria, viruses, and fungi as possible, because immunosuppressive medications reduce the body&#x2019;s natural defenses. In the immediate postoperative period, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, and metabolic functions are monitored continuously. Mean arterial and pulmonary artery pressures are also monitored continuously. Cardiac output, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, oxygen saturation, oxygen demand and delivery, urine output, heart rate, and blood pressure are used to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic status and intravascular fluid volume. Liver function tests, electrolyte levels, the coagulation profile, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and fluid output (including urine, bile from the T-tube, and drainage from Jackson&#x2013;Pratt tubes) are monitored closely. Because the liver is responsible for the storage of glycogen and the synthesis of protein and clotting factors, these substances need to be monitored and replaced in the immediate postoperative period.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a high risk of atelectasis and an altered ventilation&#x2013;perfusion ratio caused by insult to the diaphragm during the surgical procedure, prolonged anesthesia, immobility, and postoperative pain. The patient may have an endotracheal tube in place and require mechanical ventilation during the initial postoperative period. Suctioning is performed as required, and sterile humidification is provided. Evidence-based practice guidelines are implemented to prevent the development of pneumonia in the postoperative liver transplant recipient (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c19-sec04.xhtml#ct19-6">Chart 19-6</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">As the patient&#x2019;s condition stabilizes, efforts are made to promote recovery from the trauma of this complex surgery. After removal of the endotracheal tube, the nurse encourages the patient to use an incentive spirometer to decrease the risk of atelectasis (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c19-sec02.xhtml#ct19-1">Chart 19-1</a> for further details on incentive spirometry). Following extubation, the patient is assisted to get out of bed, to ambulate as tolerated, and to participate in self-care to prevent the complications associated with immobility (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3303">Pearson, Mangold, Kosiorek, et al., 2018</a>). Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction and rejection continue throughout the hospital stay. Plans are made for close follow-up after discharge as well. Education is initiated during the preoperative period and continues after surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">The live donor is frequently admitted to an ICU setting along with the recipient. The donor also requires close monitoring for cardiovascular, hemodynamic, and pulmonary stability. The nurse closely assesses the donor for signs of hemorrhage, biliary complication, respiratory decompensation, and infection. The donor is mobilized early in the postoperative phase to prevent the development of complications such as pulmonary embolism. Studies suggest that the donor may experience more pain than the recipient, possibly requiring more analgesia for pain control (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Friedman &#x0026; Martin, 2018</a>). Patient education focuses on prevention and recognition of complications as well as activity progression and pain management.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Educating the patient, family, and caregivers about long-term measures to promote health is crucial for the success of transplantation and is an important role of the nurse. The patient and family must understand why they need to adhere closely to the therapeutic regimen, with special emphasis on the methods of administration, rationale, and side effects of the prescribed immunosuppressive agents. The nurse provides written and verbal education about how and when to take the medications. To avoid running out of medication or skipping a dose, the patient must make sure that an adequate supply of medication is available. Education is provided about the signs and symptoms that indicate problems necessitating consultation with the transplant team. The patient with a T-tube in place must be educated about how to manage the tube, drainage, and skin care.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1412" title="1412"></span></p>

<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong><strong>Psychosocial Adjustments in Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation</strong></strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Y&#x0131;ld&#x0131;z, E., &#x0026; K&#x0131;l&#x0131;n&#x00E7;, G. (2018). The relationship between anxietydepression status and psychosocial adjustments in the patients undergoing liver transplantation. <em>Perspectives in Psychiatric Care</em>, <em>54</em>(2), 221&#x2013;229.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the anxiety-depression status and psychosocial adjustments in patients undergoing liver transplantation.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This was a descriptive correlational study conducted with 90 participants who received a liver transplant in one transplant facility in Turkey. The participants included in the study were administered two questionnaires, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Self Report (PAIS).</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The study found that as the anxiety risk of participants increased, their adjustments to their domestic and psychological environments were negatively affected.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndenta">In younger participants, the risk of experiencing anxiety increased and psychological adjustment to undergoing liver transplantation decreased. Women had a greater risk of anxiety. Most participants showed low psychosocial adjustment after liver transplantation, but this was most pronounced in those who were single, had a moderate socioeconomic level, and who were employed.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">A psychiatric assessment is one element of the intensive preoperative evaluation of patients prior to undergoing liver transplantation. Psychiatric nurse practitioners may take part in such evaluations, and this information is important to have not only in the preoperative realm but after surgery should patients experience anxiety. It is important that patients are able to adjust socially and psychologically to their life changes after liver transplantation. Nurses are key participants in identifying methods to alleviate anxiety and improve coping strategies. Nurses provide encouragement for patients to participate in self-care activities that can promote effective psychosocial adjustment. Some of the patient education and support that is carried out preoperatively may facilitate this adjustment postoperatively.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndenta">Coordinating an effective plan with the interprofessional team, including psychiatric professionals, is part of the nursing role in caring for recipients of liver transplants and in helping these patients to achieve seamless transitions, less anxiety, and optimum levels of adjustment.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Following liver transplantation, the patient experiences a period of psychosocial adjustment (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Ko, Muehrer, &#x0026; Bratzke, 2018</a>; <a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3322">Y&#x0131;ld&#x0131;z, &#x0026; K&#x0131;l&#x0131;n&#x00E7;, 2018</a>). The nurse educates patients and caregivers to be alert for signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression and to report them to the transplant team so that appropriate referrals can be made for treatment as needed. See the Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct43-11">Chart 43-11</a>.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse emphasizes the importance of follow-up laboratory tests and appointments with the transplant team. Trough blood levels of immunosuppressive agents are obtained, along with other blood tests that assess the function of the liver and kidneys. During the first months, the patient is likely to require blood tests two or three times a week. As the patient&#x2019;s condition stabilizes, laboratory studies and visits to the transplant team are less frequent. The importance of routine ophthalmologic examinations is emphasized because of the increased incidence of cataracts and glaucoma associated with the long-term corticosteroid therapy used with transplantation. Regular oral hygiene and follow-up dental care, with administration of prophylactic antibiotics before dental examinations and treatments, are recommended because of the immunosuppression.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse reminds the patient that preventing rejection and infection is essential and increases the chances for survival and a more normal life than before transplantation. Many patients live successful and productive lives after receiving a liver transplant. Pregnancy may be considered after transplantation but it is not without risks. Despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, increasing experience in the management of pregnancy after liver transplantation and some successful outcomes, these pregnancies are considered high risk for both mother and infant and referral should be made to a high-risk pregnancy center well before conception (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3282">Baskiran, Karakas, Ince, et al., 2017</a>). Transplant recipients should be advised about birth control. The waiting period allows time to establish good health, stable liver function, and lower maintenance levels of immunosuppressive therapy (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Baskiran et al., 2017</a>).</p>
