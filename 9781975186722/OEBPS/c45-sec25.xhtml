<h4 class="h4" id="s2009">Primary Aldosteronism</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The principal action of aldosterone is to conserve body sodium. Under the influence of this hormone, the kidneys excrete less sodium and more potassium and hydrogen. Primary aldosteronism is also known as Conn syndrome. Etiologic factors for primary aldosteronism include tumors of the adrenal gland, ovarian tumors that secrete aldosterone, and a family history. The true incidence of primary aldosteronism is unknown (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ma &#x0026; Baranski, 2019</a>) but studies have indicated that it is underestimated (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3420">Monticone, Burrello, Tizzani, et al., 2017</a>). Excessive production of aldosterone causes a distinctive pattern of biochemical changes and a corresponding set of clinical manifestations that are diagnostic of this condition.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2010">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is the most prominent and almost universal sign of primary aldosteronism. Patients with uncomplicated, complicated, and treatment-resistant hypertension and hypertension with hypokalemia should be considered at risk for this disorder. However, hypokalemia should no longer be considered a requisite for this diagnosis. It is now recognized that hypokalemia occurs in less than half of the patients (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ma &#x0026; Baranski, 2019</a>). If hypokalemia is present, it may be responsible for the variable muscle weakness or paralysis, cramping, and fatigue in patients with aldosteronism, as well as the kidneys&#x2019; inability to acidify or concentrate the urine. Accordingly, the urine volume is excessive, leading to polyuria. Serum, by contrast, becomes abnormally concentrated, contributing to polydipsia (excessive thirst) and arterial hypertension. A secondary increase in blood volume and possible direct effects of aldosterone on nerve receptors, such as the carotid sinus, are other factors that result in hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypokalemic alkalosis may decrease the ionized serum calcium level and predispose the patient to tetany <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1483" title="1483"></span>and paresthesias. Chvostek and Trousseau signs may be used to assess neuromuscular irritability before overt paresthesia and tetany occur. Glucose intolerance may occur, because hypokalemia interferes with insulin secretion from the pancreas.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2011">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Withholding antihypertensive medication before laboratory testing is not required. If the patient is taking an antihypertensive agent, this information should be considered when interpreting the results of the PAC/PRA (plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity) study as well as the ARR (aldosterone-renin ratio) (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ma &#x0026; Baranski, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2012">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The recommended treatment of unilateral primary aldosteronism is total surgical removal of the adrenal tumor through laparoscopic adrenalectomy rather than open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter hospital stays and generally fewer complications following surgery (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ma &#x0026; Baranski, 2019</a>). During the preoperative period, blood pressure and potassium levels are closely monitored. During the immediate postoperative period, the patient is susceptible to fluctuations in adrenocortical hormones and requires administration of corticosteroids, fluids, and other agents to maintain blood pressure and prevent acute complications. If the adrenalectomy is bilateral, replacement of corticosteroids will be lifelong. A normal serum glucose level is maintained with insulin, appropriate IV fluids, and dietary modifications. Hypokalemia typically resolves for all patients after surgery and hypertension is resolved in 35% to 60%. Postoperatively, spironolactone and potassium supplements should be discontinued and antihypertensives should be decreased. Potassium levels should be checked once a week for 4 weeks postoperatively (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ma &#x0026; Baranski, 2019</a>). Medical treatment rather than surgery is recommended for patients with bilateral adrenal involvement due to poor blood pressure control and other risks.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacologic management is required for patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or unilateral aldosterone hypersecretion who do not undergo surgery. Spironolactone is recommended as the first-line drug to control hypertension. Eplerenone, a more expensive drug, is recommended as a second-line drug if the patient cannot tolerate side effects of spironolactone (<a href="c45-sec26.xhtml#bib3438">Ma &#x0026; Baranski, 2019</a>). Serum potassium and creatinine should be monitored frequently during the first 4 to 6 weeks of taking spironolactone. Ongoing monitoring will be determined by the clinical course. The half-life of digoxin may be increased when taken with spironolactone, and its dosage may need to be adjusted.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2013">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management in the postoperative period includes frequent assessment of vital signs to detect early signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and crisis or hemorrhage. Explaining all treatments and procedures, providing comfort measures, and providing rest periods can reduce the patient&#x2019;s stress and anxiety level.</p>
