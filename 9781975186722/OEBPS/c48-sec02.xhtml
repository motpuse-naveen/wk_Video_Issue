CKD is associated with decreased quality of life, increased health care expenditures, and premature death. Untreated CKD can result in <strong>end-stage kidney disease (ESKD</strong>, formerly known as end-stage renal disease [ESRD]), which is the final stage of CKD. ESKD results in retention of uremic waste products and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), such as dialysis or kidney transplantation (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Chicca, 2020</a>). Risk factors include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.</p>

<p class="indent">Recent research reported that 15% of the adult U.S. population, 37 million people or 1 in 7 individuals, have CKD and 9 of 10 affected individuals are unaware of their disease (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3535">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019</a>). On December 31, 2017, there were more than 746,000 Americans diagnosed with ESKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3561">United States Renal Data System [USRDS], 2019</a>). The majority of people with CKD will die of a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) prior to reaching ESKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Subbiah, Chhabra, &#x0026; Mahajan, 2016</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Diabetes and hypertension cause approximately 70% of cases of CKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Chicca, 2020</a>). About one in three adults with diabetes may have CKD (CDC, 2019). Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease in patients starting RRT. About one in five adults with hypertension may have CKD (CDC, 2019). Other causes include glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis; polycystic, hereditary, or congenital disorders; and renal cancers.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2102">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the early stages of CKD, there can be significant damage to the kidneys without signs or symptoms. The pathophysiology of CKD is not yet clearly understood, but the damage to the kidneys is thought to be caused by prolonged acute inflammation that is not organ specific and thus has subtle systemic manifestations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2103">Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">CKD has been classified into five stages by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) (see <a href="#ct48-1">Chart&#x00A0;48-1</a>). Stage 5 results <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1557" title="1557"></span>when the kidneys cannot remove the body&#x2019;s metabolic wastes or perform their regulatory functions; thus, RRT is required to sustain life. Screening and early intervention are important, because not all patients progress to stage 5 CKD. Patients with CKD are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Carey &#x0026; Whelton, 2018</a>). Treatment of hypertension, anemia, and hyperglycemia and detection of proteinuria all help to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Brooks, 2017</a>).</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2104">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Elevated serum creatinine levels indicate underlying kidney disease; as the creatinine level increases, symptoms of CKD begin. Those with CKD are one of the most symptomatic groups among patients with chronic diseases (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Kalfoss, Schick-Makaroff, &#x0026; Molzahn, 2019</a>). Anemia, due to decreased erythropoietin production by the kidney, metabolic acidosis, and abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus balance herald the development of CKD (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Brooks, 2017</a>). Fluid retention, evidenced by both edema and congestive heart failure, develops. As the disease progresses, abnormalities in electrolytes occur, heart failure worsens, and hypertension becomes more difficult to control, often due to fluid volume excess (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3546">Ku, Lee, Wei, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2105">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong>glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</strong> is the amount of plasma filtered through the glomeruli per unit of time. Creatinine clearance is a measure of the amount of creatinine the kidneys are able to clear in a 24-hour period. Normal values differ in men and women. Calculation of GFR, an important assessment parameter in CKD, is discussed in <a href="c47.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2106">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The management of patients with CKD includes treatment of the underlying causes. Regular clinical and laboratory assessment is important to keep the blood pressure below 125 to 130/80 mm Hg (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Ku et al., 2019</a>). Controlling cardiovascular risk factors, treating hyperglycemia, managing anemia, encouraging smoking cessation, weight loss, and exercise programs as well as reducing salt and alcohol intake and minimizing nephrotoxins all slow progression toward ESKD. Medical management also includes early referral for initiation of RRT as indicated by the patient&#x2019;s renal status. Patient engagement and education are essential as many of these factors are under the patient&#x2019;s control.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2107"> <img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Changes in kidney function with normal aging increase the susceptibility of older patients to kidney dysfunction and kidney disease (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hain, 2017</a>). With aging, the number of nephrons decline. In addition, the incidence of systemic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, and cancer, increases with advancing age, predisposing older adults to kidney disease associated with these disorders. Therefore, acute problems need to be prevented if possible or recognized and treated quickly to avoid kidney damage. Nurses in all settings need to be alert to signs and symptoms of kidney dysfunction in older patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Older patients frequently take multiple prescription and over-the-counter medications. Because alterations in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and renal clearance increase the risk of medication-associated changes in renal function, precautions are indicated with all medications. When older patients undergo extensive diagnostic tests or when new medications (e.g., diuretic agents) are added, precautions must be taken to prevent dehydration, which can compromise marginal renal function and exacerbate preexisting kidney dysfunction (<a href="c48-sec15.xhtml#bib3574">Hain, 2017</a>).</p>
