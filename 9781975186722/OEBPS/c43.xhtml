<p class="nonindent">Liver function is complex, and hepatic dysfunction affects all body systems. For this reason, the nurse must understand how the liver functions and must have expert clinical assessment and management skills to care for patients undergoing diagnostic and treatment procedures. The nurse also must have an understanding of technologic advances in the management of hepatic disorders. Liver disorders are common and may result from a virus, obesity, insulin resistance, or exposure to toxic substances, such as alcohol, or tumors (<a href="c43-sec28.xhtml#bib3334">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
