<h4 class="h4" id="s1456">The Patient Undergoing Arthroplasty</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In moderate to severe OA, when pain is severe or because of loss of function, surgical intervention may be used. The procedures most commonly used are osteotomy (to alter the distribution of weight within the joint) and arthroplasty. Joint <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;arthroplasty:&lt;/b&gt; surgical replacement of a joint">arthroplasty</button></strong> refers to the surgical removal of an unhealthy joint and replacement of joint surfaces with metal or synthetic materials.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with OA and with severe joint pain and disability may undergo arthroplasty. Other conditions contributing to joint degeneration that might require arthroplasty include RA, trauma, and congenital deformity. Some fractures (e.g., femoral neck fracture) may cause disruption of the blood supply and subsequent <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;avascular necrosis:&lt;/b&gt; death of tissue due to insufficient blood supply">avascular necrosis</button></strong> (death of tissue due to insufficient blood supply); management with joint replacement may be elected over open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>). Joints frequently replaced include the hip, knee (see <a href="#ff36-9">Fig. 36-9</a>), and finger joints. More complex joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle) are replaced less frequently.</p>
<p class="indent">Total joint arthroplasty, also known as total joint replacement, involves the replacement of all components of an articulating joint. Most joint replacements consist of metal (e.g., stainless steel, cobalt-chromium, titanium) and high-density polyethylene components. In order to achieve fixation of components, the material can be cemented, cementless, or a hybrid of both of these materials. Cemented fixation uses a fast-curing bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA]) to hold implants in place. Cementless fixation relies on new <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1125" title="1125"></span>bone growing into the surface of the implant by using a press-fit, porous-coated prosthesis. There is also a hybrid fixation technique for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) where the femoral component is inserted without cement, and the tibial and patellar components are inserted with cement. Use of each of these materials and techniques have different benefits and risks. Current research evidence supports the use of either component fixation methods (cemented or cementless) because postoperative functional outcomes, rates of complications, and rates of reoperations are similar (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn, Murray, Pezold, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). Identifying patient-specific factors that may inform the decision to utilize a particular fixation technique is important. Considerations include gender, age, diagnosis, weight and activity level as well as the presence of healthy bone with adequate blood supply. Issues of cost and cost-effectiveness should also be considered (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">With joint replacement, patients may expect pain relief, return of joint motion, and improved functional status and quality of life. The scope of these improvements depends in part on patients&#x2019; preoperative soft tissue condition and general muscle strength. Serious complications seldom occur, and recent innovations in total joint replacement surgery have made this a safer and more routinely performed surgery. Rehabilitation with physical therapy that is initiated within the first 24 hours is associated with decreased hospital length of stay and improved balance and gait function (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). In addition, minimally invasive surgical techniques, biomaterials, postoperative rehabilitation protocols, and multimodal analgesia strategies have led to earlier hospital discharge and quicker recovery (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Lee, 2016</a>). The American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) monitors the performance of devices and evaluates the cost-effectiveness of procedures. The data generated from the AJRR and other registries provide orthopedic researchers and practitioners with the information necessary to improve the quality of health care among patients in need of knee and hip replacement procedures (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2565">Dy, Bumpass, Makhni, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Annual reports are provided to hospital system members to facilitate quality improvement programs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2543">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons [AAOS], 2020</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1457">Preoperative and Intraoperative Nursing&#x00A0;Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative and intraoperative assessment and management of the patient having arthroplasty are aimed at having the patient in optimal health for surgery (see Chapters 14 and 15). Risks for bleeding, VTE, infection, and pain are managed proactively.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing and Managing Blood Loss</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Until recently, acute postoperative anemia due to perioperative blood loss was a common occurrence in patients having total hip arthroplasty (THA) and TKA; allogeneic blood transfusions (i.e., blood transfused from a donor) were required in up to 50% of patients who had THA and TKA (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2614">Rasouli, Maltenfort, Erkocak, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>). Recent research findings suggest that rate has dropped significantly, to approximately 9% of patients who have THA and 4% for patients who have TKA (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2549">Bedard, Pugely, Lux, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>). This diminished demand for allogeneic blood transfusions is attributable to the following interventions (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Alexander &#x0026; Frew, 2017</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2587">Loftus, Spratling, Stone, et&#x00A0;al., 2016</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Martin &#x0026; Harris, 2020</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2620">Stalenhag &#x0026; Sterner, 2019</a>):</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Appropriate preoperative assessment and treatment of patients with anemia (i.e., low red blood cell counts) with pharmacologic agents, such as epoetin alfa or iron supplements</span></li>
<li><span>Application of pneumatic tourniquets during orthopedic limb surgery (e.g., TKA), which not only minimizes bleeding but also helps maintain a clean surgical field</span></li>
<li><span>Employment of intraoperative red blood cell salvage systems, as appropriate, during procedures when a large volume of blood is lost. This is effectively a type of autologous transfusion; that is, the patient&#x2019;s own blood is salvaged during the operative procedure and re-transfused back to the patient.</span></li>
<li><span>Intraoperative administration of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid, which is thought to have significantly reduced overall blood loss and the need for blood transfusions in patients having THA or TKA.</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Venous Thromboembolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients having orthopedic surgery are particularly at risk for VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Therefore, factors that compound or further increase this risk are assessed preoperatively. Increasing age (older than age 40), obesity, taking prescription hormonal medications, preoperative leg edema, previous history of any VTE, and varicose veins increase the risk for postoperative DVT and PE (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Menaka &#x0026; Douketis, 2019</a>). The use of medications that increase the risk of clotting, such as certain hormones and NSAIDs, may be discontinued a week before surgery. Prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or another anticoagulant agent may be prescribed prior to or after surgery (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessing the neurovascular status of the extremity undergoing joint replacement is important, because postoperative assessment data are compared with preoperative assessment data to identify changes and any arterial impairment to the affected extremity. For example, an absent pulse postoperatively is of concern unless the pulse was also absent preoperatively. Nerve palsy could occur as a result of surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative assessment of the patient for recent or active infections, including urinary tract infection, is necessary because of the risk for postoperative infection. Any infection presenting 2 to 4 weeks before planned surgery may result in postponement of surgery. Preoperative skin preparations, such as showers with antiseptic soap, are recommended the evening before and the morning of surgery. Scrubbing of the surgical site with a prescribed antiseptic soap the night before or on the morning of surgery decreases bacterial count on the skin and helps lower the chance of infection (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2550">Berrios-Torres, Umscheid, Bratzler, et&#x00A0;al., 2017</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2604">Papas, Conguista, Scuderi, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Research findings suggest that prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics given 60 minutes prior to skin incision and discontinued within 24 hours postoperatively are effective in preventing surgical site infections (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2559">De Francesco, Fu, Kalenberg, et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of antibiotic-loaded bone cement and preoperative nasal swabbing to screen for patients who are carriers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1126" title="1126"></span>of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) or methicillin-sensitive <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MSSA) may help in further reducing postoperative infections; the effectiveness of these modalities is under research as is the use of dual antibiotic therapy (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2627">Villa, Pannu, Riesgo, et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>). Culture of the joint during surgery may be important in identifying and treating subsequent infections.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Managing Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Assessment of the patient&#x2019;s pain preoperatively and any cultural and personal preferences are important components related to the control of pain following joint surgery. Assessing the patient&#x2019;s level of understanding of the surgery and explaining what to expect in the postoperative period (e.g., incentive spirometry, pain control methods, activity limits) can improve outcomes. Research findings suggest that patients who are supported and educated telephonically in the preoperative period report better quality of life and well-being postoperatively (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2542">Allsop, Fairhall, &#x0026; Morphet, 2019</a>) (see Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct36-5">Chart 36-5</a>). However, high anxiety and severe pain prior to surgery may have an impact on these outcomes (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2579">Jones, Al-Naseer, Bodger, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1458">Total Hip Arthroplasty</h5>
<p class="nonindent">THA is the replacement of a severely damaged hip with an artificial joint. Indications for this surgery include OA, as well as RA, femoral neck fractures (i.e., hip fracture; see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>), failure of previous reconstructive surgeries, such as a failed prosthesis with osteotomy, and conditions resulting from developmental dysplasia or Legg&#x2013;Calv&#x00E9;&#x2013;Perthes disease (avascular necrosis of the hip in childhood). A variety of total hip prostheses are available. Most consist of a metal femoral component topped by a spherical ball made of metal, ceramic, or plastic that is fitted into a plastic or metal acetabular socket (see <a href="#ff36-9">Fig. 36-9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The surgeon selects the prosthesis that is best suited to the individual patient, considering various factors including skeletal structure and activity level. The patient has irreversibly damaged hip joints, and the potential benefits, including improved quality of life, outweigh the surgical risks. With the advent of improved prosthetic materials and operative techniques, the life of the prosthesis has been extended, and today younger patients with severely damaged and painful hip joints are undergoing total hip replacement.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1459">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse must be aware of and monitor for specific potential complications associated with THA (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2573">Gabbert, Filson, Bodden, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Complications that may occur include dislocation of the hip prosthesis, excessive wound drainage, VTE, infection, and heel pressure injury (see <a href="#ct36-6">Chart 36-6</a>). The nurse also monitors for complications associated with immobility. Long-term complications include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;heterotopic ossification:&lt;/b&gt; misplaced formation of bone">heterotopic ossification</button></strong> (formation of bone in the periprosthetic space), avascular necrosis, and loosening of the prosthesis.</p>

<p class="Box2pRef">Allsop, S., Fairhill, R., &#x0026; Morphet, J. (2019). The impact of pre-operative telephone support and education on symptoms of anxiety, depression, pain and quality of life post total knee replacement. <em>International Journal of Orthopaedic and Trauma Nursing</em>, <em>34</em>, 21&#x2013;27.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients scheduled to have elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can experience anxiety and depression during the preoperative waiting period which may negatively impact postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative patient support and education delivered via telephone would impact postoperative reports of quality of life (QOL), depression, anxiety and pain among patients having total knee replacement surgery.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">This mixed methods study explored the effects of a support intervention in a sample of participants (<em>N</em> = 18) who underwent unilateral total knee replacements. Pre-tests were administered up to 6 weeks prior to elective surgery in the clinic setting. Those with infections, malignancy, or repeat interventions were excluded. Baseline data included demographics and Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMS) which assessed QOL, psychological distress, and pain; using scales previously validated in this population.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Two phone calls were made by the same researcher to address open- and closed-ended questions based on information considered essential for patients to understand before surgery. The researcher individualized content that was delivered to the participants in response to their unique questions and concerns. A thematic analysis was undertaken to identify patterns in responses. The PROMS scales were readministered 6 weeks after surgery, either during a clinic visit or by telephone.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Of the 18 enrolled participants, 16 completed the study. One third were men; 19% lived alone; half of the participants were under 65 years of age and 69% of them were not actively employed. Depression and anxiety (rated as high or very high) were reported by 31% of the patients preoperatively.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Participants&#x2019; concerns related to the administrative processes of admission and discharge and the psychological processing of having a major surgery; some expressed fears of being awake with spinal anesthetic approaches. Participants voiced concerns about their caregivers, the potential for infection, and the wish to return home quickly. Many favorable comments were made concerning the positive impact of the program.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">Fewer participants experienced anxiety and depression post-surgery; however, this change was not significant. There were significant improvements in QOL scores (<em>p</em> = 0.008) and pain scores (<em>p</em> &#x003C; 0.001). However, compared to previous studies (most of which had longer duration of interventions and follow-up), the improvement in QOL, anxiety, and pain scores was not as substantial.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Findings from this study suggest that preoperative telephone support and education of patients scheduled for TKA can improve QOL and pain postoperatively. This study only spanned a 6-week postoperative period, potentially limiting the ability to capture change in study outcomes. This was a single site study which warrants replication in a greater number of facilities with greater attention to the optimal time period required to assess outcomes in this population. In addition, greater attention to more comprehensive psychological interventions preoperatively may also be required for better success in the long term.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Preventing Dislocation of the Hip Prosthesis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For patients undergoing a posterior or posterolateral approach for THA, maintenance of the femoral head component in the acetabular cup is essential. The risk for dislocation is more common with this approach and may occur when the hip is in full flexion, adducted (legs together), and internally rotated. Therefore, correct positioning is maintained at all times. The patient should be in a supine position with the head slightly elevated and the affected leg in a neutral position. The use of an abduction splint, a wedge pillow (see <a href="#ff36-10">Fig. 36-10</a>), or two or three pillows placed between the legs prevent adduction beyond the midline of the body. A cradle boot may be used to prevent leg rotation and to support the heel off the bed, preventing development of a pressure injury. When the nurse turns the patient in bed to the unaffected side, it is important to keep the operative hip in <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;abduction:&lt;/b&gt; movement away from the center or median line of the body">abduction</button></strong> (movement away from the center or median line of the body) (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2573">Gabbert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The patient should not be turned to the operative side, which could cause dislocation, unless specified by the surgeon.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s hip is never flexed more than 90 degrees. When using a fracture bedpan, the nurse instructs the patient to flex the unaffected hip and to use the trapeze to lift the pelvis onto the pan. The patient is also reminded not to flex the affected hip.</p>
<p class="indent">Limited flexion is maintained during transfers and when sitting. When the patient is initially assisted out of bed, an abduction splint or pillows are kept between the legs. The nurse encourages the patient to keep the affected hip in extension, instructing the patient to pivot on the unaffected leg with assistance by the nurse, who protects the affected hip from <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;adduction:&lt;/b&gt; movement toward the center or median line of the body">adduction</button></strong> (movement toward the center or median line of the body), flexion, internal or external rotation, and excessive weight bearing.</p>
<p class="indent">High-seat (orthopedic) chairs with arm rests, semi-reclining chairs, and raised toilet seats are used to minimize hip joint flexion. When sitting, the patient&#x2019;s hips should be higher than the knees. The patient&#x2019;s affected leg should not be elevated when sitting. The patient may flex the knee.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse educates the patient about protective positioning, which includes maintaining abduction and avoiding internal and external rotation, hyperextension, and acute flexion, as described previously. At no time should the patient cross the legs or bend at the waist past 90 degrees (e.g., to put on shoes and socks). Occupational therapists can provide the patient with devices to assist with dressing below the waist. Hip precautions for patients who had a posterior or posterolateral approach for THA should be enforced for 4 months or longer after surgery (see <a href="#ct36-7">Chart 36-7</a>). A patient who has had an anterior surgical approach may not need these precautions. Several studies have reported an anterolateral approach to THA results in a lower rate of dislocation than a posterior approach owing to its ease of access, superior visualization, and a predictable healing pattern. Using a less restrictive mobility protocol in these patients can lead to earlier and better resumption of ADL, earlier return to work, a shorter length of hospital stay, and improved patient satisfaction (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2597">Morris, Fornit, Marchoni, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Dislocation may occur with positioning that exceeds the limits of the prosthesis. The nurse must monitor for signs and symptoms of dislocation of the prosthesis, which include:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Increased pain at the surgical site, swelling, and immobilization</span></li>
<li><span>Acute groin pain in the affected hip or increased discomfort</span></li>
<li><span>Shortening of the affected extremity</span></li>
<li><span>Abnormal external or internal rotation of the affected extremity</span></li>
<li><span>Restricted ability or inability to move the leg</span></li>
<li><span>Reported &#x201C;popping&#x201D; sensation in the hip</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">If any of these clinical manifestations occur, the nurse (or the patient, if at home) immediately notifies the surgeon, because the hip must be reduced and stabilized promptly so that the leg does not sustain circulatory and nerve damage. After closed reduction, the hip may be stabilized with Buck&#x2019;s traction or a brace to prevent recurrent dislocation (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a>, <a href="c37-sec07.xhtml#ff37-11">Fig. 37-11</a>). As the muscles and joint capsule heal, the chance of dislocation diminishes. Stresses to the new hip joint should be avoided for the first 8 to 12 weeks, when the risk of dislocation is greatest (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2573">Gabbert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Ambulation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients begin ambulation with the assistance of a walker or crutches within a day after surgery. The nurse and the physical therapist assist the patient in achieving the goal of independent ambulation. At first, the patient may be able to stand for only a brief period because of orthostatic hypotension. Specific weight-bearing limits on the prosthesis are based on the patient&#x2019;s condition, the procedure, and the fixation method. Weight bearing immediately after surgery may be limited to minimize micromotion of the prosthesis in the bone. As the patient is able to tolerate more activity, the nurse encourages transferring to a chair several times a day for short periods and walking for progressively greater distances.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring Wound Drainage</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fluid and blood accumulating at the surgical site, which could contribute to discomfort and provide a source for infection, may be drained with a closed suction portable suction device. The efficacy of using a wound drainage system is controversial, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1131" title="1131"></span>especially since the system can be a potential source for infection (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Keeney, Austin, &#x0026; Jevsevar, 2019</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2599">Mujagic, Hoffmann, Soysal, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). In particular, drains that remain in place for longer than 24 hours create an increased risk for contamination and infection (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2581">Keeney et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>; <a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2599">Mujagic et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). The nurse should monitor the amount of drainage and measure output each shift; the surgeon must be promptly notified of excessive or foul-smelling drainage. After the drain is removed, the drain tube site is cleaned with an antiseptic solution and a small gauze dressing is applied if there is oozing at the site (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2573">Gabbert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>

<div class="box11">
<p class="Box11pTitle"><strong>Avoiding Hip Dislocation After Arthroplasty with Posterior or Posterolateral Approach</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The nurse instructs the patient to:</p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Until the hip prosthesis stabilizes after hip replacement surgery, it is necessary to follow instructions for proper positioning so that the prosthesis remains in place. Dislocation of the hip is a serious complication of surgery that causes pain and loss of function and necessitates reduction under anesthesia to correct the dislocation. Desirable positions include abduction, neutral rotation, and flexion of less than 90 degrees. When you are seated, the knees should be lower than the hip.</p>
<p class="BoxpPARApIndent">The nurse notes the following methods for avoiding displacement:</p>
<p class="Box11BL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Keep the knees apart at all times.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Put a pillow between the legs when sleeping.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Never cross the legs when seated.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid bending forward when seated in a chair.</p>
<p class="Box11BL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Avoid bending forward to pick up an object on the floor.</p>

<p class="Box11BL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Do not flex the hip to put on clothing such as pants, stockings, socks, or shoes. Positions to avoid after total hip replacement are shown in the illustrations.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Venous Thromboembolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Without prophylaxis, DVT formation can develop within 7 to 14 days following surgery and lead to PE, which can be fatal. Early identification of the patient&#x2019;s VTE risk, ensuring that the patient receives the appropriate prophylaxis, instituting preventive measures, and monitoring the patient closely for clinical signs of the development of DVT and PE are key. However, the nurse should also be aware that VTE prevention may increase the postoperative risk for bleeding and stay alert for this potential complication (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Erens &#x0026; Walter, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Physical signs of DVT include pain and tenderness at or below the area of the clot, swelling or tightness of the affected leg, possibly with pitting edema, with either warmth or cooling, and skin discoloration; PE symptoms may include acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, confusion, and pleuritic chest pain (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">McCance &#x0026; Huether, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Intermittent compression devices are applied either intraoperatively or immediately postoperatively; these devices must remain on the legs at all times, even when the patient is out of bed. Patients should be instructed to dorsi- and plantar flex the ankles and the toes 10 to 20 times every half hour while awake. In addition, patients who are post-THA should be mobilized as soon as possible to assist with decreasing venous stasis; even patients with epidural catheters should stand and ambulate when they are physically able (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Erens &#x0026; Walter, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Aspirin, LMWH and synthetic pentasaccharides (fondaparinux) can be used as prophylaxis for VTE. They typically are continued for up to 35 days following surgery based on surgeon preference and patient risk level (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Menaka &#x0026; Douketis, 2019</a>) (see <a href="c26.xhtml">Chapter 26</a> for further discussion of VTE and VTE prophylaxis).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Infection&#x2014;a serious complication of THA&#x2014;may necessitate removal of the prosthesis. Patients who are older, poorly nourished, smoke cigarettes, or use corticosteroid medications and patients who have obesity, diabetes, RA, concurrent infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, dental abscess), carry MRSA, or have hematomas are at high risk for infection (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2639">Beam &#x0026; Osmon, 2018</a>). Use of two types of antibiotics is being investigated as a method to decrease MRSA infections both in THA and TKA (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2627">Villa et&#x00A0;al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Over time, one in five patients with THA will undergo revision of the prosthesis, most commonly because of aseptic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1132" title="1132"></span>loosening, infection, instability, or a mechanical complication. Because these joint infections are difficult to treat, strategies for preventing infections should be implemented at various steps of the process of care. Strict hand hygiene and utilization of appropriate infection control practices can prevent transmission of infectious organisms. Appropriate antibiotic administration and discontinuation, as well as thorough patient education regarding subsequent antibiotic use are important.</p>

<p class="indent">Acute infections may occur within 3 months after surgery and are associated with progressive superficial infections or hematomas. Delayed surgical infections may appear 4 to 24 months after surgery and may cause return of discomfort in the hip. Routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures for patients with total joint prostheses remains controversial and is not recommended (Goff, Mangino, Glassman, et&#x00A0;al., 2019). Antibiotic prophylaxis can still be prescribed for patients who are immunosuppressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Infections occurring more than 2 years after surgery are attributed to the spread of infection through the bloodstream from another site in the body. If an infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed. Severe infections may require surgical d&#x00E9;bridement or removal of the prosthesis. (See sections on Septic Arthritis and Osteomyelitis later in this chapter.)</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating the Patient About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">Before the patient leaves the acute care setting, the nurse provides thorough education to promote continuity of the therapeutic regimen and active participation in the rehabilitation process (see <a href="#ct36-8">Chart 36-8</a>). The patient may be discharged to the home, a rehabilitation unit, a transitional care unit, or a long-term care facility. The nurse advises the patient of the importance of a daily exercise program in maintaining the functional motion of the hip joint and strengthening the abductor muscles of the hip, and reminds the patient that it will take time to strengthen and retrain the muscles.</p>
<p class="indent">Most patients benefit from physical therapy to regain mobility. Assistive devices (crutches, walker, or cane) may be used for a time. After sufficient muscle tone has developed to permit a normal gait without discomfort, these devices are not necessary. In general, by 3 months, the patient can resume routine ADLs. Stair climbing typically may resume within 3 to 6 weeks following surgery. Some discomfort with activity and at night is common for several weeks. Frequent walks, swimming, and the use of a high rocking chair are excellent for hip exercises.</p>
<p class="indent">Restrictions must be kept in mind when resuming sexual activity. Patients should be questioned about concerns and counseled on physical and functional aspects of sexual activity. Sexual activity can be resumed based upon the surgeon&#x2019;s recommendation (typically 3 to 6 months postoperatively). Attention to positioning and comfort may enhance the intimacy of the experience.</p>
<p class="indent">At no time during the first 4 months should the patient cross the legs or flex the hip more than 90 degrees. Assistive devices should be used for dressing, such as long-handled shoehorns or dressing sticks for putting on shoes and socks. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1133" title="1133"></span>The patient should avoid low chairs and sitting for longer than 45 minutes at a time. These precautions minimize hip flexion and the risks of prosthetic dislocation, hip stiffness, and flexion contracture. Driving requires sufficient range of motion and muscle strength; most patients are given permission to drive 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Traveling long distances should be avoided unless frequent position changes are possible. Other activities to avoid include tub baths, jogging, lifting heavy loads, and excessive bending and twisting (e.g., lifting, shoveling snow, forceful turning). The surgeon may give the patient a card indicating that they have had a joint replacement; this card may be used to alert security personnel who use screening devices at airports or malls.</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">A nurse may assess the patient&#x2019;s home for potential problems and monitor wound healing (see <a href="#ct36-9">Chart 36-9</a>). The nurse, physical therapist, or occupational therapist assesses the home environment for physical barriers that may impede the patient&#x2019;s rehabilitation. In addition, the nurse or therapist may need to assist the patient in acquiring devices such as reachers and long-handled shoehorns or tongs to help with dressing, or a toilet seat extender to elevate the toilet seat. The home rehabilitation program came be done via telehealth (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2566">Eichler, Salzwedel, Rabe, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). After successful surgery and rehabilitation, the patient can expect a hip joint that is free or almost free of pain, has good motion, is stable, and permits normal or near-normal ambulation and function.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/gerontologicconsiderations.png" alt=""/> Gerontologic Considerations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The older adult patient who has had THA merits special postoperative care considerations. Early THA surgery for hip fractures (within 24 to 36 hours) is recommended for most patients once a medical assessment has been made and the patient&#x2019;s condition has been stabilized appropriately. If there are no contraindications (e.g., history of a bleeding disorder), these patients should receive LMWH for VTE prophylaxis; mechanical devices should be used for patients in whom anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are contraindicated. Providing an appropriate postoperative analgesic regimen for older adults can be challenging in the presence of impaired cognition, medical comorbidities, and possible drug interactions. Consulting with a pain management specialist to specifically tailor the analgesic type and dose may be helpful (see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">All older adult patients who are post-THA should be placed on a higher-specification, foam pressure-relieving mattress rather than an air-bed hospital mattress (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2597">Morris et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). A major goal following surgery in this patient population is early mobilization, in an effort to prevent the complications associated with prolonged immobility and to return the patient to functional activity (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2573">Gabbert et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Early assisted mobilization and ambulation on the day of surgery can decrease hospital length of stay, complications, and hospital costs and can prepare patients to care for themselves at home with a higher level of independent functioning. Patients who are assigned to restricted hip precautions have slower rehabilitation and return to usual ADLs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2597">Morris et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>) (see <a href="c37.xhtml">Chapter 37</a> for general discussion of the Postoperative Care of the Patient Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery). Research suggests that use of a telehealth connection to provide rehabilitation remotely has the same level of outcomes as traditional home physical therapy programs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2566">Eichler et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Patients who are assigned to restricted hip precautions have slower rehabilitation and return to usual ADLs (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2597">Morris et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">A TKA is considered for patients whose joint pain cannot be managed by nonsurgical treatment and who have severe pain and functional disability related to destruction of joint surfaces by OA, RA, or posttraumatic (osteonecrotic) arthritis. When activity and mobility severely prevent patients from participating in ADLs, TKA is a successful, cost-effective, low-risk therapy that offers significant pain relief and restores quality of life and function (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). If the patient&#x2019;s ligaments have weakened, a fully constrained (hinged) or semi-constrained prosthesis may be used to provide joint stability. Selection of a nonconstrained prosthesis, characterized by components that are not linked, is dependent upon the patient having healthy and functional ligaments to provide joint stability (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1461">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperatively, the knee is dressed with a compression bandage. Ice or cold packs may be applied to reduce postoperative swelling and bleeding. The nurse assesses the neurovascular status (movement, sensation, color, pulse, capillary refill) of the surgical extremity and compares it with the contralateral extremity every 2 to 4 hours. It is important to encourage active flexion of the foot every hour when the patient is awake. Postoperative efforts are directed at preventing complications (VTE, peroneal nerve palsy, infection, bleeding, limited range of motion).</p>
<p class="indent">Similar to hip surgery, a wound suction drain may be used to remove fluid accumulating in the joint. It is more likely to be used in patients with a body mass index (BMI) over 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2581">Keeney et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). If a drain is used, it is usually left in place for only 24 to 48 hours to reduce the risk of infection (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2581">Keeney et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Antibiotics are given prophylactically and continued for 24 hours postoperatively. The color, type, and amount of drainage are documented, and any excessive drainage or change in characteristics of the drainage is promptly reported to the provider.</p>
<p class="indent">Research findings suggest that continuous passive motion devices (CPMs) have no influence on functional recovery, drainage, pain, or decreasing adverse outcomes in patient&#x2019;s post-TKA. However, they still may be used by some surgeons.</p>
<p class="indent">The physical therapist supervises exercises for strength and range of motion and educates the patient about how to use assistive devices based on weight-bearing restrictions. The goal is eventual flexion around 125 degrees to allow normal motion at the end of rehabilitation. If satisfactory flexion is not achieved, gentle manipulation of the knee joint under general anesthesia may be necessary about 2 weeks after surgery (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2601">Newman, Herschmiller, Attarian, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Patients who are postoperative for TKA should mobilize and ambulate by the first postoperative day (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The patient&#x2019;s weight-bearing status is determined by the surgeon. The knee is usually protected with a knee immobilizer and is elevated when the patient sits in a chair. The typical requirements for discharge to home may include evidence of wound stability (e.g., no erythema, discharge, or redness), appropriate anticoagulation status by laboratory results (i.e., international normalized ratio [INR] between 1.5 and 2), progress toward physical therapy goals (e.g., appropriate use of walker), and satisfactory pain control with oral medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Acute rehabilitation usually takes about 1 to 2 weeks; length of time and discharge destination (e.g., home, acute rehabilitation unit) depend on the age and tolerance of the patient. If discharge is to home, the patient may undergo physical therapy on an outpatient basis. Total recovery takes 6 weeks or longer, especially for those older than 75 years. Late complications that may occur include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;osteolysis:&lt;/b&gt; lysis of bone from inflammatory reaction against polyethylene particulate debris">osteolysis</button></strong> (polyethylene-induced breakdown infection), periprosthetic joint infections, and aseptic loosening of prosthetic components (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2590">Mar, Tan, Song, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">More than 82% of patients who have TKA will still have a functioning prosthesis 25 years after surgery (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2569">Evans, Walker, Evans, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). TKA is a viable option for improving both disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, especially pain and function, leading to positive patient satisfaction. Patients usually can achieve a pain-free, functional joint and participate more fully in life activities than before the surgery (<a href="c36-sec08.xhtml#bib2607">Quinn et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>). The nurse provides ongoing education and psychosocial support throughout the perioperative period to help facilitate these positive outcomes (see <a href="#ct36-5">Chart 36-5</a>).</p>
