<p class="nonindent">The possibility and reality of mass casualties associated with disasters is not new to human history. Historically, communities that anticipated and devised plans to deal with the effects of disasters had better morbidity and mortality rates than those that did not. Within the United States, a plan that adheres to guidelines devised by the National Incident Management System (NIMS), which is directed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is essential for every community and facility. The preparation based on the NIMS guidelines is effective for terrorist events; <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;terrorism:&lt;/b&gt; unlawful, systematic use of violence or threats of violence against people in order to coerce or intimidate">terrorism</button></strong> is the unlawful, systematic use of violence or threats of violence against people in order to coerce or intimidate. NIMS guidelines are also followed for any other disaster situation, including natural disasters, outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. <strong>Natural disasters</strong> are caused by environmental forces including storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and similar forces of nature that result in significant damage or loss of life (<a href="c68-sec07.xhtml#bib4754">Veenema, 2019</a>). Airplane crashes, train crashes, and toxic substance spills are other disasters that can result in mass casualties and tax the resources of health care facilities and their communities.</p>
