<p class="nonindent">Burn recovery generally occurs in three phases: emergent/resuscitative, acute/intermediate, and rehabilitation. Although priorities exist for each of the phases, assessment and management of problems and complications will overlap. <a href="#tt57-3">Table 57-3</a> summarizes the priorities of care for each phase.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s2710">On-the-Scene Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The first step in management is to remove the patient from the source of injury and stop the burning process while preventing injury to the rescuer. Rescue workers&#x2019; priorities include establishing an airway, supplying oxygen (100% oxygen if CO poisoning is suspected), inserting at least one large-bore IV catheter for fluid administration, and covering the wound with a clean, dry cloth or gauze. Continuous irrigation of chemical injury must begin immediately. Chart&#x00A0;57-4 describes the procedures and care required at the burn scene. The outward physical appearance of the person burned is often distracting, but the internal systemic effects pose the greater threat to life.</p>
<p class="indent">An immediate primary survey of the patient is performed assessing the ABCDEs: <em>a</em>irway (A) with consideration given to protecting the cervical spine, gas exchange or <em>b</em>reathing (B), <em>c</em>irculatory and <em>c</em>ardiac status (C), <em>d</em>isability (D) including neurologic deficit, and <em>e</em>xpose and <em>e</em>xamine (E) while maintaining a warm environment (ABA, 2018).</p>

<p class="Box8pTitle"><strong><strong>Emergency Procedures at the Burn Scene</strong></strong></p>
<p class="BoxBL1First"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Extinguish the flames or remove from source.</strong> A fire requires oxygen and fuel once ignited. When clothing catches fire, the flames can be extinguished if the person drops to the floor or ground and rolls (&#x201C;stop, drop, and roll&#x201D;) or uses anything available, such as a blanket, rug, or coat, to smother the flames. The older adult, or others with impaired mobility, could be instructed to &#x201C;stop, sit, and pat&#x201D; to prevent concomitant musculoskeletal injuries. Standing still forces the person to breathe flames and smoke, while running fans the flames. If the burn source is electrical, the electrical source must be disconnected safely before approaching the patient.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Cool the burn.</strong> After the flames are extinguished, the burned area and adherent clothing are soaked with <em>cool</em> water to cool the wound and halt the burning process. However, <em>never</em> apply ice directly to the burn, <em>never</em> wrap the person in ice, and <em>never</em> use cold soaks or dressings for longer than 20 or so minutes; such procedures may worsen tissue damage and lead to hypothermia in people with larger burns.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Remove restrictive objects.</strong> If possible, remove affected, nonadherent clothing immediately. Adherent clothing may be left in place once cooled. Other clothing and all jewelry, including all piercings, should be removed to allow for assessment and to prevent constriction secondary to rapidly developing edema.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Middle"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Cover the wound.</strong> The burn should be covered as quickly as possible to minimize bacterial contamination, maintain body temperature by decreasing evaporative heat loss, and decrease pain by preventing air currents from coming in contact with the exposed nerves in the injured surface. Any clean, dry cloth can be used as an emergency dressing. Ointments and salves should <em>not</em> be used. Other than the dressing, no medication or material should be applied to the burn wound at the scene.</p>
<p class="BoxBL1Last"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span><strong>Irrigate chemical burns.</strong> Chemical burns resulting from contact with a corrosive material are irrigated immediately and continuously with copious amounts of water. Most chemical laboratories have a shower for these types of emergencies. If a chemical contact occurs at home, brush off the chemical agent if dry, remove contaminated and all potentially contaminated clothes immediately, and rinse all areas of the body that have come in contact with the chemical. Rinsing can occur in the shower or any other source of continuous running water. If a chemical gets in or near the eyes, the eyes should be flushed with cool, clean water immediately and copiously. Outcomes for the patient with chemical burns are significantly improved by rapid, sustained flushing of the injury with water at the scene.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Airway patency and breathing must be assessed during the initial minutes of emergency care. Immediate therapy is directed toward establishing a patent airway and giving humidified 100% oxygen. If qualified personnel and equipment are available and the patient with burns has severe respiratory distress and/or airway edema, the rescuers must insert an endotracheal tube and initiate mechanical ventilation. No food or fluid is given by mouth, and the patient is placed in a position that will prevent aspiration of vomitus, because nausea and vomiting may occur, and protection of the airway is always a priority.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">The secondary survey focuses on obtaining a history, the completion of the total body systems assessment, initial fluid resuscitation, and provision of psychosocial support of the conscious patient (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>) (ABA, 2018).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2711">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Long-term outcomes are impacted by the quality of care received in the first few hours after injury (ABA, 2018). Initially, the patient is transported to the nearest emergency department (ED) so that lifesaving measures can be initiated. Early referral to a burn center is then made if indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Initial priorities in the ED remain airway, breathing, and circulation. For mild pulmonary injury, 100% humidified oxygen is given, and the patient is encouraged to cough so that secretions can be expectorated or removed by suctioning. For more severe situations, it may be necessary to remove secretions by bronchial suctioning and administer bronchodilators and mucolytic agents. Continuous monitoring of airway patency is critical; a previously stable airway may rapidly deteriorate as edema increases and toxic effects of smoke inhalation become apparent.</p>
<p class="indent">Once urgent respiratory needs are appropriately addressed, fluid resuscitation is initiated. Fluid resuscitation in patients with burns greater than 20% TBSA addresses the intravascular volume deficit to improve tissue and organ perfusion caused by plasma loss, with the least amount of fluid possible. Daily weights and trends in laboratory test results require close monitoring in the immediate postburn (resuscitation) period to monitor fluid status. Both underresuscitation and overresuscitation with IV fluids are associated with poor outcomes. Shock, ischemic complications, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occur with underresuscitation (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>), and heart failure and pulmonary edema occur with overresuscitation (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In order to facilitate fluid administration, peripheral IV access may be obtained initially; however, in larger burns, central venous access is recommended due to the large volumes required. Once the TBSA is calculated, fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer (LR) should be initiated using ABA resuscitation formulas. LR is the crystalloid of choice because its pH and osmolality most closely resemble human plasma.</p>
<p class="indent">The ABA (2018) fluid resuscitation formula for adults within 24 hours post thermal or chemical burn is as follows:</p>
<p class="center-text">2 mL LR &#x00D7; patient&#x2019;s weight in kilograms &#x00D7; %TBSA second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns</p>
<p class="center-text">For adults with electrical burns:</p>
<p class="center-text">4 mL LR &#x00D7; patient&#x2019;s weight in kilograms &#x00D7; %TBSA second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns</p>
<p class="indent">Timing is one of the most important considerations in calculating fluid needs in the first 24 hours post burn. The starting point is the time of injury&#x2014;not the time of arrival to the treating facility (ABA, 2018). The infusion is regulated so that half of the total calculated volume is given in the first 8 hours postburn injury. The second half of the calculated volume is infused over the next 16 hours.</p>
<p class="indent">These formulas are only guidelines. It is imperative that the rate of infusion be titrated hourly as indicated by physiologic monitoring of the patient&#x2019;s response. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1875" title="1875"></span>Each patient has a unique injury and optimum results require individualized treatments based on patient response (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Gillenwater &#x0026; Garner, 2017</a>). Urinary output continues to be the standard for assessing patient response to fluid resuscitation. A urine output of 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/h in adults indicates appropriate resuscitation in thermal and chemical injuries, whereas in electrical injuries a urine output of 75 to 100 mL/h is desired (ABA, 2018). Other indicators such as blood pressure or heart rate are not useful in assessing adequate intravascular volume in patients with major burns due to the marked inflammatory response.</p>
<p class="indent">After adequate respiratory function and circulatory status have been established, the patient is assessed for cervical spine and/or head injuries if involved in a traumatic or electrical injury. All clothing and jewelry are removed because they may contain chemicals, retain heat, or become constrictive as edema rapidly develops. For chemical burns, flushing of the exposed areas with copious amounts of clean water is continued. The patient is checked for contact lenses. These are removed immediately if chemicals have come in contact with the eyes or if facial burns have occurred. In addition, the eyes are examined promptly for injury to the corneas. An ophthalmologist may be consulted for complete assessment via fluorescent staining to assess for corneal damage.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient&#x2019;s temperature must be monitored because hypothermia may develop rapidly, and manipulation of the environment may be necessary. A temperature less than 35&#x00B0;C (95&#x00B0;F) causes vasoconstriction, which may increase tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to validate an account of the burn scenario provided by the patient, witnesses at the scene, and first responders. Information should include the time and the source of the burn injury, the scene of injury (particularly if the patient was in an enclosed space), length of exposure, prior treatment, and any history of concomitant traumatic injury. A history of preexisting medical conditions, allergies, medications, and the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco is obtained to assist with the treatment plan.</p>
<p class="indent">An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to permit accurate monitoring of urine output and fluid needs and as a measure of kidney function for patients with moderate to severe burns. If the burn exceeds 20% to 25% TBSA, a nasogastric tube is inserted and connected to low intermittent suction. All patients who are intubated should have a nasogastric tube inserted to decompress the stomach, and to prevent vomiting and aspiration. Often, patients with large burns become nauseated as a result of the GI effects of the burn injury, such as paralytic ileus, and the effects of medications such as opioids.</p>
<p class="indent">Clean sheets are placed under and over the patient to protect the burn wound from contamination, maintain body temperature, and reduce pain caused by air currents passing over exposed nerve endings. Baseline height, weight, arterial blood gases, hematocrit, serum electrolytes, blood alcohol level, drug panel, urinalysis, and chest x-rays may be obtained. Because poor tissue perfusion accompanies burn injuries, only IV analgesia is given in small repeated doses, which is crucial for pain reduction in the emergent phase. If the patient has an electrical burn, a baseline electrocardiogram is also obtained and continuous cardiac monitoring is initiated. Because burns are contaminated wounds, tetanus prophylaxis is given if the patient&#x2019;s immunization status is not current or is unknown.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>If necessary, a blood pressure cuff may be placed around a patient&#x2019;s burned extremity. The cuff must be of the correct size with accommodations made for edema.</em></p></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Although the major focus of care during the emergent phase is physiologic stabilization, the nurse must also attend to the patient&#x2019;s and the family&#x2019;s psychological needs. Anxiety accompanies burn injuries and must be addressed on an ongoing basis. A burn injury is a crisis&#x2014;one that causes varying emotional responses that may result in conflicts that may precipitate ethical dilemmas. The patient&#x2019;s and family&#x2019;s coping abilities and available supports are assessed. The nurse must consider special circumstances surrounding the burn injury when providing care. Examples include cases of abuse, neglect, suicide attempts, and injury/death of other family members or friends from the same event.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2712">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing assessment in the emergent phase of burn injury focuses on the major priorities for any trauma patient; the burn wound is a secondary consideration to stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation. The nurse monitors respiratory status closely, and pulses are evaluated, particularly in areas of circumferential burn injury to an extremity. Initially, cardiac monitoring is indicated if the patient has a history of cardiac disease, electrical injury, or altered respiratory conditions. The nurse should monitor vital signs with knowledge of expected abnormalities consistent with burn injury such as tachycardia, tachypnea.</p>
<p class="indent">If all extremities are burned, determining blood pressure may be difficult. A clean dressing applied under the blood pressure cuff protects the wound from contamination. Because increasing edema makes blood pressure difficult to auscultate, a Doppler (ultrasound) device or a noninvasive electronic blood pressure device may be helpful. In patients with severe burns, an arterial catheter is preferred for blood pressure measurement and is helpful for collecting blood specimens. Peripheral pulses in burned extremities are checked frequently either by palpation or the use of a Doppler. Elevation of burned extremities above the level of the heart is indicated for edema reduction. Large-bore IV catheters (e.g., 16 to 18 gauge) and an indwelling urinary catheter are inserted, if not already in situ, and the nurse&#x2019;s documentation must include hourly assessment of fluid intake and urine output.</p>
<p class="indent">Red-colored urine suggests the presence of hemochromogens from damage to red blood cells and myoglobin, the by-product of muscle damage (ABA, 2018). This anomaly is associated with deep burns caused by electrical injury or prolonged contact with heat or flame. Glycosuria, a common finding in the early postburn hours, results from the release of liver glycogen stores in response to stress.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse assists with calculating the patient&#x2019;s expected fluid requirements and monitoring the patient&#x2019;s response to fluid resuscitation. Nurse-driven resuscitation protocols have been shown to decrease the amount of fluid given and improve patient outcomes in the emergent/resuscitative phase (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4140">Stewart, Ladd, Kovler, et al., 2019</a>). Nursing responsibilities consist of appropriate fluid administration, strict monitoring <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1876" title="1876"></span>of intake and output, monitoring the patient&#x2019;s response, and notifying the treatment team of significant assessment findings and any abnormal laboratory values.</p>
<p class="indent">To help guide treatment, the following are essential: documentation of body temperature, body weight, and pre-burn weight; history of allergies, tetanus immunization, past medical and surgical history, and current illnesses; and a list of current medications. The nurse performs a head-to-toe assessment, focusing on signs and symptoms of concomitant illness, associated trauma, or developing complications. Assessing the extent of the burn wound using the rule of nines or facilitated with anatomic diagrams (described previously) is performed. Additionally, the nurse works with the primary provider to clinically assess and document the initial areas of full- and partial-thickness injury. Psychosocial considerations of the patient and family and communication with the treatment team are imperative early in the course of care.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care of the patient in the emergent/resuscitative phase of burn injury is detailed in <a href="#ct57-5">Chart 57-5</a>.</p>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m11"><img class="m" src="images/icon17a.png" alt=""/> Acute/Intermediate Phase</p>
<p class="nonindent">The acute/intermediate phase of burn care follows the emergent/resuscitative phase and begins 48 to 72 hours after the burn injury. During this phase, attention is directed toward continued assessment and maintenance of respiratory and circulatory status, fluid and electrolyte balance, and GI and kidney function. Infection prevention and control, burn wound care (e.g., wound cleaning and d&#x00E9;bridement, topical antibacterial/antimicrobial therapy, application of dressings, wound grafting), pain management, modulation of the hypermetabolic response, and early positioning/mobility are priorities in the acute/intermediate stage of recovery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2713">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pulmonary complications are common in burn injury. Airway obstruction caused by upper airway edema can take as long as 48 hours to develop. Changes detected by x-ray and arterial blood gas analysis may occur as the effects of resuscitative fluid and the chemical reactions of smoke ingredients with lung tissues become evident. Diagnosis is largely based on history and clinical presentation, monitoring of arterial blood gases with carboxyhemoglobin levels, and direct observation of the airway by fiberoptic bronchoscopy (ABA, 2018). To lessen the effects of upper airway edema, elevation of the patient&#x2019;s head of the bed may be helpful. Stridor and dyspnea are ominous because they are late signs of impending airway obstruction. Early protective intubation to maintain airway patency should be considered as obstruction may occur very rapidly. However, intubation and mechanical ventilation are significant contributors to pulmonary infections. Ideally, the best practice is to remove the endotracheal tube as soon as possible so that a route for pathogens is not accessible to the lungs (ABA, 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">Late pulmonary complications secondary to inhalation injuries include mucosal sloughing of the airway and cast formation from cellular debris, which can lead to obstruction, increased secretions, inflammation, atelectasis, airway ulceration, pulmonary edema, and tissue hypoxia. Although research results are mixed, nebulized heparin therapy may be administered because it is thought to have some effect on the inflammatory cascade and formation of fibrin casts in the airways (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Suresh &#x0026; Dries, 2018</a>). Pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may also occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of any patient who is hospitalized and mechanically ventilated and is particularly exacerbated in the patient with an inhalation injury. It affects as many as 10% to 20% of patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 48 hours. See <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <a href="c19-sec04.xhtml#ct19-6">Chart 19-6</a>, for discussion of &#x201C;bundled&#x201D; strategies to prevent VAP and <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for discussion of respiratory failure and ARDS.</p>
<p class="indent">As capillaries regain their integrity, 48 or more hours after the burn, fluid shifts from the interstitial to the intravascular compartment and intrinsic diuresis begins. If cardiac or kidney function is inadequate, fluid overload may occur, and symptoms of heart failure may emerge (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>). Administration of fluids and electrolytes continues cautiously during this phase of burn care due to fluid shifts, evaporative fluid loss from large burn wounds, and the patient&#x2019;s physiologic responses to the burn injury. Blood components are given as needed to treat surgical blood loss and anemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Hyperthermia is common in patients after burn shock resolves. A resetting of the core body temperature in patients who are severely burned results in a body temperature a few degrees higher than normal for several weeks after the burn. This can be compounded by body temperature increases from sepsis.</p>
<p class="indent">Central venous, arterial, or specialty catheters (e.g., hemodialysis catheters, Zoll<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> catheters) may be required for monitoring hemodynamics. Commonly, patients with major burns need multiple invasive line sites due to the amount and frequency of fluid and medications required. Whenever possible, burned areas of the body are avoided as insertion sites for invasive lines.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the most important medical interventions for patients with burns that have positively affected mortality is early <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;excision:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of tissue">excision</button></strong> (surgical removal of tissue). The presence of the open wounds or invasive organisms triggers the response to a large burn injury, a systemic cascade of events (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4108">Culnan, Sherman, Chung, et al., 2018</a>). Excising the necrotic tissue can ameliorate this response and preserve underlying viable tissue.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infection Prevention and Control</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are multifactorial reasons why patients with burns incur some of the highest risks for health care&#x2013;associated infections (HAIs). The systemic response to a burn injury results in dysregulation of the immune system, predisposing the patient to invasion by environmental pathogens (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4129">Lachiewicz, Hauck, Weber, et al., 2017</a>). The wound provides a perfect medium for bacterial proliferation, as well as a conduit to the bloodstream (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4135">Ramos, Cornistein, Cerino, et al., 2017</a>). Because of the loss of the epidermal barrier, presence of transmittable bacteria, and the ubiquity of mold species in the environment, it is critical that the nurse prioritizes infection prevention in the plan of care (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4139">Sood, Vaidya, Dam, et al., 2018</a>). In addition, to support vital organs and bodily functions, invasive procedures are required which may undermine the body&#x2019;s natural defenses (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Ramos et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p class="indent1">Causative agents of burn infections include bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Hydrotherapy equipment, direct or indirect contamination from healthcare workers&#x2019; hands, environmental surfaces, and translocation of microorganisms from other body systems&#x2014;most notably, the GI tract&#x2014;are all common sources of potential contamination in the burn unit that require hypervigilance. Whether the burn wound is healing through spontaneous reepithelialization or is being prepared for skin grafting, protection from pathogens is crucial. Infection impedes burn wound healing by promoting excessive inflammation and damaging tissue. Clinical signs of infection include progressive erythema, warmth, tenderness, and malodorous exudate.</p>
<p class="indent">A multiple-strategy approach is crucial in prevention and control of burn wound infections. Such strategies include:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>The use of barrier techniques (e.g., gowns, gloves, eye protection, and masks if needed)</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1880" title="1880"></span>Environmental cleaning with periodic cultures of patient care equipment (with special attention to hydrotherapy equipment)</li>
<li>Application of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents</li>
<li>Appropriate use of systemic antibiotic and antifungal agents (careful use and close monitoring of culture sensitivities are needed due to increasing challenges of antibiotic resistance in healthcare environments)</li>
<li>Early excision and closure of the burn wound</li>
<li>Control of hyperglycemia (with insulin as indicated, even in a patient without a prior diagnosis of diabetes)</li>
<li>Management of the hypermetabolic response (see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">There are varying practices in the burn community regarding obtaining cultures for surveillance. In some burn centers, patients may be cultured on admission to screen for the presence of regionally known pathogens. Wounds are generally cultured on admission, prior to cleaning, with each surgical case, and for clinical suspicion of infection. Antimicrobial therapy is tailored to culture results. The broad use of prophylactic antibiotics is not supported by current research (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Ramos et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Wound Cleaning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Proper management of burn wounds prevents wound deterioration. The goal of wound care is removal of nonviable tissue and wound exudate, and elimination of previously applied topical agents. Gentle cleaning with mild soap, water, and a washcloth can prevent infection by decreasing the bacteria and debris on the wound surface. Hair in and around the burn area, except the eyebrows, should be clipped short or shaved.</p>
<p class="indent">Various processes may facilitate cleaning burn wounds. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable may have their wounds washed at the bedside, whereas patients who are ambulatory may shower themselves or with assistance. Patients who are nonambulatory can be bathed and receive wound care using shower carts&#x2014;mobile stretchers made with removable sides, drainage holes, and positioning capabilities. Retractable water hoses suspended from walls and ceilings provide the nurse with easy access to a clean water source for washing the wounds. Whatever method employed, the goal is to protect the wound from acute proliferation of pathogenic organisms on the surface through mechanical washing to prevent invasion of deeper tissues until the wounds are closed through spontaneous healing or skin grafting. Strategies for the prevention of cross-contamination include the use of plastic liners on the shower carts and chairs, water filtration systems or point-of-care filters, and thorough decontamination of equipment after each use.</p>
<p class="indent">Patient comfort and ability to participate in the prescribed treatment are important considerations. During bathing, patient participation is encouraged to promote exercise and range of motion of the extremities. During wound cleaning, the nurse inspects all skin for any signs of redness, breakdown, or local infection. This also provides the nurse an opportunity for targeted patient education.</p>
<p class="indent">During treatment, the patient is continuously assessed for signs of hypothermia. The temperature of the water is maintained at 37.8&#x00B0;C (100&#x00B0;F), and the temperature of the room should be maintained between 26.6&#x00B0; and 29.4&#x00B0;C (80&#x00B0; and 85&#x00B0;F) to prevent hypothermia. Other assessment considerations include patient fatigue, changes in hemodynamic status, and pain unrelieved by analgesic medications or relaxation techniques.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Topical Antibacterial Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Variations in topical wound care for nonsurgical burn wounds exist among burn centers across the country. Selections are based on the individualized needs of each patient. The goal of topical therapy is to provide a dressing with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Effective against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and fungi</li>
<li>Penetrates the eschar but is not systemically toxic</li>
<li>Is cost-effective, available, and acceptable to the patient</li>
<li>Is easy to apply and remove, decreases the frequency of dressing changes, decreases pain, and minimizes nursing time</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">No single topical medication is universally effective, and the use of different agents at different times in the postburn period is best practice.</p>

<p class="clinicaltext"><em>Prudent use and alternation of antimicrobial agents can result in reduction of resistant strains of bacteria, greater effectiveness of the agents, and a decreased risk of sepsis. <a href="#tt57-4">Table 57-4</a> describes select topical antimicrobial agents.</em></p></div>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Wound Dressing</h6>
<p class="nonindent">After the prescribed topical agents are applied, the wound is covered with several layers of dry dressings with lighter dressing over joints to allow for mobility. Dressings may also require modification to accommodate splints or other positioning devices. Circumferential dressings should always be applied distally to proximally to promote return of excess fluid into the central circulation. In the case of hand or foot burns, the fingers and toes should be wrapped individually to promote mobility and function while healing.</p>
<p class="indent">Burns to the face may be left open to air once cleaned and the topical agent has been applied to maintain a moist environment. Careful attention ensures the topical agent does not come in contact with the eyes or mouth. A light, nonrestrictive dressing may be applied to the face to absorb excess exudate if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Occlusive dressings, bulky gauze, and a topical antimicrobial agent may be used over areas with new skin grafts to protect the new graft and promote an optimal condition for its adherence to the recipient site. Ideally, these surgical dressings remain in place for 3 to 5 days, to allow growth of the microcirculation into the new graft before removal for inspection of the graft. When occlusive dressings are applied, precautions are taken to prevent two body surfaces from touching one another, such as fingers or toes, ear and scalp, the areas under the breasts, any point of flexion, or between the genital folds. Functional body alignment positions are maintained by using splints or by regular repositioning of the patient.</p>

<p class="indent">Dressings that adhere to the wound bed may be removed more comfortably and with less damage to healing tissue by moistening the dressing with water or saline. The patient may participate in removing the dressings, providing some degree of control over this painful procedure. The wounds are then cleaned and d&#x00E9;brided to remove any remaining topical agent, exudate, and nonviable tissue. Sterile scissors and forceps may be used to trim loose eschar and encourage separation of devitalized tissue. During this procedure, the wound and surrounding skin are carefully inspected. Documentation should include color, odor, size, exudate, signs of reepithelialization, any changes from the previous dressing change, and other key characteristics.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Wound D&#x00E9;bridement</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;d&#x00E9;bridement:&lt;/b&gt; surgical removal of contaminated and devitalized tissues and foreign material">d&#x00E9;bridement</button></strong> (removal of <em>devitalized</em> tissue) are:</p>
<ul class="bull56"><li>Removal of devitalized tissue or burn eschar in preparation for grafting and wound healing</li>
<li>Removal of tissue contaminated by bacteria and foreign bodies, thereby protecting the patient from invasion of bacteria</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">There are four types of d&#x00E9;bridement&#x2014;natural, mechanical, chemical, and surgical.</p>
<p class="h7">Natural D&#x00E9;bridement</p>
<p class="nonindent">With natural d&#x00E9;bridement, the devitalized tissue separates from the underlying viable tissue spontaneously. Bacteria present at the interface of the burned tissue and healthy viable tissue gradually liquefy the fibrils of <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;collagen:&lt;/b&gt; a protein present in skin, tendon, bone, cartilage, and connective tissue">collagen</button></strong>, a protein present in skin, tendon, bone, cartilage, and connective tissue, that hold the eschar in place. Proteolytic and other natural enzymes cause this phenomenon. The process may take weeks to months to occur.</p>
<p class="h7">Mechanical D&#x00E9;bridement</p>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical d&#x00E9;bridement involves the use of surgical tools to separate and remove the eschar. This technique, performed by primary providers, specially trained nurses, or physical therapists, is usually performed with routine dressing changes. If bleeding occurs, hemostatic agents or pressure may be applied to achieve hemostasis. Dressing changes and wound cleaning aid the removal of wound debris. Wet-to-dry dressings are not advised for burn care because of the possibility of removing viable epithelial cells along with necrotic tissue. Wet-to-wet or wet-to-moist dressings may be used instead.</p>
<p class="h7">Chemical D&#x00E9;bridement</p>
<p class="nonindent">Topical enzymatic agents are available to promote d&#x00E9;bridement of burn wounds. Because such agents usually do not have antimicrobial properties, they may be combined with topical antibacterial therapy to protect the patient from bacterial invasion. Heavy metals such as silver can deactivate d&#x00E9;briding agents; therefore, caution is necessary to ensure that the topical antimicrobial agent does not interfere with the chemical d&#x00E9;bridement. Alternating topical medications may also be effective in achieving d&#x00E9;bridement without infection.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1881</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1882" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1882">p. 1882</span></div>
<p class="h7">Surgical D&#x00E9;bridement</p>
<p class="nonindent">Early surgical excision to remove devitalized tissue along with early burn wound closure has long been recognized as one of the most important factors contributing to survival in a patient with a major burn injury. Surgical d&#x00E9;bridement occurs before the natural separation of eschar transpires from bacterial lysis of collagen fibers at the dermal&#x2013;eschar junction. This may be performed as soon as possible after the burn, once the patient is hemodynamically stable and edema has decreased. Ideally, the wound is covered immediately with a skin graft (if necessary) and a dressing. If the wound bed is not ready for a skin graft at the time of excision, a temporary biologic or synthetic dressing may be applied until an autograft can be successfully applied during a subsequent surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of surgical excision carries with it risks and complications, especially with large burns. The procedure creates a high risk of extensive blood loss with lengthy operating and anesthesia times. Blood losses sustained during surgical procedures, wound care, and ongoing hemolysis exacerbate anemia. Blood transfusions may be required periodically to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels for oxygen delivery to the myocardium. See <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a> for discussion of blood component therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">When conducted in a timely and efficient manner, surgical excision results in shorter lengths of stay and decreased risk of complications from invasive burn wound sepsis. Once d&#x00E9;brided, granulation tissue fills the void created by the wound, creates a barrier to bacteria, and serves as a bed for epithelial cell growth. A wound covering is applied to keep the wound bed moist and promote the granulation process.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Wound Grafting</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with deep partial- or full-thickness burns may be a candidate for skin grafting to decrease the risk of infection; prevent further loss of protein, fluid, and electrolytes through the wound; minimize evaporative heat loss; and reduce scarring. Special attention is warranted when grafting the face (for cosmetic, functional, and psychological reasons); functional areas, such as the hands and feet; and areas over joints. Grafting permits earlier function and reduces scar <strong>contractures</strong> (shrinkage of burn scar through collagen maturation). When burns are very extensive, the order in which areas are grafted is chosen based on the ability to achieve wound closure as soon as possible; therefore, the chest and abdomen or back may be grafted first to reduce the overall open wound size.</p>
<p class="h7">Autografts</p>
<p class="nonindent">Autografting remains the preferred autologous method for definitive burn wound closure after excision. <strong>Autografts</strong> are the ideal means of covering burn wounds because the grafts are the patient&#x2019;s own skin and therefore are not rejected by the patient&#x2019;s immune system. They can be split-thickness, full-thickness, or epithelial grafts. Because the <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;donor site:&lt;/b&gt; the area from which skin is taken to provide a skin graft for another part of the body">donor site</button></strong> (the area from which skin is taken to provide the autograft) for a full-thickness graft includes both the epidermis and dermis, its use must be cautiously considered because the donor site cannot heal spontaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">Split-thickness autografts are most commonly used and can be applied in sheets (see <a href="#ff57-7">Fig. 57-7</a>), or they can be expanded by meshing so that they cover more than a given donor site area (see <a href="#ff57-8">Fig. 57-8</a>). Skin meshers enable the surgeon to cut tiny slits into a sheet of donor skin, making it possible to expand, covering larger areas with smaller amounts of donor skin. Expanded grafts adhere to the recipient site more easily than sheet grafts and prevent the accumulation of blood, serum, air, or purulent material under the graft that would prevent revascularization and adherence. However, any kind of graft other than a sheet graft contributes to scar formation as it heals. The use of widely meshed (largely expanded) grafts may be necessary in large wounds but should be viewed as a compromise in terms of cosmesis.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff57-7">
<figure class="figure">
<img src="images/ff57-7.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="caption"><a class="vsm-modal-img-widget" href="images/l-ff57-7.jpg"><img style="float:right;" src="images/enlarge.png" alt=""/></a><p><span class="fig-label">Figure&#x00A0;57-7 &#x2022;</span> Split-thickness sheet graft. Used with permission from University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">If blood, serum, air, fat, or necrotic tissue is present between the recipient site and the graft, there may be partial or total loss of the graft. Infection, mishandling of the graft, sheer injury with mobilization or trauma during dressing changes account for most other instances of graft loss. The use of split-thickness grafts allows the remaining donor site to retain sweat glands and hair follicles, minimizing healing time.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultured epithelial autograft (CEA) has emerged as an important procedure in the management of massive burns. In burns that cover more than 90% TBSA, CEA may be the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1883" title="1883"></span>only option because the availability of nonburned skin as donor sites will not be sufficient for grafting. CEA involves obtaining full-thickness biopsies of the patient&#x2019;s unburned skin that are cultured to promote growth of keratinocytes. The final product is available approximately 3 weeks later for grafting (see <a href="#ff57-9">Fig. 57-9</a>). Meticulous attention is required to apply CEA to body surfaces because it is extremely fragile and prone to graft loss. Use of CEA can be cost prohibitive; besides its direct costs, it also requires inordinately extended LOS for the patient.</p>

<p class="h8">Care of the graft site</p>
<p class="nonindent">Protection and immobility are key in caring for skin grafts postoperatively. Occlusive dressings encased in bulky gauze wraps are commonly used initially after grafting to immobilize the graft and support the humid environment required for optimal healing. Occupational or physical therapists may construct splints to immobilize joints affecting newly grafted areas. Homograft, xenograft, or synthetic dressings (discussed later) may also be used to protect fragile grafts or widely expanded meshed grafts.</p>
<p class="indent">The first dressing change is usually performed 3 to 5 days after surgery, or earlier if clinical signs of infection or bleeding are present. Infection, bleeding beneath the graft, and shearing forces are the most common reasons for graft loss in the early postoperative period. Patients must be positioned and turned carefully to avoid disturbing the graft or applying pressure on the graft site. If an extremity has been grafted, it is elevated to reduce edema. The patient may begin actively exercising the grafted area 5 to 7 days after surgery. This may vary with individual burn center&#x2019;s protocols.</p>
<p class="h8">Care of the donor site</p>
<p class="nonindent">The donor site is a clean, usually superficial wound created in a surgical environment that the surgeon uses to obtain a piece of skin for grafting of the wound bed. After the skin is excised, a hemostatic agent such as thrombin or epinephrine may be applied directly to the donor site to promote hemostasis. A myriad of dressings are available to cover donor sites once hemostasis is obtained. Because a donor site is usually a partial-thickness wound, it is very painful, an additional potential site of infection, and very susceptible to pressure injury. With proper care, the donor site should heal spontaneously within 7 to 14 days in an adult who was previously healthy and nonsmoking (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4123">Foster, Richey, Osborn, et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Homografts and Xenografts</p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Homografts</strong> (or allografts) and <strong>xenografts</strong> (or heterografts) are also referred to as biologic dressings and are intended as temporary wound coverage. Homografts are pieces of skin obtained from recently deceased or living humans other than the patient. Xenografts consist of skin taken from animals (usually pigs). Therefore, the body&#x2019;s immune response will eventually reject either of them as a foreign substance.</p>
<p class="indent">In extensive burns, biologic dressings provide temporary wound coverage and protection of granulation tissue until autografting is possible. As a temporary dressing, they also decrease the wound&#x2019;s evaporative water and protein loss, provide an effective barrier against entry of bacteria, and decrease pain by protecting nerve endings. Biologic dressings can be left open to air or covered with a dressing. They stay in place for varying lengths of time, but are removed in instances of bacterial colonization, infection, or rejection of the dressing by the body. They may also be used as a test graft in preparation for autografting to determine if the wound bed will accept the graft. Once the biologic dressing appears to be &#x201C;taking,&#x201D; or adhering to the granulating surface with minimal underlying exudation, the patient is ready for an autologous skin graft. Another advantage of biologic dressings is that fewer dressing changes may be required.</p>
<p class="indent">Homografts tend to be the most expensive biologic dressings. They are available from skin banks in fresh and cryopreserved (frozen) forms. Homografts are thought to provide the best infection control of all biologic or biosynthetic dressings available. Revascularization occurs within 48 hours, and the graft may be left in place for several weeks.</p>
<p class="indent">Pigskin, an effective xenograft, is available from commercial suppliers. It is available fresh, frozen, or lyophilized (freeze-dried) for longer shelf life. Pigskin is used for temporary covering of clean wounds such as superficial partial-thickness wounds and donor sites. Although pigskin does not vascularize, it adheres to clean superficial wounds, providing pain control and reducing evaporative fluid loss allowing the underlying wound to reepithelialize (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4105">Aly, Dannoun, Jimenez, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When grafting is not possible, surgically applied skin substitutes have been created that replace the epidermis or the dermis either temporarily or permanently. Each provides advantages and disadvantages that are important to consider in product selection.</p>
<p class="h7">Biosynthetic and Synthetic Dressings</p>
<p class="nonindent">Problems with availability, sterility, and cost have prompted the search for biosynthetic and synthetic dressings, which may eventually replace biologic dressings as temporary wound coverings. There are currently many products on the market, but they tend to be cost prohibitive for most patients and in most healthcare settings.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pain Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A burn injury is considered one of the most painful types of trauma that a person can experience. The nature of the injury may expose nerve endings to the atmosphere; and the patient may require multiple procedures, d&#x00E9;bridements, surgeries, and treatments. Moving, changing position, and receiving occupational and physical therapy cause additional discomfort. Adequate pain management must address background, breakthrough, and procedural pain.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1883</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1884" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1884">p. 1884</span></div>
<p class="indent">Background pain is a continuous level of discomfort experienced even when the patient is inactive or not undergoing any procedures. The goal of treatment is to provide a long-acting analgesic agent that will provide uniform coverage for this long-term discomfort. It is helpful to use small escalating doses when initiating analgesia to reach the level of pain control that is acceptable to the patient and facilitates their participation in recovery. The use of patient-controlled analgesia gives control to the patient and often achieves this goal.</p>
<p class="indent">Breakthrough pain is described as acute, intense, and episodic. It is generally related to an activity or movement of the affected area. Short-acting agents are used for breakthrough pain to achieve pain control if needed. Procedural pain is discomfort that occurs with procedures such as daily wound treatments, invasive line insertions, and physical and occupational therapy. The goal is to plan proper analgesia to facilitate comfort for the patient throughout the procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Most severe burns are a combination of partial- and full-thickness burns that influence the amount of pain the patient experiences. Superficial and partial-thickness burns are very painful because the nerve endings are not protected, resulting in excruciating pain with exposure to temperature, pressure, air currents, and movement. In a full-thickness burn, the nerve endings are destroyed, and there is numbness and decreased sensation to that area. Thus, the patient often underestimates severe injuries. Memories of the pain patients experience may persist for a long time. Educating patients and their families about burn pain and its relationship to the depth of injury as well as the pain management plan is an important priority for the nurse.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacologic treatment for the management of burn pain includes the use of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, and anesthetic agents. These and other pain management strategies are discussed in <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. For treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines may be used in conjunction with opioids. The use of anesthetics in a nonoperative setting (i.e., moderate sedation) requires administration and monitoring by qualified personnel. Recent advances include the use of agents with rapid onset and short duration, which have been very effective in pain control during a planned procedure. In the provision of holistic patient care, the use of nonpharmacologic pain and anxiety interventions must not be overlooked. Nonpharmacologic therapies include relaxation techniques, distraction, guided imagery, hypnosis, therapeutic touch, humor, music therapy, and virtual reality techniques.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Modulation of Hypermetabolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Burn injuries produce profound metabolic abnormalities fueled by the exaggerated stress response to the injury. The body&#x2019;s response has been classified as hyperdynamic, hypermetabolic, and hypercatabolic. Hypermetabolism can affect morbidity and mortality by increasing the risk of infection and slowing the healing rate.</p>
<p class="indent">Nutrition should be provided as soon as possible upon arrival to the burn center and may require placement of a nasogastric tube for adequate calorie delivery. Patients who are critically ill may even have their feedings continued intraoperatively if the airway is protected. Several formulas exist for estimating the daily metabolic expenditure and caloric requirements of patients with burn injuries. Carbohydrates are the most important energy source for patients who are severely burned (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Culnan et al., 2018</a>). Fat, although a required nutrient, should be provided in more limited quantities. When the oral route is used, high-protein, high-calorie meals and supplements are given. Dietary consultations are useful in helping patients meet their nutritional needs. Daily calorie counts aid in assessing the adequacy of nutritional intake.</p>
<p class="indent">Early excision and grafting of the burn wound is one of the most important factors in ameliorating hypermetabolism by removing eschar, thereby lessening the effects of inflammatory mediators. Appropriate manipulation of environmental temperatures decreases energy expenditure by the patient (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4137">Rizzo, Rowan, Driscoll, et al., 2017</a>). Insulin therapy in patients with burns is required to treat the hyperglycemia that occurs from accelerated gluconeogenesis and is beneficial in muscle protein synthesis. Oxandrolone, an anabolic steroid, is commonly given to patients with burns because it improves protein synthesis and metabolism. Administration of propranolol (a beta-blocker) decreases heart rate and blocks harmful catecholamine effects.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2714">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing management of the patient in the acute/intermediate phase is focused on the following priorities: restoring fluid balance, preventing infection, modulating hypermetabolism, promoting skin integrity, relieving pain and discomfort, promoting mobility, strengthening coping strategies, supporting patient and family processes, and monitoring and managing complications.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Restoring Normal Fluid Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To reduce the risk of fluid overload and consequent heart failure and pulmonary edema, daily weights and careful calculation of intake and output measurement are utilized to guide therapy. Thirst, a normal body response to hypovolemia, may cause the patient to drink excessive amounts of water, driving the serum sodium to dangerously low levels. Serum sodium levels should be trended as fluid shifts may lead to metabolic derangements. Changes in physical assessment and hemodynamic indicators are also useful in evaluating the patient&#x2019;s response to treatment.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Preventing Infection</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with burns is at risk for infection from multiple sources, which may include open wounds, lung injury, GI ischemia, and indwelling catheters. Increased temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis are inherently present in the patient with burns, masking clinical signs of infection. Therapeutic interventions are complex due to the patient&#x2019;s altered physiology.</p>
<p class="indent">A major part of the nurse&#x2019;s role during the acute phase of burn care is detection and prevention of infection. The nurse is responsible for providing a clean environment, including the promotion of protective isolation interventions. The nurse protects the patient from sources of contamination, including other patients, staff members, visitors, and equipment. Patients can inadvertently promote migration of microorganisms from one burned area to another by touching their wounds or dressings. Bed linens can also spread infection through either colonization with wound microorganisms <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1885" title="1885"></span>or fecal contamination. Regular bathing of unburned areas and changing of linens can help prevent infection. Fresh flowers, plants, and fresh fruit baskets are not permitted in the patient&#x2019;s room because of the risk of microorganism growth. Changing invasive lines and tubing routinely in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and institutional policy, and then promptly removing them when no longer indicated, will prevent many HAIs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Modulating Hypermetabolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse collaborates with the dietitian or nutrition support team to develop a plan that meets the needs of the patient. Family members may be encouraged to bring nutritious and favorite foods to the hospital. High-calorie nutritional supplements may be necessary. Nutritional intake must be accurately documented. Vitamin and mineral supplements may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent">If caloric goals cannot be met by oral feeding, a feeding tube is inserted and used for continuous or bolus feedings of specific formulas. The volume of residual gastric secretions should be checked periodically to ensure absorption. The patient should be weighed each day and the results tracked to properly assess appropriate weight parameters and to attenuate catabolism of lean muscle mass.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Skin Integrity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Wound care is usually the single most time-consuming element of burn care after the emergent phase. The primary provider prescribes the desired topical antibacterial agents and specific biologic, biosynthetic, or synthetic wound coverings and plans for surgical excision and grafting. The nurse needs to make astute assessments of wound status, use creative approaches to dressing of wounds, and support the patient during the emotionally distressing and significantly painful experience of wound care.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of the burn wound requires an experienced eye, hand, and sense of smell. Important wound assessment features include size, color, odor, presence of eschar and exudate, epithelial buds (small pearl-like clusters of cells on the wound surface), bleeding, granulation tissue, the status of graft take, healing of the donor site, and the condition of the surrounding skin. Any significant changes in the wound are reported to the primary provider because they may indicate burn wound infection and require immediate intervention.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse also assists the patient and family by providing education, support, and encouragement to take an active part in dressing changes and wound care when appropriate. Discharge planning needs for wound care must be anticipated early in the course of burn management, and the strengths of the patient and family are assessed and used in preparing for the patient&#x2019;s eventual discharge and home care needs. Family presence during dressing changes promotes feelings of readiness for discharge.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Pain and Discomfort</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pain management continues to be a priority during the acute phase of burn recovery. Frequent assessment of pain is required, and analgesic and anxiolytic medications are administered as prescribed. To increase its effectiveness, analgesic medication is provided before the pain becomes severe. Nonpharmacologic interventions can be used to alter the patient&#x2019;s perceptions of and responses to pain. Frequent reassessment of responses to interventions, whether pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic, is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">Postburn pruritus (itching) affects almost all patients with burns and is one of the most distressing symptoms in the postburn period. Oral antipruritic agents, environmental conditions, frequent lubrication of the skin with water or silica-based lotion, and diversion activities all help to promote comfort in this phase. The instructions &#x201C;pat, don&#x2019;t scratch&#x201D; must be reinforced with patients in order to prevent further discomfort and infectious complications</p>
<p class="indent">Lack of sleep and rest interfere with healing, comfort, and restoration of energy. If necessary, sleep aids may be prescribed on a regular basis in addition to analgesic and anxiolytic agents.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Physical Mobility</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An early priority is prevention of the complications of immobility. Deep breathing, turning, and proper positioning are essential nursing practices that prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, control edema, and prevent pressure injuries and contractures. Specialty beds may be useful, and early mobility is strongly encouraged. If the lower extremities are burned, elastic pressure bandages should be applied before the patient is placed in an upright position to promote venous return and minimize edema formation.</p>
<p class="indent">The burn wound is in a dynamic state for at least 1 year after wound closure. During this time, aggressive efforts must be made to prevent contracture and hypertrophic scarring. Both passive and active range-of-motion exercises are initiated from the day of admission and are continued after grafting within prescribed limitations. Splints or functional devices applied to the extremities may lessen contractures through compression and stretch. The nurse monitors the splinted areas for signs of vascular insufficiency, nerve compression, and skin breakdown. Occupational and physical therapists are consulted to develop a patient-specific plan of care throughout hospitalization and recovery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Strengthening Coping Strategies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Much of the patient&#x2019;s energy goes into maintaining vital physical functions and wound healing in the early postburn weeks, leaving little emotional energy for coping. In the acute phase of burn care, the patient is facing the reality of the burn injury. Grief, depression, anger, regression, and manipulative behavior are common responses of patients who have burn injuries. Withdrawal from participation in required treatments and regression must be viewed with an understanding that such behavior may help the patient cope with an enormously stressful event.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient may experience feelings of anger. At times, the anger may be directed inward because of a sense of guilt, perhaps for causing the fire or even for surviving when others perished. The anger may also be directed outward toward those who escaped unharmed or those who are now providing care. One way to help the patient handle these emotions is to enlist someone to whom the patient can express feelings without fear of retaliation. A nurse, social worker, psychiatric liaison nurse, peer supporter, spiritual advisor, or counselor who is not involved in direct care activities may fill this role successfully.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1885</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1886" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1886">p. 1886</span></div>
<p class="indent">Patients with burn injuries are very dependent on healthcare team members during the long period of treatment and recovery. However, even when physically unable to contribute much to self-care, they should be included in decisions regarding care and encouraged to assert their individuality in terms of preferences and recognition of their unique identities. As the patient improves in mobility and strength, the nurse works with the patient to set realistic expectations for self-care and planning for the future. Many patients respond positively to the use of contractual agreements and other strategies that recognize their independence, set expectations for behavior, and encourage positive communication.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Supporting Patient and Family Processes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The life-altering burn injury has tremendous psychological, economic, and social impact on the patient and family. The nurse is instrumental in providing support to the patient and family as they adapt to the burn injury. Referrals for social services or psychological counseling should be made as appropriate. This support continues into the rehabilitation phase. Some burn centers offer structured support programs which provide evidenced-based communication training to patients who have survived a burn injury with the goal of helping them to become more effective peer supporters. The peer supporter will visit the hospitalized patient to provide psychosocial support. Many patients appreciate the opportunity to be able to share their experience with another person who has had a burn injury.</p>
<p class="indent">With only 70 verified burn centers in the United States (ABA, 2019), patients who experience major burns are commonly sent to burn centers far from home. Because burn injuries are sudden and unexpected, family roles are disrupted. If the primary caregiver or wage earner in the family is injured, roles may change, which adds more stress to the family. Therefore, both the patient and the family need thorough information regarding the patient&#x2019;s burn care and expected course of treatment. Barriers to learning and preferred learning styles are assessed and considered. This information is used to tailor education activities. Patient and family education is a priority and is best provided with a multimedia approach.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications</h6>
<p class="h7">Acute Respiratory Failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient&#x2019;s respiratory status is monitored closely for increased difficulty in breathing, change in respiratory pattern, or onset of adventitious (abnormal) breath sounds. Typically, at this stage, signs and symptoms of injury to the respiratory tract become apparent. As described previously, signs of hypoxia, diminished breath sounds, wheezing, tachypnea, stridor, and sputum tinged with soot (or in some cases containing sloughed tracheal tissue) are among the many possible findings. Medical management of the patient with acute respiratory failure requires intubation and mechanical ventilation (if not already in use). If ARDS has developed, higher oxygen levels, positive end-expiratory pressure, and pressure support are used with mechanical ventilation to promote gas exchange across the alveolar&#x2013;capillary membrane (see <a href="c19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema</p>
<p class="nonindent">If the cardiac and renal systems cannot compensate for the excess vascular volume as fluid shifts back to the intravascular space, heart failure and pulmonary edema may result. The patient is assessed for signs of heart failure, including decreased cardiac output, oliguria, jugular vein distention, persistent edema, and the onset of an S<sub>3</sub> or S<sub>4</sub> heart sound. If invasive hemodynamic monitoring is used, increasing central venous, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures indicate increased fluid volume.</p>
<p class="indent">Crackles in the lungs and increased difficulty with breathing may indicate pulmonary edema, which should be reported promptly to the primary provider. In the meantime, the patient is positioned comfortably, with the head of the bed raised (if not contraindicated by other treatments or injuries) to promote lung expansion and gas exchange. Management of this complication includes providing supplemental oxygen, administering IV diuretic agents, carefully assessing the patient&#x2019;s response, and providing vasoactive medications, if indicated (see <a href="c25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>).</p>
<p class="h7">Sepsis</p>
<p class="nonindent">Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injuries. The signs of early sepsis are subtle, requiring a high index of suspicion and very close monitoring of changes in the patient&#x2019;s status. One of the challenges in recognizing sepsis is that burns are a noninfectious condition that triggers the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), making it difficult to predict and diagnosis sepsis (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4125">Hill, Percy, Velamuri, et al., 2018</a>). Because patients with burns are hypermetabolic, they display tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated body temperature. These physiologic norms in patients with burns make the diagnosis of sepsis more challenging. See <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> for treatment recommendations for sepsis.</p>
<p class="h7">Delirium</p>
<p class="nonindent">Delirium, a transient and often reversible state of acute brain dysfunction which manifests as alterations in consciousness or cognitive function compared to the patient&#x2019;s baseline, may occur in patients secondary to the trauma sustained. Symptoms include restlessness, disorientation, sleep disorders, or anxiety; some patients experience hallucinations, delusions, or even become combative or suicidal. In patients with burns, a higher incidence of delirium has been found in those with a history of psychiatric issues or substance abuse, or in those with larger burns (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4110">Low, Meyer, Willebrand, et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">There is ample literature to support the negative impact that pain, anxiety, and agitation have on both clinical and functional outcomes for patients with critical illnesses, yet this is not so for patients with burns who are in critical-care units. Depetris, Raineri, Pantet, and colleagues (2018) sought to assess current analgesia, sedation, and delirium monitoring and treatments in critical burn care to evaluate practice variations and adherence to current evidence-based practices. Although they found increasing awareness of patient delirium among burn care providers, delirium prevention practices vary widely, and they recommend further studies to establish burn-specific guidelines for prevention and treatment of this critical complication of severe burns (see Nursing Research Profile in <a href="#ct57-6">Chart 57-6</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="box2"><p class="Box2pTitle"><strong>Nursing Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs About Delirium in a Burn ICU</strong></p>
<p class="Box2pRef">Powell, T. L., Nolan, M., Yang, G., et al. (2019). Nursing understanding and perceptions of delirium: Assessing current knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in a burn ICU. <em>Journal of Burn Care and Research</em>, <em>40</em>(4), 471&#x2013;477.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Patients with burns are at high risk for the development of delirium due to analgesia and sedation needs, prolonged mechanical ventilation, multiple operative procedures, and extended intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Delirium has grave negative effects on morbidity, mortality, and cognitive function and is common in this population. As the caregiver who spends the most time with the patient, the nurse must be attuned to early signs of delirium and initiate treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and improve nurses&#x2019; perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge about delirium while increasing compliance with administration of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) tool and preventive interventions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The setting for this study was an 18-bed multispecialty burn ICU for both adults and children. Participants completed a survey that assessed attitudes regarding delirium, use of the CAM-ICU, and general knowledge of delirium before and after an educational intervention designed to improve recognition, prevention, and management of delirium The researchers conducted a review of the literature and sought expert consultation to inform the development of the survey, which included select items used in the American Nurses Association (2015), study on delirium. In addition, post intervention, participants were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational activities. The educational intervention, which occurred over 7 months, consisted of training a group of delirium nurse champions to serve as expert resources for the staff, creating an education board that addressed common questions and myths regarding delirium, and coordinating a week dedicated to delirium educational activities, including short videos and question and answer sessions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">Twenty-seven (38%) of the 71 burn ICU nurses participated in the project. Staff compliance with administration of the CAM-ICU assessment increased to 90% during the review time, and positive scores on the CAM-ICU decreased from 21% to 14%. Survey results indicated that nurses recognized the importance of assessing delirium and providing interventions. However, 26% of the nurses did not endorse the need for the CAM-ICU as a screening tool. Qualitative themes described existing knowledge of delirium and knowledge gaps, barriers to implementation of the CAM-ICU, and views on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic nursing interventions.</p>
<p class="BoxpTitlepH1"><strong>Nursing Implications</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The results from this study support that targeted education increased awareness and general knowledge of delirium, as well as appropriate nursing interventions. However, the authors found that participants perceived challenges to using the CAM-ICU, including the time it takes to conduct the assessment and the complexity of using it with patients who are non-English speaking, sedated, or intubated, which limited behavioral change or consistent use of the tool. In general, staff perceived the project as empowering, specifically as the project helped to reinforce the role that nurses play in delirium prevention and management and the positive difference that their interventions make in this patient population.</p>
</div>
<p class="superMheadpH2" id="m12">Rehabilitation Phase</p>
<p class="nonindent">Rehabilitation begins immediately after the burn has occurred and often extends for years after the initial injury. For nurses who care for patients with burns, this can be one of the more physically demanding and challenging phases. One important focus of the burn team is to evaluate the patient carefully for late complications related to burn injuries as described in <a href="#tt57-5">Table 57-5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Burn rehabilitation is comprehensive, complex, and requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychosocial recovery related to the injury. As patients begin to recover, they become more aware of the injuries and challenges they face. Individualized plans of care that are specific to the severity and location of injury are developed and reevaluated frequently. The increased survival of patients with significant burn injuries has translated into the need for additional and comprehensive burn rehabilitation programs worldwide. The ultimate goal is to return patients to the highest level of function possible within the context of their injuries. Specially trained occupational and physical therapists are essential for optimal patient outcomes.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2715">Psychological Support</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A patient&#x2019;s outlook, motivation, and support system are important to their overall well-being and ability to progress through the rehabilitation phase. Psychiatric disorders may have contributed to the cause of the burn injury itself. Examples include self-inflicted burns, suicide attempts, or intentional infliction on one person by another in cases of abuse. These are a few examples that illustrate the critical need for psychosocial resources in burn recovery. Although psychiatric disorders are not contributory to all burn injuries, the life-altering nature of burn injuries almost always causes temporary or permanent impairment of psychosocial adaptation.</p>
<p class="indent">In the acute phase of the injury, acute shock, terror, disbelief, confusion, and anxiety are common. Patients may be at risk for delirium and may experience temporary psychoses. Patients may be confused from medications they are taking, but they have an underlying sense of fear, anxiety, and pain. Early consultation with mental health professionals will assist in best meeting individual needs, which may include pharmacologic interventions with concurrent counseling. The rehabilitation phase may present a new set of challenges. While the patient is physically recovering, the reality and impact of the injury begin to set in as patients recognize that survival is expected. Patients may experience devastating grief and loss. The sense of loss may originate from physical injury, loss of control from the forced dependency on others for care, or loss of family members/friends who may have died from burn injuries. In residential fires, survivors may have lost their homes and all of their possessions.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric disorder in patients with burns. Patients with PTSD re-experience the injury event, exhibit an intensified perception of threat, and employ avoidance behaviors that sustain the symptoms (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4160">Low et al., 2018</a>). Other psychological disorders that may be experienced by patients with burns include anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. The symptoms and psychological responses to stress are discussed further in <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">As recovery progresses, discharge planning must include strategies to assist the patient in reintegrating into their home, community, workplace, and school. For many patients, issues regarding quality of life may become very real at this point in recovery. This is an emotional time as the patient and family begin to live with new physical limitations and challenges in relationships. In addition to preparing the patient&#x2019;s support system, the patient and family must also prepare for the reactions from strangers.</p>
<p class="indent">Organizations such as the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, an international support group for patients with burns, offer a myriad of resources, education, opportunities for peer support, and strategies for reintegration. Alan Breslau, a survivor of burn injuries, who recognized the importance of peer support in psychosocial recovery (see the Resources section), founded the Phoenix Society in 1977. Peer support provides opportunities for reflection and personal growth and gives new meaning for the patient with burns through sharing experiences with others with similar burn injuries. Each year, the Phoenix Society hosts the World Burn Congress, which is a conference for survivors, their families, caregivers, burn care professionals, and firefighters. This forum offers education as well as an opportunity for patients with burns and their families to connect with others who have experienced similar life-changing events. Such interaction allows the patient and family to see that adaptation to a burn injury is possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Organizations that provide support for reintegration are able to offer education and training geared specifically to patients with burn injuries. Workshops on how to apply makeup to reduce the appearance of scars can benefit those with obvious facial scarring. This is one example of a strategy available to assist patients with burns who have body image disturbances. Cultural influences play a strong factor in this process, because some cultures are particularly sensitive to physical appearance, a focus of importance which may also be reinforced by current media practices. The role of the nurse is to encourage patients to voice their concerns, provide empathy, and provide them with assistive resources.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s2716">Abnormal Wound Healing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Partial-thickness wounds involving the epidermis and superficial dermis tend to heal without scarring. Deeper wounds will likely develop scarring of variable degrees. As with other disorders, risk factors may be stratified as modifiable or nonmodifiable. For example, a nonmodifiable risk factor for scarring is heredity, because some patients are simply more prone to hypertrophic scar formation. The focus of patient education for nurses must be on how to best change or adapt the <em>modifiable</em> risk factors. Patients should be strongly encouraged to follow occupational therapist recommendations for scar prevention and management.</p>
<p class="indent">Normal scarring occurs in a superficial tissue injury and begins forming within 7 to 10 days post injury and progresses over the next 6 to 12 months. Abnormal scarring occurs after a longer period of wound healing and may form either hypertrophic or keloid scars.</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 1888</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page1889" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1889">p. 1889</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Hypertrophic and Keloid Scars</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertrophic scars form within the boundaries of the initial wound and push outward on the perimeter of the wound. They are common in areas over joints and in the younger population. The scar becomes red (due to its hypervascularity), raised, and hard.</p>
<p class="indent">Keloid scars are irregularly formed and extend beyond the margins of the original wound. They are large, nodular, and ropelike, often causing itching and tenderness. They are more common in dark-pigmented skin, uncommon in children and older adults, and have familial tendencies.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Prevention and Treatment of Scars</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preventive treatment modalities aimed at scar contractures and excess hypertrophic tissue are routinely employed. Compression is introduced early in burn wound treatment. Elastic bandage wraps used initially help promote adequate circulation, but they can also be used as the first form of compression for scar management, followed by elasticized tubular bandages until the patient can be measured for a customized garment. Application of elastic pressure garments loosens collagen bundles and encourages parallel orientation of the collagen to the skin surface. As pressure continues over time, collagen restructures and vascularity decreases. Although this therapy is somewhat controversial, pressure has shown to be beneficial in controlling scar formation over time (<a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#bib4120">DeBruler, Baumann, Blackstone, et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Recommended garment wear time is 23 hours per day; removing for bathing or wound care only.</p>
<p class="indent">Many areas of the body are difficult to compress due to the contours or location of the injury. Inserts, such as silicone sheets, are helpful for these small troublesome areas and are placed beneath the garment or compression dressing to enhance scar compression. Gentle superficial scar massage can be performed with a moisturizer several times a day.</p>
<p class="indent">Burn reconstruction is a treatment option after scars have matured and is discussed within the first few years after injury. This decision requires individualized planning, realistic expectations, and patience.

<p class="processppara">The nurse obtains information about the patient&#x2019;s education level, occupation, leisure activities, cultural background, religion, and family interactions. The patient&#x2019;s self-concept, mental status, emotional response to the injury and subsequent hospitalization, level of intellectual functioning, previous hospitalizations, response to pain and pain relief measures, and sleep pattern are also essential components of a comprehensive assessment. Information about the patient&#x2019;s general self-concept, self-esteem, and coping strategies in the past are valuable in assessing emotional needs.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Ongoing physical assessments related to rehabilitation goals include range of motion of affected joints, functional abilities in ADLs, early signs of skin breakdown, evidence of neuropathies (nerve damage), activity tolerance, and quality or condition of healing skin. The patient&#x2019;s participation in care and ability to demonstrate self-care in such areas as ambulation, eating, wound cleaning, toileting, and applying pressure wraps are documented on a regular basis.</p>

<p class="processppara">Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1First56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Activity intolerance associated with pain with exercise, limited joint mobility, muscle wasting, and limited endurance</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Disturbed body image associated with altered physical appearance and self-concept</p>

<p class="processppara">Potential complications may include the following:</p>
<p class="ProcessBL1Middle56"><span class="bull1a">&#x2022;</span>Inadequate psychological adaptation to burn injury</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Planning and Goals</strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The major goals for the patient include increased mobility and participation in ADLs; adaptation and adjustment to alterations in body image, self-concept, and lifestyle; increased understanding and knowledge of the injury, treatment, and planned follow-up care; and absence of complications.</p>
<p class="processptitleph2"><strong>Nursing Interventions</strong></p>
<p class="processptitleph3"><strong>P<span class="small">ROMOTING</span> A<span class="small">CTIVITY</span> T<span class="small">OLERANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="processppara">The extensive physical rehabilitation can be painful and challenging for the patient. Strategies to maintain motivation and participation may be beneficial during this critical phase. The nurse incorporates physical and occupational therapy exercises in the patient&#x2019;s care to prevent muscle atrophy and to maintain the mobility required for daily activities. The patient&#x2019;s activity tolerance, strength, and endurance gradually increase if activity occurs over increasingly longer periods. Monitoring of fatigue and pain tolerance will assist with determining the amount of activity to be encouraged on a daily basis. Activities such as family visits and recreational therapy (e.g., video games, radio, television) can provide diversion, improve the patient&#x2019;s outlook, and increase tolerance for physical activity. In older adult patients and those with chronic illness and disability, rehabilitation must take into account preexisting functional abilities and limitations.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">The nurse must schedule care in such a way that the patient has periods of rest and uninterrupted sleep. A good time for planned patient rest is after the stress of dressing changes and exercise, while pain interventions and sedatives are still effective. This plan must be clearly communicated to family members and other care providers. The patient may have insomnia related to frequent nightmares about the burn injury or other fears and anxieties about the outcome of the injury. The nurse reassures the patient and administers agents, as prescribed, to promote sleep. Reducing metabolic stress by relieving pain, preventing chilling or fever, and promoting the physical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1890" title="1890"></span>integrity of all body systems helps the patient conserve energy for therapeutic activities and wound healing.</p>

<p class="processppara">Patients who have survived burn injuries may lack the benefit of anticipatory grief often seen in a patient who is approaching surgery or dealing with the terminal illness of a loved one. As care progresses, the patient who is recovering from burns becomes aware of daily improvement and begins to express basic concerns: Will I be disfigured or be disabled? How long will I be in the hospital? What about my job and family? Will I ever be independent again? How will this injury affect my sexual relationships? How can I pay for my care? Was my burn the result of my carelessness? Where will I live now?</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">When caring for a patient with a burn injury, the nurse needs to be aware that there are prejudices and misunderstandings in society about those viewed as different. Opportunities and accommodations available to others are often denied to those disfigured by scarring associated with a burn injury. These include social participation, employment, prestige, various roles, and status. The healthcare team must actively promote a healthy body image and self-concept in patients with burn injuries so that they can accept or challenge others&#x2019; perceptions of those who are disfigured or disabled. Survivors themselves must show others who they are, how they function, and how they want to be treated.</p>

<p class="processppara">With early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy, contractures or hypertrophic scars are rarely a long-term complication. However, surgical intervention is indicated if full range of motion in the patient with burns is not achieved.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Impaired Psychological Adaptation to the Burn Injury.</span> Some patients, particularly those with limited coping skills or psychological function, or a history of psychiatric problems before the burn injury, may not achieve adequate psychological adaptation to the burn injury. Psychological counseling or psychiatric referral may be made to assess the patient&#x2019;s emotional status, to help the patient develop coping skills, and to intervene if major psychological issues or ineffective coping is identified.</p>

<p class="processptitleph4indent"><img class="m" src="images/rtxticon2.jpg" alt=""/> <span class="yltxt">Educating the Patient About Self-Care.</span> The focus of rehabilitative interventions is directed toward outpatient care, home care, or care in a rehabilitation center. This includes wound care, dressing changes, pain management, nutrition, prevention of complications, and other care needs. Information and written instructions are provided about specific exercises and the use of pressure garments and splints. The patient and family are provided education to assist them in their continued care needs after discharge (see <a href="c57-sec03.xhtml#ct57-7">Chart 57-7</a>).</p>
<p class="processptitleph4indent"><span class="yltxt">Continuing and Transitional Care.</span> After discharge, care by a multidisciplinary treatment team is necessary. Some patients may require the services of an inpatient rehabilitation center before returning home. Patients should receive follow-up from a burn center when possible for periodic evaluation by the burn team, modification of outpatient treatment plan, and evaluation for reconstructive surgery. Many patients require outpatient physical or occupational therapy several times a week. The nurse coordinates all aspects of care and ensures that the patient&#x2019;s needs are met. Such coordination is an important aspect of assisting the patient to achieve independence.</p>
<p class="processpparapindent">Some patients may require referral for transitional care after discharge. The nurse assesses the patient&#x2019;s physical and psychological status as well as the adequacy of the home setting for safe and adequate care. The nurse monitors the patient&#x2019;s progress; assesses adherence to the plan of care; and assists the patient and family with wound care, exercises, and other physical needs. Patients experiencing difficulties with psychosocial adjustments are identified and appropriate referrals are made (see <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="c02-sec01.xhtml#ct2-6">Chart 2-6</a>, for further discussion about assisting the patient&#x2019;s preparation for home care).</p>
