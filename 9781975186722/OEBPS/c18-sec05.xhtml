<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s566">Acute Pharyngitis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Acute <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pharyngitis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the throat">pharyngitis</button></strong> is a sudden painful inflammation of the pharynx, the back portion of the throat that includes the posterior third of the tongue, soft palate, and tonsils. It is commonly referred to as a sore throat. In the United States, approximately 12 million health care visits are due to acute pharyngitis each year (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Chow &#x0026; Doron, 2018</a>). Because of environmental exposure to viral agents and poorly ventilated rooms, the incidence of viral pharyngitis peaks during winter and early spring in regions that have warm summers and cold winters. Viral pharyngitis spreads easily in the droplets of coughs and sneezes, as well as from unclean hands that have been exposed to the contaminated fluids.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s567">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Viral infection causes most cases of acute pharyngitis. Responsible viruses include the adenovirus, influenza virus, Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus. Bacterial infection accounts for the remainder of cases. Five percent to 15% of adults with pharyngitis have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which is commonly referred to as group A streptococcus (GAS) or streptococcal pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis warrants the use of antibiotic treatment. When GAS causes acute pharyngitis, the condition is known as strep throat. The body responds by triggering an inflammatory response in the pharynx. This results in pain, fever, vasodilation, edema, and tissue damage, manifested by redness and swelling in the tonsillar pillars, uvula, and soft palate. A creamy exudate may be present in the tonsillar pillars (<a href="#ff18-2">Fig.&#x00A0;18-2</a>). Other organisms implicated in acute pharyngitis include groups B and G streptococci, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum,</em> and HIV (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Chow &#x0026; Doron, 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Uncomplicated viral infections usually subside promptly, within 3 to 10 days after onset. However, pharyngitis caused by bacteria, such as GAS, is a more severe illness. If left untreated, the complications can be severe and life-threatening. Complications include rhinosinusitis, otitis media, peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, and cervical adenitis. In rare cases, the infection may lead to sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis (Buensalido, 2019a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s568">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The signs and symptoms of acute pharyngitis include a fiery-red pharyngeal membrane and tonsils, lymphoid follicles that are swollen and flecked with white-purple exudate, enlarged and tender cervical lymph nodes, and no cough. Fever (higher than 38.3&#x00B0;C [101&#x00B0;F]) and malaise also may be present. Occasionally, patients with GAS pharyngitis exhibit vomiting, anorexia, and a scarlatina-form rash with urticaria known as scarlet fever.</p>
<p class="indent">People who have streptococcal pharyngitis suddenly develop a painful sore throat 1 to 5 days after being exposed to the streptococcus bacteria. They usually report malaise, fever (with or without chills), headache, myalgia, painful cervical adenopathy, and nausea. The tonsils appear swollen and erythematous, and they may or may not have an exudate. The roof of the mouth is often erythematous and may demonstrate petechiae. Bad breath is common.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s569">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Accurate diagnosis of pharyngitis is essential to determine the cause (viral or bacterial) and to initiate treatment early. Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) uses swabs that collect specimens from the posterior pharynx and tonsil. RADT is reported to be 90% to 95% sensitive, thus facilitating earlier <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page504" title="504"></span>treatment and earlier symptom improvement and reductions in pathogen transmission. Negative results should be confirmed by a throat culture (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Acerra, 2018</a>). In most communities, preliminary culture reports are available in 24 hours. Once a definitive diagnosis of GAS is made, administration of appropriate antibiotics hastens symptom resolution and reduces the transmission of the illness.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s570">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Viral pharyngitis is treated with supportive measures because antibiotics have no effect on the causal organism. Bacterial pharyngitis is treated with a variety of antimicrobial agents (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1426">Uyeki, Bernstein, Bradley, et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pharmacologic Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the cause of pharyngitis is bacterial, penicillin is usually the treatment of choice. Penicillin V potassium given orally for 10 days is the regimen of choice. Penicillin injections are recommended only if there is a concern that the patient will not adhere to therapy (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1376">Papadakis et&#x00A0;al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">For patients who are allergic to penicillin or have organisms that are resistant to erythromycin (one fifth of GAS and most <em>S. aureus</em> organisms are resistant to penicillin and erythromycin), cephalosporins and macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) may be used. Once-daily azithromycin may be given for only 3 days due to its long half-life (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Acerra, 2018</a>). A 5- or 10-day course of cephalosporin may be prescribed. Five-day administration of cefpodoxime and cefuroxime has also been successful in producing bacteriologic cures.</p>
<p class="indent">Severe sore throats can also be relieved by analgesic medications. For example, aspirin or acetaminophen can be taken at 4- to 6-hour intervals; if required, acetaminophen with codeine can be taken three or four times daily. In severe cases, gargles with benzocaine may relieve symptoms.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nutritional Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A liquid or soft diet is provided during the acute stage of the disease, depending on the patient&#x2019;s appetite and the degree of discomfort that occurs with swallowing. Cool beverages, warm liquids, and flavored frozen desserts such as ice pops are often soothing. Occasionally, the throat is so sore that liquids cannot be taken in adequate amounts by mouth. In severe situations, intravenous (IV) fluids may be needed. Otherwise, the patient is encouraged to drink as much fluid as possible (at least 2 to 3 L/day).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s571">Nursing Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nursing care for patients with viral pharyngitis focuses on symptomatic management. For patients who demonstrate signs of strep throat and have a history of rheumatic fever, who have scarlet fever, or who have symptoms suggesting peritonsillar abscess, nursing care focuses on prompt initiation and correct administration of prescribed antibiotic therapy. The nurse instructs the patient about signs and symptoms that warrant prompt contact with the primary provider. These include dyspnea, drooling, inability to swallow, and inability to fully open the mouth.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse instructs the patient to stay in bed during the febrile stage of illness and to rest frequently once up and about. Used tissues should be disposed of properly to prevent the spread of infection. The nurse (or the patient or family member, if the patient is not hospitalized) should examine the skin once or twice daily for possible rash, because acute pharyngitis may precede some other communicable diseases (e.g., rubella).</p>
<p class="indent">Depending on the severity of the pharyngitis and the degree of pain, warm saline gargles or throat irrigations are used. The benefits of this treatment depend on the degree of heat that is applied. The nurse educates the patient about these procedures and about the recommended temperature of the solution, which should be high enough to be effective and as warm as the patient can tolerate, usually 40.6&#x00B0; to 43.3&#x00B0;C (105&#x00B0; to 110&#x00B0;F). Irrigating the throat may reduce spasm in the pharyngeal muscles and relieve soreness of the throat.</p>
<p class="indent">An ice collar also can relieve severe sore throats. Mouth care may promote the patient&#x2019;s comfort and prevent the development of fissures (cracking) of the lips and oral inflammation when bacterial infection is present. The nurse instructs the patient to resume activity gradually and to delay returning to work or school until after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. A full course of antibiotic therapy is indicated in patients with strep infection because of the potential complications such as nephritis and rheumatic fever, which may have their onset 2 or 3 weeks after the pharyngitis has subsided. The nurse instructs the patient and family about the importance of taking the full course of antibiotic therapy and informs them about the symptoms to watch for that may indicate complications.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the nurse instructs the patient about preventive measures that include not sharing eating utensils, glasses, napkins, food, or towels; cleaning telephones after use; using a tissue to cough or sneeze; disposing of used tissues appropriately; coughing or sneezing into the upper arm if tissues are not readily available; and avoiding exposure to tobacco and secondhand smoke. The nurse also instructs the patient with pharyngitis, especially streptococcal pharyngitis, to replace their toothbrush with a new one.</p>
<h3 class="superMheadpH2" id="s572">Chronic Pharyngitis</h3>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic pharyngitis is a persistent inflammation of the pharynx. It is common in adults who work in dusty surroundings, use their voice to excess, suffer from chronic cough, or habitually use alcohol and tobacco.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three types of chronic pharyngitis:</p>
<ul class="bull"><li><span>Hypertrophic&#x2014;characterized by general thickening and congestion of the pharyngeal mucous membrane</span></li>
<li><span>Atrophic&#x2014;probably a late stage of the first type (the membrane is thin, whitish, glistening, and at times wrinkled)</span></li>
<li><span>Chronic granular&#x2014;characterized by numerous swollen lymph follicles on the pharyngeal wall</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="s573">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with chronic pharyngitis complain of a constant sense of irritation or fullness in the throat, mucus that collects in the throat and can be expelled by coughing, and difficulty swallowing. This is often associated with intermittent postnasal drip that causes minor irritation and inflammation of the pharynx. A sore throat that is worse with swallowing in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page505" title="505"></span>absence of pharyngitis suggests the possibility of thyroiditis, and patients with this symptom are referred for the evaluation of possible thyroiditis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s574">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment of chronic pharyngitis is based on relieving symptoms; avoiding exposure to irritants; and correcting any upper respiratory, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or cardiac condition that might be responsible for a chronic cough.</p>
<p class="indent">Nasal congestion may be relieved by short-term use of nasal sprays or medications containing ephedrine sulfate or phenylephrine. For a patient with a history of allergy, one of the antihistamine decongestant medications, such as pseudoephedrine or brompheniramine/pseudoephedrine, is prescribed orally every 4 to 6 hours. Aspirin (for patients older than 20 years) or acetaminophen is recommended for its analgesic properties.</p>
<p class="indent">For adults with chronic pharyngitis, tonsillectomy may be offered as an option, although its effectiveness in reaping long-term improvement in symptoms has not been established (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1392">Burton, Glasziou, Chong, et&#x00A0;al., 2014</a>). For further information, see the Tonsillitis and Adenoiditis section.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s575">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><img class="m" src="images/patienteducation.png" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse recommends avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, ENDS use, secondhand smoke, and exposure to cold or to environmental or occupational pollutants. The patient may minimize exposure to pollutants by wearing a disposable facemask, preferably an N95 mask, which can filter out 95% of small particles, including dusts and molds (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1409">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2018</a>). The nurse encourages the patient to drink plenty of fluids. Gargling with warm saline solution may relieve throat discomfort. Lozenges keep the throat moistened (<a href="c18-sec14.xhtml#bib1440">Stead, 2017</a>).</p>
