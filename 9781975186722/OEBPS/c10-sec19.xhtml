<h4 class="h4" id="s312">Types of Intravenous Solutions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">IV solutions are categorized as isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic, according to whether their total osmolality is the same as, less than, or greater than that of blood, respectively (see earlier discussion of osmolality and tonicity). Electrolyte solutions are considered isotonic if the total electrolyte content (anions + cations) is between 250 and 375 mEq/L, hypotonic if the total electrolyte content is less than 250 mEq/L, and hypertonic if the total electrolyte content is greater than 375 mEq/L. The nurse must also consider a solution&#x2019;s osmolality, keeping in mind that the osmolality of plasma is approximately 300 mOsm/L (300 mmol/L). For example, a 10% dextrose solution has an osmolality of approximately 505 mOsm/L, which is greater than the osmolality of the bloodstream (Emmett &#x0026; Palmer, 2018a).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s313">Isotonic Fluids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fluids that are classified as isotonic have a total osmolality close to that of the ECF and do not cause cells to shrink or swell. When isotonic fluids are administered they expand the ECF volume. One liter of isotonic fluid expands the ECF by 1 L; however, isotonic solution expands the plasma component of ECF by only 0.25 L. An isotonic solution is a crystalloid solution (water containing soluble mineral salts). Plasma is a colloidal solution. A colloidal solution is a mixture of fluid containing insoluble large particles, such as proteins. Colloidal solutions exert oncotic pressure; crystalloids do not exert oncotic pressure (Siparsky, 2019; Sterns, 2018a).</p>

<p class="indent">Because isotonic fluids expand the water volume in the intravascular space, patients with heart failure or hypertension <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page265" title="265"></span>who receive isotonic solutions should be carefully monitored for signs of fluid overload (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Siparsky, 2019</a>).</p>

<p class="Box3pTitle"><strong>Assessing Arterial Blood Gases</strong></p>
<p class="BoxpPARA">The following steps are recommended to evaluate arterial blood gas values. They are based on the assumption that the average values are:</p>
<p class="BoxUL2First">pH = 7.35&#x2013;7.45</p>
<p class="BoxUL2Middle">PaCO<sub>2</sub> = 35&#x2013;45 mm Hg</p>
<p class="BoxUL2Middle">HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> = 24 to 27 mEq/L</p>
<p class="BoxNL1First"><span class="numah"><strong>1.</strong></span><em>First, note the pH.</em> It can be high, low, or normal, as follows:</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont">A normal pH may indicate perfectly normal blood gases, <em>or</em> it may indicate a <em>compensated</em> imbalance. A compensated imbalance is one in which the body has been able to correct the pH by either respiratory or metabolic changes (depending on the primary problem). For example, a patient with primary metabolic acidosis starts out with a low bicarbonate level but a normal CO<sub>2</sub> level. Soon afterward, the lungs try to compensate for the imbalance by exhaling large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> (hyperventilation). As another example, a patient with primary respiratory acidosis starts out with a high CO<sub>2</sub> level; soon afterward, the kidneys attempt to compensate by retaining bicarbonate. If the compensatory mechanism is able to restore the bicarbonate to carbonic acid ratio back to 20:1, full compensation (and thus normal pH) will be achieved.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont">pH &#x003E; 7.45 (alkalosis)</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont">pH &#x003C; 7.35 (acidosis)</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont">pH = 7.4 (normal)</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>2.</strong></span>The next step is to determine the primary cause of the disturbance. This is done by evaluating the PaCO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> in relation to the pH.</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont"><strong>Example: pH &#x003E; 7.45 (alkalosis)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>a.</strong></span>If the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is less than 35 mm Hg, the primary disturbance is respiratory alkalosis. (This situation occurs when a patient hyperventilates and &#x201C;blows off&#x201D; too much CO<sub>2</sub>. Recall that CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in water becomes carbonic acid, the acid side of the &#x201C;carbonic acid&#x2013;bicarbonate buffer system.&#x201D;)</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>b.</strong></span>If the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is greater than 27 mEq/L, the primary disturbance is metabolic alkalosis. (This situation occurs when the body gains too much bicarbonate, an alkaline substance. Bicarbonate is the basic or alkaline side of the &#x201C;carbonic acid&#x2013;bicarbonate buffer system.&#x201D;)</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont"><strong>Example: pH</strong> <strong>&#x003C;</strong> <strong>7.35 (acidosis)</strong></p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>c.</strong></span>If the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is greater than 40 mm Hg, the primary disturbance is respiratory acidosis. (This situation occurs when a patient hypoventilates and thus retains too much CO<sub>2</sub>, an acidic substance.)</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>d.</strong></span>If the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is less than 24 mEq/L, the primary disturbance is metabolic acidosis. (This situation occurs when the body&#x2019;s bicarbonate level drops, either because of direct bicarbonate loss or because of gains of acids such as lactic acid or ketones.)</p>
<p class="BoxNL1Middle"><span class="numah"><strong>3.</strong></span>The next step involves determining if compensation has begun. This is done by looking at the value other than the primary disorder. If it is moving in the same direction as the primary value, compensation is under way. Consider the following gases:</p>
<p class="BoxNL2Middlepcont">The first set (1) indicates acute respiratory acidosis without compensation (the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is high, the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is normal). The second set (2) indicates chronic respiratory acidosis. Note that compensation has taken place&#x2014;that is, the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> has elevated to an appropriate level to balance the high PaCO<sub>2</sub> and produce a normal pH.</p>

<h6 class="h6">D<sub>5</sub>W</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A solution of D<sub>5</sub>W is unique in that it may be both isotonic and hypotonic (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>). Once given, the glucose is rapidly metabolized, and this initially isotonic solution (same osmolality as serum) then disperses as a hypotonic fluid&#x2014;one third extracellular and two thirds intracellular. It is essential to consider this action of D<sub>5</sub>W, especially if the patient is at risk for increased intracranial pressure. During fluid resuscitation, this solution should not be used because hyperglycemia can result. Therefore, D<sub>5</sub>W is used mainly to supply water and to correct an increased serum osmolality. About 1 L of D<sub>5</sub>W provides less than 170 kcal and is a minor source of the body&#x2019;s daily caloric requirements (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Normal Saline Solution</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) solution contains water, sodium, and chloride. Because the osmolality is entirely contributed by electrolytes, the solution remains within the ECF and expands the intravascular volume. For this reason, normal saline solution is often used to correct an extracellular volume deficit but is not identical to ECF. It is used with administration of blood transfusions and to replace large sodium losses, such as in burn injuries. It should not be used in heart failure, pulmonary edema, renal impairment, or sodium retention. Normal saline does not supply calories (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="pagebreak_container"><span class="pagebreak">p. 265</span><div class="rule"></div><span id="page266" class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="266">p. 266</span></div>
<h6 class="h6">Other Isotonic Solutions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Several other solutions contain ions in addition to sodium and chloride and are somewhat similar to the ECF in composition. Lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution contains potassium and calcium in addition to sodium chloride. It is used to correct dehydration, blood loss, and sodium depletion and to replace GI losses.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s314">Hypotonic Fluids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One purpose of hypotonic solution is to replace fluid, because it is hypotonic compared with plasma. Another purpose of hypotonic solution is to provide free water. At times, hypotonic sodium solutions are used to treat hypernatremia and other hyperosmolar conditions. Half-strength saline (0.45% sodium chloride) solution is frequently used.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s315">Hypertonic Fluids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertonic fluids include 3% NaCl and IV mannitol. If a patient is sodium depleted, a hypertonic sodium IV solution might be used. If a patient is experiencing acute cerebral edema, IV mannitol is often used. Hypertonic solutions pull water from the interstitial and intracellular compartments into the bloodstream. These solutions draw water out of intracellular compartments causing cellular dehydration (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>). Normal saline and lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution are considered isotonic solutions. When 5% dextrose (D<sub>5</sub>W) is added to normal saline solution or lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution, the total osmolality exceeds that of the ECF. With the added dextrose, these are then considered hypertonic solutions. However, the dextrose is quickly metabolized, and after the dextrose is depleted, only the isotonic solution remains. Therefore, any effect on the intracellular compartment is temporary. Similarly, with hypotonic electrolyte solutions containing 5% dextrose, once the dextrose is metabolized, these solutions disperse as hypotonic fluids. However, higher concentrations of dextrose, such as 50% dextrose (D<sub>50</sub>W) in water, are strongly hypertonic. Hypertonic solutions should be administered into central veins so that they can be diluted by large amounts of rapid blood flow (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Saline solutions are also available in osmolar concentrations greater than that of the ECF. These solutions draw water from the ICF to the ECF and cause cells to shrink. If given rapidly or in large quantity, they may cause an extracellular volume excess and precipitate circulatory overload and dehydration. As a result, these solutions must be given cautiously and usually only when the serum osmolality has decreased to dangerously low levels. Hypertonic solutions exert an osmotic pressure greater than that of the ECF (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s316">Other Intravenous Therapies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When the patient is unable to tolerate food, nutritional requirements are often met using the IV route. Solutions may include high concentrations of glucose (such as 50% dextrose in water), protein, or fat to meet nutritional requirements (see <a href="c41.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>). The IV route may also be used to administer colloids, plasma expanders, and blood products (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib842">Hoorn, 2017</a>). Examples of blood products include whole blood, packed RBCs, fresh-frozen plasma, albumin, and cryoprecipitate (these are discussed in more detail in <a href="c28.xhtml">Chapter 28</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Many medications are also delivered by the IV route, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent bolus directly into the vein. Because IV medications enter the circulation rapidly, administration by this route is potentially hazardous. All medications can produce adverse reactions; however, medications given by the IV route can cause these reactions quickly after administration, because the medications are delivered directly into the bloodstream. Administration rates and recommended dilutions for individual medications are available in specialized texts pertaining to IV medications and in manufacturers&#x2019; package inserts; these should be consulted to ensure safe IV administration of medications (<a href="c10-sec20.xhtml#bib783">Institute for Safe Medication Practices [ISMP], 2019</a>).</p>
