<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;cancer:&lt;/b&gt; a group of disorders characterized by abnormal cell proliferation, in which cells ignore growth-regulating signals in the surrounding environment">Cancer</button></strong> is a large group of disorders with different causes, manifestations, treatments, and prognoses. Because cancer can involve any organ system and treatment approaches have the potential for multisystem effects, cancer nursing practice overlaps with numerous nursing specialties. Cancer nursing practice covers all age groups and is carried out in various settings, including acute care institutions, outpatient centers, physician offices, rehabilitation facilities, the home, and long-term care facilities. The scope, responsibilities, and goals of cancer nursing, also called <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;oncology:&lt;/b&gt; field or study of cancer">oncology</button></strong> nursing, are as diverse and complex as those of any nursing specialty. Nursing management of the patient with oncologic disorders includes care of patients throughout the cancer trajectory from prevention through end-of-life care (see <a href="c12-sec01.xhtml#ff12-1">Fig.&#x00A0;12-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;precision medicine:&lt;/b&gt; using advances in research, technology, and policies to develop individualized plans of care to prevent and treat disease">Precision medicine</button></strong> is possible because of the recent development of biologic databases (e.g., human genome sequencing), technologic advances that can identify unique characteristics of individual persons (e.g., genomics, cellular assay tests), and computer-driven systems that can mine and analyze datasets (see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>). This is an exciting time for oncology as the overall goal of the precision medicine initiative is to focus on preventing and curing cancers (<a href="c12-sec08.xhtml#bib1081">Ginsburg &#x0026; Phillips, 2018</a>).</p>
