<h4 class="h4" id="s1657">Gastritis</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gastritis:&lt;/b&gt; inflammation of the stomach">Gastritis</button></strong> (inflammation of the gastric or stomach mucosa) is a common GI problem, accounting for approximately two million visits to outpatient clinics annually in the United States, with increasing prevalence occurring in adults older than 60 years of age (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3010">Wehbi, Dacha, Sarver, et al., 2019</a>). It affects women and men about equally. Gastritis may be acute, lasting several hours to a few days, or chronic, resulting from repeated exposure to irritating agents or recurring episodes of acute gastritis.</p>
<p class="indent">Acute gastritis may be classified as erosive or nonerosive, based on pathologic manifestations present in the gastric mucosa (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Wehbi et al., 2019</a>). The erosive form of acute gastritis is most often caused by local irritants such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen); corticosteroids; alcohol consumption; and gastric radiation therapy (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2997">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2020a; Norris, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Wehbi et al., 2019</a>). The nonerosive form of acute gastritis is most often caused by an infection with a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium, <strong><em>Helicobacter pylori</em></strong> <strong>(</strong><strong><em>H. pylori</em></strong><strong>)</strong> (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3010">Wehbi et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). It is estimated that 50% of individuals globally are infected with <em>H. pylori</em> (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Santacroce &#x0026; Bhutani, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A more severe form of acute gastritis is caused by the ingestion of strong acid or alkali, which may cause the mucosa to become gangrenous or to perforate (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>). Scarring can occur, resulting in pyloric <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;stenosis:&lt;/b&gt; narrowing or obstruction of a cardiac valve&#x2019;s orifice">stenosis</button></strong> (narrowing or tightening) or obstruction. Acute gastritis also may develop in acute illnesses, especially when the patient has had major traumatic injuries, burns, severe infection, lack of perfusion to the stomach lining, or major surgery. This type of acute gastritis is often referred to as <em>stress-related gastritis or ulcer</em> (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2979">Clarke, Ferraro, Gbadehan, et al., 2020</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic gastritis is often classified according to the underlying causative mechanism, which most often includes an infection with <em>H. pylori</em>. Chronic <em>H. pylori</em> gastritis is implicated in the development of peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma (cancer), and gastric mucosa&#x2013;associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Akiva &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Lloyd &#x0026; Leiman, 2019</a>). Chronic gastritis may also be caused by a chemical gastric injury (gastropathy) as the result of long-term drug therapy (e.g., aspirin and other NSAIDs) or reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach, which most often occurs after gastric surgery (e.g., gastrojejunostomy, gastroduodenostomy). Autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Addison disease, and Graves disease are also associated with the development of chronic gastritis (see <a href="c45.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>) (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Akiva &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1658">Pathophysiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Gastritis is characterized by a disruption of the mucosal barrier that normally protects the stomach tissue from digestive juices (e.g., hydrochloric acid [HCl] and pepsin). The impaired mucosal barrier allows corrosive HCl, pepsin, and other irritating agents (e.g., alcohol, NSAIDs, <em>H.&#x00A0;pylori</em>) to come in contact with the gastric mucosa, resulting in inflammation. In acute gastritis, this inflammation is usually transient and self-limiting in nature. Inflammation causes the gastric mucosa to become edematous and hyperemic (congested with fluid and blood) and to undergo superficial erosion (<a href="#ff40-1">Fig. 40-1</a>). Superficial ulceration may occur as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1268" title="1268"></span>a result of erosive disease and may lead to hemorrhage. In chronic gastritis, persistent or repeated insults lead to chronic inflammatory changes, and eventually atrophy (or thinning) of the gastric tissue (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Norris, 2019</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1659">Clinical Manifestations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The patient with acute gastritis may have a rapid onset of symptoms, such as epigastric pain or discomfort, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;dyspepsia:&lt;/b&gt; indigestion; upper abdominal discomfort associated with eating">dyspepsia</button></strong> (indigestion; upper abdominal discomfort associated with eating), anorexia, hiccups, or nausea and vomiting, which can last from a few hours to a few days. Erosive gastritis may cause bleeding, which may manifest as blood in vomit or as <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;melena:&lt;/b&gt; tarry or black stools; indicative of occult blood in stools">melena</button></strong> (black, tarry stools; indicative of occult blood in stools) or <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hematochezia:&lt;/b&gt; bright red, bloody stools">hematochezia</button></strong> (bright red, bloody stools) (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Wehbi et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The patient with chronic gastritis may complain of fatigue, <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;pyrosis:&lt;/b&gt; a burning sensation in the stomach and esophagus that moves up to the mouth; commonly called heartburn">pyrosis</button></strong> (a burning sensation in the stomach and esophagus that moves up to the mouth; heartburn) after eating, belching, a sour taste in the mouth, halitosis, early satiety, anorexia, or nausea and vomiting. Some patients may have only mild epigastric discomfort or report intolerance to spicy or fatty foods or slight pain that is relieved by eating (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Akiva &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>). Patients with chronic gastritis may not be able to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> because of diminished production of intrinsic factor by the stomach&#x2019;s parietal cells due to atrophy, which may lead to pernicious anemia (see <a href="c29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a>) (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Zayouna &#x0026; Piper, 2018</a>). Some patients with chronic gastritis have no symptoms (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Marcus &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>) (<a href="#tt40-1">Table 40-1</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1660">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The definitive diagnosis of gastritis is determined by an endoscopy and histologic examination of a tissue specimen obtained by biopsy (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Akiva &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>; <a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3010">Wehbi et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). A complete blood count (CBC) may be drawn to assess for anemia as a result of hemorrhage or pernicious anemia. Diagnostic measures for detecting <em>H. pylori</em> infection may be used and are discussed later in this chapter in the Peptic Ulcer Disease section.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="s1661">Medical Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The gastric mucosa is capable of repairing itself after an episode of acute gastritis. As a rule, the patient recovers in about 1 day, although the patient&#x2019;s appetite may be diminished for an additional 2 or 3 days. Acute gastritis is also managed by instructing the patient to refrain from alcohol and food until symptoms subside. When the patient can take nourishment by mouth, a nonirritating diet is recommended. If the symptoms persist, intravenous (IV) fluids may need to be given. If bleeding is present, management is similar to the procedures used to control upper GI tract hemorrhage discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Therapy is supportive and may include nasogastric (NG) intubation, antacids, histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub> blockers) (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole), and IV fluids (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3010">Wehbi et&#x00A0;al., 2019</a>). Fiberoptic endoscopy may be necessary. In extreme cases, emergency surgery may be required to remove gangrenous or perforated tissue. A gastric resection or a gastrojejunostomy (anastomosis of jejunum to stomach to detour around the pylorus) may be necessary to treat <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;gastric outlet obstruction:&lt;/b&gt; any condition that mechanically impedes normal gastric emptying; there is obstruction of the channel of the pylorus and duodenum through which the stomach empties; also called pyloric obstruction">gastric outlet obstruction</button></strong>, also called <em>pyloric obstruction,</em> a narrowing of the pyloric orifice, which cannot be relieved by medical management.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronic gastritis is managed by modifying the patient&#x2019;s diet, promoting rest, reducing stress, recommending avoidance of alcohol and NSAIDs, and initiating medications that may include antacids, H<sub>2</sub> blockers, or proton pump inhibitors (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib3018">Akiva &#x0026; Greenwald, 2019</a>). <em>H. pylori</em> may be treated with select drug combinations which typically include a proton pump inhibitor, antibiotics, and sometimes bismuth salts (<a href="#tt40-2">Table 40-2</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="s1662">Nursing Management</h5>
<h6 class="h6">Reducing Anxiety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If the patient has ingested acids or alkalis, emergency measures may be necessary (see <a href="c67.xhtml">Chapter 67</a>). The nurse offers supportive therapy to the patient and family during treatment and after the ingested acid or alkali has been neutralized or diluted. In some cases, the nurse may need to prepare the patient for additional diagnostic studies (endoscopies) or surgery. The patient may be anxious because of pain and planned treatment modalities. The nurse uses a calm approach to assess the patient and to answer all questions as completely as possible.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Optimal Nutrition</h6>
<p class="nonindent">For acute gastritis, the nurse provides physical and emotional support and helps the patient manage the symptoms, which may include nausea, vomiting, and pyrosis. The patient should take no foods or fluids by mouth&#x2014;possibly for a few days&#x2014;until the acute symptoms subside, thus allowing the gastric mucosa to heal. If IV therapy is necessary, fluid intake and output are monitored, along with serum electrolyte values. After the symptoms subside, the nurse may offer the patient ice chips followed by clear liquids. Introducing solid food as soon as possible may provide adequate oral nutrition, decrease the need for IV therapy, and minimize irritation to the gastric mucosa. As food is introduced, the nurse evaluates and reports any symptoms that suggest a repeat episode of gastritis.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse discourages the intake of caffeinated beverages, because caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases gastric activity and pepsin secretion. The nurse also discourages alcohol use. Discouraging cigarette smoking is important. The level of nicotine measured in gastric acid can be 10 times greater than arterial blood and 80 times greater than venous blood. Nicotine will increase secretion of gastric acid and will also interfere with the mucosal barrier in the GI tract (<a href="c40-sec04.xhtml#bib2973">Berkowitz, Schultz, Salazar, et al., 2018</a>). When appropriate, the nurse initiates and refers the patient for alcohol counseling and smoking cessation programs.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Promoting Fluid Balance</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Daily fluid intake and output are monitored to detect early signs of dehydration (minimal fluid intake of 1.5 L/day, urine output of less than 1 mL/kg/h). If food and oral fluids are withheld, IV fluids (3 L/day) usually are prescribed and a record of fluid intake plus caloric value (1 L of 5% dextrose in water = 170 calories of carbohydrate) needs to be maintained. Electrolyte values (sodium, potassium, chloride) are assessed every 24 hours to detect any imbalance (see <a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse must always be alert to any indicators of hemorrhagic gastritis, which include <strong><button class="vsm-bubble-widget glossary-term" data-bubble-content="&lt;b&gt;hematemesis:&lt;/b&gt; vomiting of blood">hematemesis</button></strong> (vomiting of blood), tachycardia, and hypotension. All stools should be examined for the presence of frank or occult bleeding. If these occur, the primary provider should be notified, and the patient&#x2019;s vital signs are monitored as the patient&#x2019;s condition warrants. Guidelines for managing upper GI tract bleeding are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Relieving Pain</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Measures to help relieve pain include instructing the patient to avoid foods and beverages that may irritate the gastric mucosa as well as the correct use of medications to relieve chronic gastritis. The nurse must regularly assess the patient&#x2019;s level of pain and the extent of comfort achieved through the use of medications and avoidance of irritating substances.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Promoting Home, Community-Based, and Transitional Care</h6>
<p class="h7"><img class="m" src="images/icon10-sqr.jpg" alt=""/> Educating Patients About Self-Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse evaluates the patient&#x2019;s knowledge about gastritis and develops an individualized education plan that includes information about stress management, diet, and medications (see <a href="#tt40-2">Table 40-2</a>). Dietary instructions take into account the patient&#x2019;s daily caloric needs as well as cultural aspects of food preferences and patterns of eating. The nurse and patient review foods and other substances to be avoided (e.g., spicy, irritating, or highly seasoned foods; caffeine; nicotine; alcohol). Consultation with a dietitian may be recommended (<a href="#ct40-1">Chart 40-1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Providing information about prescribed medications, which may include antacids, H<sub>2</sub> blockers, or proton pump inhibitors, may help the patient to better understand why these medications assist in recovery and prevent recurrence. The importance of completing the medication regimen as prescribed to eradicate <em>H. pylori</em> infection must be reinforced to the patient and caregiver (see later discussion).</p>
<p class="h7">Continuing and Transitional Care</p>
<p class="nonindent">The nurse reinforces previous education and conducts ongoing assessment of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms and progress. Patients with malabsorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> need information about lifelong vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections; the nurse may instruct a family member or caregiver how to administer the injections or make arrangements for the patient to receive the injections from the primary provider. Finally, the nurse emphasizes the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with the primary provider.</p>
